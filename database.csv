Secret Honor	1984	Robert Altman	7.5	Philip Baker Hall	-	
In this speculative one-man drama, we see former President Richard Milhous Nixon alone in his study, dictating his thoughts into a tape recorder. His only company are a four-screen closed-circuit TV setup, the portraits on the walls, a bottle of Chivas Regal - and a loaded pistol. At times addressing an imaginary judge in a court of public opinion, at other times speaking to an aide named Roberto, and sometimes just talking to himself, the former chief executive reflects, in a series of meandering monologues, on his humble Quaker upbringing, his school days, his family and a political career that reached all the way to the White House. Nixon rails at his treatment by the likes of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the "goddam Kennedys," J. Edgar Hoover, Henry Kissinger, Jews, liberals, the media, "East Coast shits," among others, as he leads up to the "true" reasons for the Watergate scandal that resulted in his resignation - an act he regards as one of "secret honor."

Not surprisingly, Bogwood is also the "Garage Sale Capital of the U.S.A." When retirees Doris & Clayton Fenwick decide to empty their nest of retro-modern antiques, they set the wheels in motion for a frantically funny "g-sale" involving Bogwood's most avid garage sale junkies: Angela Cocci (an obsessive market researcher), Ed LaSalle (a beleaguered computer programmer and creator of the cult fantasy role-playing game "Caves & Beasts"), Dick Nickerson (a retired star of the 60s sitcom "Pot o' Gold"), and BJ Harwood & Helen Ziegler (partners and owners of a trendy retro-modern antique store). They try to outmaneuver each other to score their ultimate garage sale treasure: an antique board game worth a fortune. But who will end up with the prize...?

When she was younger, she was a dancer who had dreams of Broadway. Now she's an English teacher for disinterested, upper class middle school kids, and she's dying to let loose.

The mood is set with the opening with excerpts from the Excelsior Ball, a famous ballet at the turn of the century that heralded the advances of the upcoming century, for a book-dealer to introduce the various stories in this compilation film. The first story chosen is (English titles)"Less Than a Day," a comedy of would-be lovers meeting in a country-side rendezvous; ""A Question of Property" is a story of two men who fight over the ownership of a load of manure; "The Idyll" is the story of a well-to-do young boy who has a crush on the girl next door, and he has been told by his mother that babies are born when two people kiss. After the fact, though; a selection of popular songs serves as an intermission before the next story, "The Vise," where a woman has committed adultery with her husband's best friend, and the merciless husband knows about it; the last episode revolves around the farcical trial of a woman for murdering her mother-in-law.

S&amp;man	2006	J.T. Petty	5.8	Elizabeth Cartier,Carol J. Clover,Debbie D	Rated R for sequences of strong disturbing horror violence and aberrant behavior including graphic dialogue, sexual content, nudity and language	
S&MAN begins with footage from Michael Powell's exploration of voyeurism, "Peeping Tom." Director JT Petty uses this footage as a starting point to examine the classic comparison between filmmaking and voyeurism, particularly within the horror genre. He goes on to investigate this connection further, but rather than looking to classic horror films, Petty explores the seedy underground genre of fetish films. These movies are basically simulated snuff films where victims are raped and murdered in a variety of fantasy scenarios. The most notorious of these is a series called "S&Man," where voyeurism takes center stage as people are unknowingly followed with a camera. Petty plunges headfirst into this world of bizarre fetish films, and comes up with mesmerizing interviews with the producers and actors of these movies. Much of the footage from these videos will shock and disturb even the most seasoned horror veteran. However, the connection that Petty draws between these films and ...

We Don't Live Here Anymore	2004	John Curran	6.4	Mark Ruffalo,Laura Dern,Peter Krause	AL	
The movie is set in the Pacific Northwest; specifically, Washington state. We know this from a glimpse of a license plate, the craftsman architecture of the two houses, and the mature, rich landscapes in between. The setting, like the scrutiny of the four main character's lives, is defined by the narrowness of the camera's field-of view. The one commercial street in town is only seen in the reflection of a store window, a shot of a non-descript auto-yard, or the tunnel of a tree-lined suburban sidewalk. The lush, wooded landscape is understood as an immediate presence in the domestic and professional lives of the characters; a steep hill, railroad tracks, a rushing stream, and a path over an old steel bridge are revisited again and again by the characters in their capacities as lovers, parents and friends.

A romance full of emotions, adventure and humor, the love of a lifetime is what the film is about. But between this boy and girl the story is not that simple. Although their bond is unbreakable they keep separating over the years. It's not circumstantial forces or even external pressures, but the very individuality of each is what keeps getting in the way in spite of all the love that's cherished within. In tracking their early zigzagged path the film delves into the complex and intricate web of inner conflicts that arise between young men and women of this age and ultimately innovatively poses the eternal question: Can Adam and Eve live happily ever after ?

A memorably bizarre screen version of Lewis Carroll's novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', mixing one live actor (Alice) with a large variety of stop-motion animated creatures, ranging from the complex (the White Rabbit) to the incredibly simple (the Caterpillar, consisting of a sock, a couple of glass eyes and a pair of false teeth). The original story is followed reasonably faithfully, though those familiar with this director's other films won't be the least bit surprised by the numerous digressions into Svankmajer territory, living slabs of meat and all. As the opening narration says, it's a film made for children... perhaps?                <em class="nobr">Written by

<a href="/keyword/alice-in-wonderland?ref_=tt_stry_kw"
> <span class="itemprop" itemprop="keywords">alice in wonderland	-	
A memorably bizarre screen version of Lewis Carroll's novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', mixing one live actor (Alice) with a large variety of stop-motion animated creatures, ranging from the complex (the White Rabbit) to the incredibly simple (the Caterpillar, consisting of a sock, a couple of glass eyes and a pair of false teeth). The original story is followed reasonably faithfully, though those familiar with this director's other films won't be the least bit surprised by the numerous digressions into Svankmajer territory, living slabs of meat and all. As the opening narration says, it's a film made for children... perhaps?

In 1976, a young woman in Krakow is making her diploma film, looking behind the scenes at the life of a 1950s bricklayer, Birkut, who was briefly a proletariat hero, at how that heroism was created, and what became of him.

A portrait of Birkut emerges: he believed in the workers' revolution, in building housing for all, and his very virtues were his undoing. Her hard-driving style and the content of the film unnerve her supervisor, who kills the project with the excuse she's over budget. Is there any way she can push the film to completion?

During the screeing of a sentimental Polish melodrama called "Daybreak" at the Liberty cinema across the road from the censor's office, the actors start to rebel and refuse to speak their lines. This is anarchy, and when the censor is unable to control the situation, senior party officials are called in. Eventually a film critic notes that the situation reminds of "The Purple Rose of Cairo" by Woody Allen and brings a reel of the film to demonstrate. The officials watch the film with amusement until another mix-up occurs: the second projector is turned on accidentally and superimposes "Daybreak" over "Purple Rose".

Hor B'Levana	1964	Uri Zohar	6.7	Arik Lavie,Shaike Ophir,Avraham Heffner	-	
A new immigrant, Tzelnik, arrives at the port of Jaffa. He goes to live in the Negev desert where he opens a kiosk in the middle of nowhere. Mizrachi comes along and opens a competing business across the way. The two make a living by selling to each other. As there is nothing there, they decide to create a world out of their imagination. They build a cardboard film set, which slowly takes on real dimensions- the buildings turn to concrete, people come to audition for parts in the "film" (cinema 'verite' style, with Zohar mocking viciously the pretensions of the "actresses") and builders come to void apartment buildings (mocking the glorification of concrete and "heroic" settlement). In one sequence, Arab actors come and ask the filmmakers turn positive to negative, and they're given the role of pioneers who plow the land and sing Zionist songs. The imagined world of the filmmakers becomes so real eventually they lose sight of the thin line between fantasy and reality.

At last filmmaker Otto Spalt wants to do what he has always dreamed of: the time has come to make his big feature film. There's just one little thing he still needs and that's the money. At the 189th board meeting of the Executive Committee for the Evaluation of Film Projects the combined expertise of a grotesque jury will decide Otto's future film. Will Otto manage to convince the panel of his artistic talent? Otto Spalt is relying wholly on the effects of his five short films, which he duly presents to the illustrious tribunal: a lavish production involving 5000 actors ("Phantom"), a sensitive melodrama addressing the question of the right direction in life ("Backwards"), a duel with the inherent violence of the flesh ("Meat Ball Pauli"), a breathtaking action-packed thriller ("Murder By Scissors") and a sizzling tale of espionage about micro- and potato-chips ("Close Up") are calculated to open the eyes and the purse of the Film Productions Committee.

'B' Girl Rhapsody	1952	James R. Connell	6.1	Lily Ayers,Crystal Starr,Chili Pepper	-	
A filmization of a typical burlesque shown offered from the stage of a Los Angeles theatre. The genre tag of "drama" does not apply as the only drama is whether Lili will shed all or not. (She doesn't.) It might, since there is no Burlesque genre, pass as a musical...until one hears the orchestra. Just another of a long line of "burlesque movies" shot on the cheap and sold to the bottom-of-the-barrel theatres which served to add a second meaning to the term "grind house." Some of the listed performers were still bumping-and-grinding in schlock pictures into the 70's and later.

In an effort to upset his ex-wife and her new leftist boyfriend, Giorgio, a man who has never had a political opinion of his own, has left Italy to embrace a new country and the politician his wife hates the most: George W. Bush. Ironically, in his recently adopted city, Giorgio finds himself surrounded by people who also hate Bush, and while he works in a deli and sleeps in its basement, he can only watch a TV that plays, exclusively, the messages of a "leftist" local station. Finally, Giorgio meets Laura, an admirer of the American president, and a relationship develops. He must now find a real place to stay, get a green card, and win the girl's heart on his way to achieving the American Dream. We follow Giorgio's journey through the twists of American politics in this unique, funny, heartwarming and extremely clever "dramady"

Tajna dvorca I.B.	1951	Milan Katic	8.2	Silvija Hercigonja,Gregor Radev,Milko Sparemblek	-	
'Tajna dvorca IB' is a balletic musical, dialogue-less, propaganda rendition of Cominterne's Resolution used by Stalin to regain his rule over non-Soviet communist countries, especially Tito's Yugoslavia. This film can be considered as one form of Tito's propaganda response to Stalin's demands. Set in a metaphorical state, it describes the alchemical creation of Resolution in a desolate castle where enslaved Communist leaders work under Stalin's command. When the Resolution, in shape of a young woman, is released to the public, workers and citizens despise her and she returns to its' creators, her fate showing them that Yugoslav people are against Stalin's rule. This film remains a curio even for the most knowledgeable connoisseurs of Yugoslav film.

The girl (Julia) belongs to a family of political fugitives from Peru. Adam and Julia immediately fall in great and reciprocal love, and there are highly emotional love scenes. Therefore Adam breaks with his group. But when his best friend is killed by Julia's brother, he kills the brother. In turn the couple is hunted by the police and Julia's relatives. Both Adam and Julia are finally murdered. The film takes no step toward reconciliation.

VITO AND THE OTHERS is the groundbreaking film which drew international attention to the problem of neglected youth and street crime in poverty-stricken Naples. The film's opening moments are startling and deeply disturbing. A despairing Rosario has just murdered his wife and daughter at the dinner table on New Year's Eve. Somehow, Vito quietly convinces his father to drop the gun, spare their lives and call the police. Placed in the custody of sexually abusive relatives, Vito is left free to roam the trash-strewn back streets of Naples where he and his friends engage in drug abuse, prostitution and petty crime. Ably acted by a large cast of nonprofessional street kids, VITO AND THE OTHERS is a heartrending portrait of innocents without a future.

This is the film within the film he sets out to make, "Ten Nights Bliss."

The video pitch is a remake of a film extract from Shock Corridor by Sam Fuller in 1963. In this extract a young black man is seen praising the 'KKK'. Colors in the video (B&W), are like a 'recipient' where we can find, put, different colors so peoples, communities. My intention through this work is to trigger some reflection about ' Intercommunity racism ', without crediting this work with moralizing. I trying not to be in the expected places, in front of some reality, situation, but trigger some debate by suggesting a different point of view, some other hypothesis.                	-

A movie director grows up amidst the glamour and chaos of Hollywood. All grown up he now strives to make a career out of his childhood dreams. As a young boy, his creativity began with the life changing movie "The Evil Sands of Time" (Starring the seventh time Academy Award winner Thomas Hank). After directing the most lucrative block buster in history, he becomes successful in the eyes of the world. However, he lacks respect in his professional, and personal life. On set, his childhood best friend is now a high and mighty award winning cinematographer who has become self-indulged. She sadistically terrorizes his every attempt to direct, and finish his movie. Stress and frustration give way to bad habits, and he continues to lose important people in his life. One drunken night, the director becomes infatuated with the idea of building himself an artificial friend who will defend him against the cruelty and injustice of the world. What he succeeds in creating is, D.P., The Ultimate ...

Iyer I.P.S.	2005	HariRajan	2005	Sanghavi,Satyaraj	-	
Sathyaraj in a dual role. One role is of an IPS officer (Iyer) and the other is of a dada (Venkatachalapathy). The dada throughout the film has a dark skin and sports a bald head. Iyer believes that dadas and rowdies must be eliminated through encounters. But his father thinks one does not have the right to take any life. Dada Venkatachalapthy plants bombs at various places in the city and puts the blame on Muslims. Iyer takes Venkatachalapathy into custody. His sons Pasupathi and Gajapathi try to kill Iyer. Now Iyer's father turns against him and joins the villain. This sets off a chain of events leading to murders. Satyaraj does both the roles of Iyer and Venkatachalapathy with maturity looking majestic in uniform. Sangavi as Iyer's wife appears in a brief seductive role. Anantharaj and O.A.K. Sunder (dada's sons) are adequate. Narayana Rao as Iyer's father ends up overacting, his voice being the main culprit. The director recently filmed a dance with black skinned Sathyaraj and ...

This independent Indian debut is a film whose story tells of the death of a loved one and takes its characters along a path which will ultimately enable them to grasp the meaning of human existence and the universe as a whole. The tormented protagonist searches for the meaning of life in books. In one that he buys in a bazaar, he finds a marked passage that paints a precise picture of his situation. The address of the book's previous owner is written inside and the hero sets out to find him. He turns out to be the equable owner of a restaurant situated on a sunny beach in the middle of a captivatingly serene bay, who tells him that he was not the one who marked the passage. The film follows the journey of the book and its role in the lives of several people, tracing the way in which human destinies are bound together in time and space. Like the dialogues which abound in healthy insight and light spontaneity, it sees the Frisbee as a symbol of meditative reflection and offers ...

Inspired by the book Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide by the husband-and-wife team Nick Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. A perspective of the opportunities that lie within the empowerment of women, examining the spectrum of attitudes held, and behaviours toward women from differing sexes and cultures. The narrative laments the various forms of oppression women globally experience, from the cruel and often violent characteristic of some developing regions, to a contemplation of the more implicit behaviors latent in Australian society. Blossoming from this moral challenge, the narrative develops to a consideration of the transforming powers held within the empowerment of women.

A young waiter finds the woman of his dreams, but she is beyond his reach. A young brat finds out that love does not have to be as complicated as her love-hate relationship with her mother. And a sexy lounge singer searches for the perfect man who will keep his promises and who will never leave her.

A Tel Aviv taxi breaks down, and while the driver attempts to repair it, the passengers take shelter and relate tales to each other. One man relates how he became a hero, in a comic fashion, while on Army maneuvers; an elderly woman tells of her first visit to the big city; another woman tells how she and her husband invited his boss and his wife to their home for dinner, with the intent of getting the husband a raise, and they wound up in a hospital thinking they had food poisoning. Another story concerns how the police caught a demented-thief who stole from a bank to give money to the poor.

Imagine it is summer and that, for the last several days, Montreal has been swimming in sweltering heat and smog. Then imagine that you are in the city's downtown core and a woman holding a small video camera approaches you. She asks you to participate in a one-question survey. Although you are slightly wary of this proposal, you stop to listen. She asks you: "What does happiness mean to you?" and awaits your answer. Go on! What are you waiting for? Answer! HAPPINESS IS A SAD SONG tells the disjointed story of Anne-Marie, an unemployed publicist pounding the pavement in Montreal with her mini-cam, collecting testimonials on the subject of happiness. It is happiness that she appears to seek, or understand to the point of being obsessed by her quest. Guided by serendipity and a series of surprising and varied encounters, Anne-Marie dives head-first into her project. She meets a medley of characters whom she engages in engrossing, thought-provoking discussions about happiness. Anne-Marie...

Una antica leggenda racconta che ogni notte, nel castello dei Sanguignoni, si aggiri il fantasma di un avo resosi autore di un atroce delitto nel Medio Evo. L'attuale proprietario del castello vuole chiarire i fatti ed incarica una agenzia di investigazioni di far luce sulla faccenda. Un poliziotto imbranato e poco accorto arriva al castello ed inizia le indagini, con metodi del tutto personali. Dopo una serie di avventure comiche ed un pò assurde, si viene a scoprire che una banda di falsari, a conoscenza delle dicerie sul castello, si era insediata nei sotterranei dello stesso e, per operare con tranquillità, provvedeva a far circolare la notte il pauroso fantasma. Alla fine i malviventi vengono assicurati alla giustizia e la serenità torna al castello.

C/O Butterfly - A Rhapsody of the Womb	2014	Joanne Cheng	2014	Wei Wen Chen,Joanne Cheng,Xiao Hua Shen	-	
In C/O BUTTERFLY, the viewer encounters an abortion, enters a womb, a cave, a stream-of-consciousness to meet two women at the crossroad both haunted by lives that could have been. PHOENIX, in her 40s and an unmarried writer, wants a child via IVF; BUTTERFLY, in her 20s, entangled with a man of power, aborts one. Viewers walk along the chilly interiors of the nightmares of the two women haunted by the spirit of the crushed fetus who lives on. The film is a eulogy of life lost. Defying genre conventions, C/O BUTTERFLY is a hybrid of styles of documentary, psycho drama and animation. Poetic and sometimes surreal, the film explores the core issues of human dilemma all associated with womb, the source of life.

Their reminiscences of the dying man and of their lives in Russia are punctuated by debates and squabbles: Whom did Alik love most? Should he be baptized before he dies, as his alcoholic wife, Nina, desperately wishes, or be reconciled to the faith of his birth by a rabbi who happens to be on hand? And what will be the meaning for them of the Yeltsin putsch, which is happening across the world in their long-lost Moscow but also right before their eyes on CNN?

All of a sudden, the performer of Desdemona falls ill. The local woman teacher plays in her stead. She makes a success and joins the troupe.

X-Scape	2011	Belinda M. Wilson	5.5	Temilola Akapo,Giovanni Avancena,Orin Bazillio	-	
Seven sociopaths escape from a maximum security prison. Immediately, the carnage begins: thief; rape; murder; and terror. Hiding from helicopters, and running in neighborhood woods, proves that no one is safe from these men! The fugitives elude cops and stalk the innocent as well as the not so innocent. They are tracked by the police, but one officer has a personal reason to kill one of the escapees. Mad Dog, the self appointed leader, terrorizes everyone, including the other fugitives. He foresees each of his rapes, seconds in advance through a distorted reality. He has no conscience and enjoys the pain he inflicts on others. Even celebrities are not out of his deadly reach. This is a fast, action packed, thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the time the film begins to the twisted end while an intense, pulsating, rap soundtrack lends to the suspense.

Through a series of interviews with them, supplemented by personal comments of critics, academics and collectors, the intention is to create a heterogeneous landscape, fragmented and unique at the same time, as the style of that Nespolo.

Director Fatma-Zohra Zamoum plays herself in this highly original and intriguing debut, interweaving a documentary-style account of her return to Algeria to shoot her film, employing members of her family along the way, with three mysterious, artfully-shot, fictional narratives. Alia, a photographer, is attempting to journey from Tunis to Constantine to see her sick father; Cherif, an aging writer, is grappling with the discovery of his own death via an announcement in the newspaper; their paths cross through Farid, the taxi driver, who guides them through a fraught Algerian landscape. Zamoun's stylish film heralds a significant new talent in Algerian cinema

Add to all this relative Ying Hua in affection for Lo Hong Shun, Hu Jiao sees a way to use the righteousness of the Ba family to help him kill the hero Lo by turning them against him - but will righteousness prevail?

A carpet shop, which has never had a single customer cross its threshold, is an ideal place to start a business.

Two stories are simultaneously told. One dutiful mother progressively becomes a frustrated woman who is the only one assuming the family responsibilities of working at home and looking after her only son, whereas her husband works all day, does not appreciate his wife's efforts and the only thing he does by the time he gets home is to read the newspaper and watch soccer matches. On the other hand, a female gymnast prepares for her last competition before her career retirement, but faces pressure from her trainer and a lack of motivation to keep going.

Muriel, a writer nearing 50 whose older lover won't live with her in Paris, meets a man on a train - Samuel, an Arab. He's attracted to her and pursues her, dropping in, asserting himself. She's willing to connect. He's passionate, then boorish, then jealous and possessive. He seems fixed on "Who's the strongest?," while she wants respect and trust. She's self-possessed as well as sexually charged, willing to laugh, and alternately firm and forgiving. He has little money, no immigration papers, few prospects, and a gambling jag. What does each want, and why does she stick with it? Is this colonial strife, war between the sexes, or a love story?

CAN U SEE IN 2 ME? is an experimental short film that explores the frustration of searching for a soul mate. With footage derived from a feature narrative, the fictional storyline is transformed to mirror the real life dilemma of the filmmaker. Where is this mythical soul? Are they concealed within a mysterious celestial landscape or are they an artificial construct of a mainstream media culture?

The film follows the lives of four upper-class teenage boys in Tashkent, Uzbekistan including the shy son of a famous film director, a chubby cut-up, son of a rich and successful businessman, and a tough aspiring playwright who works after school to avoid his raging alcoholic of a father. The four all live in the same housing complex and go to the same high school, where they fall for a beautiful, tough-as-nails new female student. Within the exotic locale of Uzbekistan, the boys experience the usual "growing pains" as they fall in love, "borrow" the family car, work hard to earn extra money and have too much to drink. A funny, touching slice-of-life comedy-drama.

Jsem devce s certem v tele	1933	Karl Anton	6.6	Lída Baarová,Frantisek Smolík,Ludvík Veverka	-	
This Czech sophisticated romantic comedy, filmed by director Anton also in a parallel French version ("Une petite femme dans le train"), casts beautiful Czech star Baarova in the role that Meg Lemonnier played in the Gallic version. Both versions seem to owe something to the sophisticated "continental" comedies of Lubitsch and, later, Korda, although Anton was not exactly in their league. It may be coincidence that the original Czech title of this film ("Jsem devce...") can be translated as "I'm a Girl with a Devil in the Flesh." Both Raymond Radiguet's French novel "Le diable au corps" and Garbo's famous MGM film, "Flesh and the Devil" (based on Radiguet's book), would have been well known in Czechoslovakia as well as France, before "Jsem devce..." was filmed. But the Radiguet & Garbo creations were very serious, while the Anton-Lemonnier-Baarova films were light and amusing. Pehaps no connection. (A Czech language web-site today displays a nice poster from the 1933 Czech film: "http...

It's no secret that people from the big city look at northern Florida as a backwaters filled with unpredictable and somewhat scary 'rednecks' packed into beat-up pickups drinking moonshine and waving Confederate flags. That's exactly how a New York modeling agent and his hot new client feel when their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, miles away from everything but a strange rundown motel and a dive bar ruled by loads of leering locals and a scary alligator hunter, one of the best movie rednecks to hit the screen. While the off-putting antics of the locals at first seems excusable, soon the wild experience takes a scary and sinister turn.                	-

"D*I*Y" (DO IT YOURSELF) is a coming-of-age teen drama set in Tucson Arizona about a teenage boy who starts his dream-business and embarks on an adventure for a new life. To save the foreclosure on his ill mother's house, he does everything in his power to transform his struggling company into a profitable enterprise.

Drinks and meals are suddenly on the house or paid for by an admiring person, usually a man, whose costumes, band, acting abilities or what have you, Stanley finds fascinating. He's actually Alan Conway (1934-1998): we watch him parlay a self-confident manner and a small amount of movie knowledge into a persona whom others immediately hang their dreams on. In exchange, Stanley asks only that they pay the bill. Will he be exposed? Do prosecution and prison await? Or has the National Health something else in mind?

Dagjesmensen	1950	Luciano Emmer	7.0	Anna Baldini,Vera Carmi,Emilio Cigoli	-	
E' domenica a Roma e chi può va a Ostia, al mare. Un gruppo di ragazzi in bicicletta; una famiglia numerosa e rumorosa con una vecchia auto; un vedovo che porta la figlia in colonia poichè la fidanzata non la vuole portare con loro in vacanza, in treno; Adriana, che ha lasciato Roberto per scrollarsi dalle spalle la povertà, con un auto lussuosa in compagnia di Donati. E chi resta in città: Ercole che fa il vigile urbano, in attesa delle carte per sposare la fidanzata incinta e licenziata per questo dai padroni; Roberto che trova cattive compagnie e si inguaia. Così si dipana una serie di storie parallele, tristi o allegre, e la sera, passata la domenica d'agosto, alcune cose anche importanti, saranno cambiate.

A second coming? This time our savior chose a shantytown outside Turin, in the north of Italy, overcrowded by poor families coming from the south in search of a job in a factory, or less legal ways to survive. Young Maria (Cinzia De Carolis) can predict the future during her epileptic seizures, or at least that's what everyone believes, and her mother (Clelia Matania) sells her predictions and responses to the superstitious neighbors, after inducing her "trance" with electricity. One night the shock is too strong, and Maria seems to die: when she wakes up, she is found pregnant. And being a honest unmarried girl from the south, she is obviously still virgin... Notwithstanding the opposition of the local priest (Turi Ferro), everyone, including her, believes in the miracle, and prepares for a second coming, in a crescendo of fanaticism that is soon noticed by the press, and by the official church..

Set in contemporary Naples, Dark Love focuses on the consequences of the brutal rape of a young woman by three teenage boys. Ciro is the only boy who shows remorse (he confesses his role, leading to recriminations from his fellow assailants), and part of the film is devoted to his experiences in an offshore juvenile prison. Simultaneously, the film follows the faltering efforts of the victim, Irene, to put her life back together, continue studying for university, and behave with some semblance of normality with her boyfriend and family. However, Ciro starts writing letters from prison to Irene, who eventually begins to read them. The two stories have a marked difference in tone. Ciro's experiences are unsurprisingly gritty and occasionally violent, while Irene, in a much more meditative depiction, is shown going about everyday life while still disturbed and alienated by what she has been through. The interweaving of the two stories is skillfully handled, the use of Naples as a setting...

"Life, Love, Death" was made before the abolition of capital punishment in France. Its central message is the inhumanity of the guillotine. The film, which is shot somewhat in a cinema verite style, divides roughly into three acts. In Act One, there is a series of murders of prostitutes in Paris. An obviously deeply disturbed man is hiring these prostitutes and then strangling them. Suspicion falls on François (Amidou), a married man with a child. The police put him under surveillance. (Viewers will recognize the inspector in charge of the team as Marcel Bozzuffi, who would play Popeye Doyle's nemesis in The French Connection a couple of years later.) Ironically, François is experiencing spiritual healing and renewal through the power of love---not with his wife, of course, this being a French film, but through an affair with a beautiful young woman he has met (not a prostitute). But just as this is happening and François seems to have lost the need to commit violent crimes, he is ...

Alex Grégoire is a timid insurance company clerk who shares his uneventful life between his wife Angèle, his colleagues and his passion for crosswords.

The heart of this dramatic story based on the novel by Leopold Lahola is the search for the principle of humanism. The story plays in a single day towards the end of World War II in a rough, snow-covered landscape where a German soldier escorts his prisoner with orders to shoot him. The background of the story is formed by the flashbacks of the partisan soldier being interrogated by a Russian commissar who wants to know all about him being taken prisoner. The German soldier Helmut Kampen escorts the captive partisan who is condemned to death but finally manages to flee. The commissar wants to know why the Germans did not kill him and accuses the partisan soldier of collaboration.

The Anonymous Rudy S.	2010	B.P. Paquette	2010	Tetchena Bellange,Marianne Farley,Leisa Reid	-	
Although police raided his apartment, the suspected stalker known as "The Anonymous Rudy S." was nowhere to be found. In fact, his very identity is still yet to be determined. Embarrassed authorities no longer believe that their only suspect ever actually lived in the apartment. Instead, they now believe he only used the apartment to video record his fan "letters", which he sent to his victim - local TV weather girl Melanie Sarah. For over a year, "The Anonymous Rudy S." bombarded her with dozens of his video "letters" in the hope of eventually winning her heart. Ironically, he always refers to himself as a "good stalker" and sees himself as quite different from other people who might indulge in this sort of criminal activity. Whether or not this is true, the courts will have the final say... if police ever apprehend their anonymous suspect. Until then, his video "letters" speak for themselves.

The stocks sell like hotcakes and things look rosey for the boys.

Seen through the eyes of Rebecca Gibbs, a young abuse victim, I DON'T WANNA FEEL NOTHIN' NO MORE is an intense drama that chronicles three generations of incest among the women in one family as they struggle to maintain their strength and dignity against almost overwhelming odds. After the arrest of her extended family on multiple sex abuse charges, the teen-aged Rebecca recalls the events of her family's tragic past that will lead to what the press has dubbed "The House of Horrors." Backtracking to 1956 when her Grandma Lila was first abused by her father, Rebecca recounts how her grandma tried to marry her way out of her plight only to find herself in a much more devastating trap that would last until her husband's death many years later. Rebecca then remembers how her mother Emily was made pregnant by her own father, only to have the baby die less than a year later, pushing Emily into a destructive cycle of abusive relationships, ending up with her cousin George, Rebecca's father. ...

Un buen día, Saturnino recibe el encargo de ir a Madrid a comprar un toro, y con dicho motivo se le conceden dos semanas de descanso en dicha ciudad, las cuales podrá aprovechar de la forma que más le apetezca. Lo primero que hace Saturnino al llegar a su apartamento es meterse en la cama a dormir, pero diversas peripecias le sacan de la cama y le llevan al Show de la elección de Miss España '74. Aparece ante las cámaras de TVE, y ante toda España, embutido en un traje de lentejuelas y besado ...

Mlad i zdrav kao ruza	1971	Jovan Jovanovic	7.3	Dragan Nikolic,Aleksandar Gavric,María Baxa	-	
A director with a very distinctive style, Jovan Jovanovic has filmed in 1971 one of the most significant works in the history of contemporary Serbian film. "Young and Healthy Like a Rose" is a strong visionary achievement that still looks topical today as back in the times when it was filmed and banned by the then communist censorship. A story about a young delinquent, who evolves from typical outsider to mafia boss of Belgrade seemed shocking back then; today, it is the cruel reality of our times. With incredible foresight of things to come, Jovanovic's leading character says: "I am your future". More poetical than Hollywood movies, much more realistic than "Trainspotting". An exciting story about crime, drugs and the deadly grip of the secret police in Serbia. The best role of Dragan Nikolic, one of the rare ones he presented himself as a tough guy and the authentic sex symbol from this region. A slap in the face of film and other convention. A must see!

Sejin's past record as a convict rids him of his individuality and his sister is on the brink of losing her job as a kindergarten teacher. The film questions what is true violence. The result, violence does not just include person to person, but can be silent brought on by a community that leads to a sacrifice of an individual. Such is the typical mechanism, murdering individuality through the violence of a group.
