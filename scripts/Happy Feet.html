    Distant STARS, with vast tracts of darkness stretching

<b>    A GREAT COMMUNITY

    EMPEROR PENGUINS all over the place, Its chaos - Grand

Norma J is having difficulty tearing herself away. Finally
she pads off after the others.

<b>THE DARKNESS
</b>
Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS
OF MALES are huddled, ice crusting on their feathers.

<b>                       MUMBLE (VO)
</b>             Tell me what it is about the cold and the
             dark. Soon as the sun goes away, everyone

The huddled penguins are engaged in ritual chanting

<b>                       LEAD VOICE

<b>                       MUMBLE (VO)
</b>             Caruso's the leader because he's so
             incredibly old. Some say more than 40,
             but you know how penguins exaggerate.

<b>OUTSIDE
</b>
WINDWARD PENGUINS peel off and walk around to the leeward
side. WISHFUL is among them

<b>                       CARUSO
</b>             ....Each one taking his turn to defy the
             wind.

<b>WIDE SHOT
</b>
The MASSED VOICES rise above the gale, the frosty plumes of
their breath forming a shared `thought bubble'...a benevolent
<b>ÜBERPENGUIN.
</b>
<b>                       CARUSO.
</b>             ...As we invoke the Great One, Penguin of

</b>             My dad was never that devout. Often his
             mind was on other stuff.

As the chanting builds, a little thought-bubble appears next
to the communal imagination: An image of Norma J

<b>                       NORMA J.

steam escapes

An egg rolls out of the HUDDLE and onto the ICE.

<b>                       WISHFUL
</b>             Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg!

WISHFUL barges out of the huddle, retrieves the egg and
waddles back into the warmth again.

Pulling back, till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned
out by the HOWLING GALE.

We are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the
Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts.

Louder and louder, until...

The CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the
sound of the gale, and, as if in response

<b>THE EARTH TURNS!
</b>
The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins
to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The
vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more.

<b>ON THE ICE SHELF
</b>
The ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing.

A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks
again.

The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at
the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs.

Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier
and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same
time...

<b>THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY
</b>
An EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like
<b>POPCORN.
</b>
Fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy CHICKS
emerge to greet the daylight.

<b>                          EXCITED FATHERS

WISHFUL staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet.

He taps the egg with his beak. Bending close they hear a
TAPPING SOUND in REPLY.

WISHFUL taps again. The tapping comes back louder. A TINY
FOOT pops out of the egg. Then ANOTHER. The Egg flips and
lurches off in a giddy DANCE.

are now performing with increasing virtuosity.

Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the
wind.

<b>THE EDGE

Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with
broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins
here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird.

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to
himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around
himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings
angrily..."There's no business like show business.

and then back out over the wasteland

Fade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off,
skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing
to his hearts content until....

a shadow passes over him and

Whump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel
flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him.

YELLOW PLASTIC BAND around the Skua's leg.

MUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the
unmistakable shape of a FISH. As he watches, the cloud morphs
into something that resembles a WHALE. Then morphs again
into...a SEAL. Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with
bulging eyes and tentacled hands.

Dozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTS...their coats almost fully moulted
to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers
underneath.

They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead
penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent

With solemn gravity, CARUSO throws his flippers into the air
and shouts.

Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents. In his adult
plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a
bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head
which has not yet moulted off.

GRADUATES have to cover to get to the sea.

Some are shuffling along on their feet; others are
tobogganing.

racing to catch up.

He lets go the fish and MUMBLE plummets downwards, landing

He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice.

He looks around - an unfamiliar landscape of ice - then over
the side, seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples.

A more VIOLENT NUDGE from behind almost makes him lose his
balance. A DARK SHAPE passes swiftly through the water.

<b>                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>             Saw you. Richard? Eddie? Ella....

The dark shape SHOOTS out of the water. Its GAPING JAWS
missing Mumble by an inch.

<b>                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>             ......aaarghH!

As he recoils, slips and tumbles into the WATER.

<b>UNDERWATER/ SURFACE
</b>
Choking, thrashing and gulping air, Mumble SCRAMBLES to get
back onto the ice.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             Everybody out!! LEOPARD SEAL!! (glub)

The murderous creature comes at him, jaws open, baring rows
of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life.

The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless, barging through smaller
floes, powering around larger ones.

Mumble just CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF. Desperate, he shoots up into
the air, landing on a THIN PANCAKE OF ICE that cannot support
his weight.

<b>                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)

...caught between the SOLID ICE above him and the bottomless
black WATER below.

Mumble POWERS ahead, the ice above growing thicker, the
angled ceiling forcing him down, deeper into the BLACKNESS.

The Leopard Seal opens its mouth. Its GAPING JAWS are about
to engulf Mumble when...

a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice. Mumble
makes a speedy sharp turn, climbing steeply.

He is in a FUNNEL OF ICE...getting narrower and narrower as it
rises to the surface. The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast.
MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air...

<b>THE ICE-SHELF
</b>
A small group of ADELIE PENGUINS recoil as MUMBLE explodes
out of the hole, closely followed by the LEOPARD SEAL.

WHAM! THUMP! They belly-flop on the ice .

Mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the Leopard Seal's
reach. The ADELIES TAUNT the bulky creature like matadors

it.

SEAL is almost upon them.

</b>             Or how about ...

MUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL
strikes. MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creature's face
comes down hard on the ice

the Adelies swoop and dive, corralling a FEW SMALL FISH into
a CREVICE.

The fish, darting to and fro are suddenly confronted by
Mumble's OPEN BEAK.

<b>ON THE ICE AGAIN
</b>
Mumble shares out the catch

As they shoot off the slippery-dip and into the sea mumble
whacks his head on the edge of the ice

The Adelies shoot back up to the surface. Mumble sinks,
slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the
surface recede.

Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of,
An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier.

It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem.

Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then
ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST.

<b>INSIDE THE BULLDOZER
</b>
A rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard.

He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the
sound it makes.

<b>OUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER

In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the ADELIES
congregate.

tracks.

The Adelies labour uphill into the wind. LOVEDAY is lagging

Even MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the
climb.

Music Over: He aint heavy he's my brother.

Not waiting, Mumble launches himself over the other side,
slip-sliding down the mountain. One by one the ADELIES
follow.

right over the top of them

on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their
good fortune.

Theres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them . Turning they
see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them
through the fog.

Already the ship is half a mile away.

<b>THE ICEBERG

Beyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLD'S TALLEST
ICEBERG. MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling
up its precipitous sides. THE ADELIES follow, struggling to
keep up.

MUMBLE's POV: THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about
a mile away. The Adelies join him.

<b>THE OPEN SEA

MUMBLE PLOUGHS THROUGH a rolling sea: towering waves block
everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of...

THREE BLACK SHIPS, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting
for him.

<b>LATER
</b>
He's getting closer. The ships are only half a mile away when
Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a
<b>HUGE NET, TEEMING WITH FISH.
</b>
Mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as.

UP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the
water and is winched on board.

As if in response the ship's ENGINES START UP again and the
sea around him erupts in churning foam.

Swamped by the wake, Mumble goes under. When he resurfaces,
THE SHIP is already on its way.

He takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit.

<b>OPEN OCEAN
</b>
The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS. There is no sign of the ship now,
nor of land.

MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest
and down into the deep dark valley below.

<b>LATER
</b>
The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the
water.

<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns
with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!!

A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a
few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.

<b>                         MUMBLE

The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "NO-O-O-O" which
the Albatross does not need to translate.

</b>          No way mate, he won't go anywhere near
          `em. And neither should you.

Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the
warnings.

He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards
the convergence.

The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches.

<b>                    ALBATROSS (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't say I didn't warn you

The ALBATROSS wheels away.

As MUMBLE fights on through the huge choppy waves, the
Whale's Wagnerian song booms out, EERIE and FORLORN.

<b>THE CONVERGENCE
</b>
We see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing
course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the
water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. MUMBLE
swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE.

<b>A VAST OCEAN
</b>
MUMBLE is a mere DOT now as the GREAT CURRENTS capture him
and sweep him away.

We pull back through the clouds until the very CURVATURE OF
THE EARTH is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight.

<b>SMALL POLLUTED BEACH
</b>
On the HIGH-WATER MARK, amongst the rubbish and the oil
slick, we see what looks like a dead animal. It is MUMBLE.

A creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches. Its small hand reaches
down and nudges him with a stick. MUMBLE moans and the
gumboots RUN AWAY, shouting something unintelligible.

With great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see
more. Sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he LOSES
<b>CONSCIOUSNESS.

<b>A WHITE ROOM

Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on
shelves line the walls.

MUMBLE, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. He
opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp.

There is movement around him. Voices whispering in an alien
tongue. A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil
from his feathers with detergent. MUMBLE squawks.

<b>                    MUMBLE (VO)

contents in the air.

administered.

<b>                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh no! Not the pointy thing!

Drowsy now, he is eased into a PADDED CAGE. The SCIENTISTS
close the lid, and secure it with straps.

something unusual about this place. A plump penguin waddles
by

She bangs on the glass in her excitement.

<b>PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Mumble, woken from his reverie, looks up and sees her looking
at him.

The little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet. Mumble looks
down, realizes what his feet are doing, looks up again.

</b>           You like that? Well how about this.

He does a more elaborate step. The Mother shouts in
disbelief. Various other specators come back and join her.

Mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed.

Theres a riot going on up there. People fighting to get a
view. Newspaper reporters, TV cameras.

The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back, giving
Mumble more space. Every specattor is focussed on him. Mumble
is focussed on the spectators.

him. Kerchunk.

on the horizon.

Mumble approaches the two sentries. The colony is much
diminished: only small groups scattered here and there.

A gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins. Caruso is
momentarily speechless.

A few adventurous souls begin to copy him, out of fear if
nothing else.

As they do so, the sky begins to darken. A strange whirling
