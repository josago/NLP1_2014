<b>               BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK
</b>
<b>               ESTABLISHING SHOT - BLACK ROCK - PART OF TOWN: FOCAL POINT: 
</b><b>               RAILROAD STATION
</b>
               abandoned, in an extreme state of dilapidation. The structure 
               is blistered by the resolute sun, the roof is weather-warped. 
               Dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the 
               foundation. Between the building and the tracks is a long, 
               somewhat narrow platform, its floorboards twisted by time, 
               termites and the elements. The match-board overhang of the 
               building, throwing some little shade to a portion of the 
               platform, sags and bellies. From the overhang is appended a 
               rectangular panel on which, in flaky paint, the town is 
               identified:

<b>               BLACK ROCK
</b>
               One of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the 
               other, cocking the sign irregularly.

               The railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon. Past 
               the town on each side stretches the ocean-like prairie, with 
               sand dunes rising and falling monotonously, shouldering each 
               other toward infinity. The morning sun lays over this 
               wasteland of the American Southwest, a gigantic yellow bruise 
               from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread 
               themselves over the poisoned sky.

               A small shack stands next to the station, separated from it 
               by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building, 
               as if for support. The words POSTAL TELEGRAPH are arced across 
               its dusty vitrine. An old straight-backed chair, reinforced 
               with twisted wire, is tilted against the north-west corner 
               of the shack. In it is Mr. Hastings, the postal telegraph 
               agent, a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity. He 
               sits there spinelessly, fingering a wart on his receding 
               chin and, once in a while, for variety, rubbing a knuckle 
               under his watery nose.

<b>               FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK
</b>
               The town is minute, dismal and forgotten, crouching in 
               isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects 
               a secondary dirt road. The twin strips of steel glisten in 
               the fierce sunlight, fencing the dreary plain from the false 
               fronts of the town. In b.g. is the bluff of a black stony 
               mountain. Against this ancient mass the houses of Black Rock's 
               single street*** (See map, P.2A) are scanty in number and 
               insignificant in architecture, a conglomerate paint-peeled 
               modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin 
               strips torn from signs.

               The town and the terrain surrounding it have, if nothing 
               else, the quality of inertia and immutibility -- nothing 
               moves, not even an insect; nothing breathes, not even the 
               wind. Town and terrain seem to be trapped, caught and held 
               forever in the sullen, abrasive earth.

</b>
               jarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert, its 
               diesel engines pounding. Its horn "WONKS" twice, blasting 
               the shatterable air.

<b>               FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK - ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
               Nothing is changed, nothing is altered. But look close and 
               you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily 
               across the dirt and dust of the single street. HOLD for a 
               beat, then MAIN TITLE appears. Between the ensuing credits 
               INTERCUT a series of sharp LONG SHOTS. The composition of 
               each shot has that hard, sun-beaten texture of American 
               primitive painting -- pressurized in its simplicity -- best 
               exemplified, perhaps, by the work of Grant Wood.

<b>               EXT. SAM'S SANITARY BAR AND GRILL - ANGLE ON DOC VELIE
</b>
               assayer and notary public, mortician to the citizens of Black 
               Rock who have departed to a better place, and veterinarian 
               to its lesser animals. An elderly, somewhat untidy gentleman, 
               he sits nonchalantly on a chair outside the Bar & Grill. 
               Idling with him are three or four other loafers, among them 
               Sam, the middle-aged proprietor of the restaurant. Doc glances 
               casually at his watch; no one else moves. The hot wind 
               continues listlessly down the empty street.

</b>
               A tall, attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton 
               shirt. She stands just outside the open barn-like door of 
               the garage, staring, from the compulsive force of habit, at 
               the endlessly receding tracks. The sultry wind, its gustiness 
               slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair.

<b>               EXT. PORCH OF HOTEL - COLEY TRIMBLE AND HECTOR DAVID
</b>
               two enormous men. HECTOR is tall, and there is about him a 
               nasty, raw-boned tautness; COLEY is more the anthropoid type -- 
               long thick arms and a round, iron casing of a belly. They 
               glance down the street, watching incuriously a dust devil 
               swirling in the wind.

               Now the CAMERA has completed its probe of the town and its 
               denizens. MAIN TITLE and CREDITS are completed...

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - MR. HASTINGS
</b>
               still spineless in his chair, the chair still tilted against 
               the shack. From o.s. and far away, we hear the horn of the 
               streamliner -- two long "WONKS", a short and a long (engine 
               whistle signal for approach to bridge crossing). Hastings 
               straightens up ever so slightly as he reacts to the oncoming 
               train.

<b>               STRAIGHT SHOT - STREAMLINER
</b>
               moving at tremendous speed.

<b>               BRIDGE
</b>
               with train barrelling toward it. The horn BLASTS -- three 
               short WONKS (engine whistle signal for stopping at next 
               station).

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS
</b>
               getting jerkily to his feet, as though charged by a galvanic 
               current. The uncharacteristic speed of his movements throws 
               the tilted chair to the station platform. He raises an arm 
               to shield his watery eyes from the sun...

<b>                                     HASTINGS
</b>                              (almost inaudible, as 
                              if to himself)
                         Stopping...?

<b>               SHOT - TRAIN
</b>
               heading toward CAMERA, churning across the desert like a 
               juggernaut. It PANS past CAMERA in a blur of speed. CAMERA 
               SWINGS UP on a level with the great iron wheels as the brakes 
               are applied. The wheels shriek agonizingly against the rails, 
               kicking up cinders and a wild flurry of dust. She cuts speed, 
               brakes hissing, and starts to slow down.

<b>               LONG SHOT MAIN STREET - BLACK ROCK
</b>
               SHOOTING from rear of town, toward the railroad tracks. The 
               townspeople step out, frowning, cautious, disturbed. The 
               secure ritual of the train passing through, never stopping, 
               has somehow, for some unknown reason, been violated.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - DOC VELIE
</b>
               as his mouth tightens. His air of placidity vanishes, leaving 
               his features disturbed.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - LIZ BROOKS
</b>
               Her fine young face stiffens almost imperceptibly. Her eyes 
               are coated with a vague emptiness. She seems confused as she 
               halfturns toward the hotel.

<b>               REVERSE SHOT - WHAT SHE SEES
</b>
               Coley Trimble and Hector David, standing on the porch of the 
               hotel. They seem tense, responding variously to what might 
               be fear. Coley's nostrils flare, his flat ugly mouth 
               compresses. He looks profoundly serious. Hector wipes a glob 
               of dusty sweat from the socket of an eye and blinks rapidly.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS
</b>
               as he stands in surprise, nervously alert, watching the train 
               as it comes to a complete stop. His jaw droops with the 
               slackness of fear.

<b>               EXT. STATION PLATFORM
</b>
               with the train stationary before it. A sleek steel door of a 
               pullman clangs open. A colored porter carrying a suitcase 
               walks down the wrought-iron steps. He is stately, gray-haired 
               and lean, with the almost finical tidiness travelers associate 
               with trainmen. The man behind him is big-shouldered, a granite-
               like wedge of a man with calm, piercing eyes. There is about 
               him an air of monumental dependability and quiet humor, but 
               his eyes are those of a man who has lately lived in somber 
               familiarity with pain. His left arm hangs from his shoulder 
               with that lifeless rigidity of paralysis, while the hand is 
               hidden in his pocket.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY AND PORTER
</b>
               The porter puts the suitcase on the platform. In the distance 
               the town and its people are seen staring silently, 
               motionlessly. The big man glances toward them. He smiles a 
               sad, distasteful greeting to the town, its wretched dust. 
               its mean, modest buildings. The porter disappears into the 
               train as the conductor enters scene. He turns slowly, 
               following Macreedy's gaze...

<b>                                     CONDUCTOR
</b>                              (softly, staring at 
                              the towns people)
                         Man. They look woebegone and far 
                         away.

<b>                                     MACREEDY
</b>                              (looking around)
                         I'll only be here twenty-four hours.

<b>                                     CONDUCTOR
</b>                         In a place like this, it could be a 
                         lifetime.
                              (turning to face 
                              Macreedy)
                         Good luck, Mr. Macreedy.

               Macreedy nods his thanks. The conductor signals the engineer 
               (o.s.) and steps on the train. The diesel's claxon blasts 
               the torrid air ominously. The train slowly, smoothly, begins 
               to move, picking up speed. The cars slip past until, quite 
               suddenly, the Streamliner is gone. For a moment Macreedy 
               watches it. Then, quite unconsciously, he takes a package of 
               cigarettes from his left hand pocket, taps the last one free 
               of the pack, sticks it between his lips and, crumpling the 
               empty pack, drops it beside the tracks. He takes a cardboard 
               book of matches, flicks it open, bends a match in half with 
               agile fingers, and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the 
               head against the sandpaper guard. The match flares, the 
               cigarette is lit. Macreedy inhales, exhales deeply, and turns 
               to pick up his suitcase. Then he sees Hastings, who walks 
               slowly, almost painfully, to him. His Adam's apple grapples 
               protestingly with his collar. After a moment he controls it 
               sufficiently to talk...

                         Hastings, the telegraph agent. Nobody 
                         told me the train was stopping.

               With his suitcase, he cuts across a weedy path, running into 
               Black Rock's single street. For a moment, Hastings stares 
               after him; then he breaks hurriedly, entering telegraph 
               agent's shack.

               stranger.

               The hollow rasp of Macreedy's tread on the wooden platform 
               of the "pavement" seems shatteringly loud in the enveloping 
               silence...

<b>               CLOSE ANGLE - ON MACREEDY
</b>
               as he walks along. He feels the eyes of everyone following 
               him, glaring at him. He halts, looks around. The townspeople 
               continue to eye him brazenly, yet with an almost animal 
               incuriosity. He grins and walks on past a cluster of five or 
               six RFD mail boxes and a road sign [1], its paint peeling, 
               its face punctured by three or four bullets from a drunk's 
               pistol long ago.

<b>               SHOT - MACREEDY
</b>
               heading toward the hotel. In b.g. is a relatively small farm 
               equipment yard compressed between a general store (which 
               Macreedy has just passed) and the hotel just ahead. In the 
               yard are a few tractors, and among them huddles a tiny office. 
               It is empty; the front window is thick with dust. On it, 
               etched by an anonymous, childish finger, is a skull and 
               crossbones. Running diagonally across is the printed legend:

<b>               T.J. HATES J.S.
</b>
               Macreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement. 
               He walks on, reaching the facade of the weather-beaten hotel. 
               A gust of wind swirls down the street, momentarily engulfing 
               Macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool. 
               As it subsides...

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY
</b>
               As he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel. It has 
               a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side. Macreedy 
               mounts the hotel steps. At the top of the steps Coley Trimble 
               and Hector David watch him silently. Hector is large and 
               leanly muscular, yet Coley looms over him like a battleship. 
               He is a gross behemoth of a man, with sharp flinty eyes the 
               size of glistening pinpoints and a slack, oversized jaw. 
               Both men wear modern Western work clothes, but there is one 
               incongruous accessory which Hector affects. Around his thick 
               wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately 
               tooled leather strap -- a cheap reproduction of one of those 
               expensive Swiss timepieces which, among many distinguished 
               accomplishments, tells the day of the week, the month of the 
               year, the phase of the moon, etc., etc.

               No reaction from Hector.

                         me.

               He brushes past Coley and enters.

<b>               INT. HOTEL
</b>
               It is a typical small town hotel, but crummier, with a tiny 
               lobby. Macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as Hector strolls 
               in, flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair. 
               He picks up a newspaper, but his eyes remain on Macreedy. 
               Macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk. For a moment, 
               he studies the open registration ledger; his eyes rove from 
               the ink-splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those 
               World War II banners, the imitation silk now stained and 
               faded. It depicts a shrieking eagle rampant, clutching The 
               Flag in a claw. Under it, the legend:

<b>                                   "GOD BLESS AMERICA"
</b>
               Near it, a tacky placard proclaims:

<b>               DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN, 
</b><b>               BY ALL THE MEANS YOU CAN, 
</b><b>               IN ALL THE WAYS YOU CAN,

</b><b>               AS LONG AS EVER YOU CAN.
</b>
               Feeling the eyes of Hector on him, Macreedy turns. Hector 
               meets his gaze with bland, insolent interest. Now a young 
               man (his name is PETE) comes out of a small room behind the 
               registration desk and walks up to it. There is a softness 
               about his regular features, a certain indefinable sugariness 
               about his mouth. He seems tight-lipped, for lorn and uneasy 
               as he faces Macreedy across the counter.

                         This is 1945, mister. There's been a 
                         war on.

               Macreedy looks at the young man with impeccable tolerance. 
               Without shifting his gaze, he slowly lets fall his small 
               suitcase. It thuds softly on the frayed carpet.

</b>                         Yeah, but the O.P.A. lingers on.

               Macreedy looks down at the open ledger on the desk before 
               him. The clerk reaches out to close it. Gently, yet firmly, 
               Macreedy stops him, reopening the big book. He studies it, a 
               finger straying unconsciously inside his collar. He [...] on 
               it to relieve the starchy stiffness.

               Pete begins to fidget...

               draws a safety razor down his face, completing his shave; 
               then he wipes a hand over the mirror, which clouds with steam 
               almost as fast as he can clear it. o.s., the SOUND of bath 
               water gurgling down the tub drain. He runs a tentative finger 
               inside the collar of his robe, pulling loose a price tag. He 
               drops it carefully into a wastebasket. He turns on the faucet 
               at the sink to rinse his shaving brush. The rusty pipes cough 
               and rumble, roaring as a trickle of water arrives while the 
               drain sucks loudly at its departure. He dries the razor, 
               turns off the faucet and exits.

               and slippers; a large towel is draped over his head, like a 
               prize fighter. He stops outside a door, pushes the towel 
               from his head to his neck and puts his hand on the knob. He 
               is about to insert the key when he tenses. Slowly, silently,

               Hector David, his gigantic body straining the springs. He 
               lies on his back, hands clasped easily under his head, thick 
               legs crossed, his Stetson tilted over his low forehead. He

               Slowly, his eyes still on Macreedy, Hector takes off his 
               elaborate wrist watch and slides it gently into his pants 
               pocket.

               Macreedy pauses and takes in the situation. He refuses to be 
               baited.

               He is about to dart behind the partition when...

               He walks to the desk, smiling at Pete. In b.g., Doc, Sam and 
               the loafers watch.

               Pete studies him, then bends under the counter, coming up 
               with a pack. Doc leaves Sam and is slowly walking toward the 
               stranger, eyeing him curiously.

               Macreedy throws the money on the desk and opens the pack, 
               dexterously using the fingers of his left hand.

               Macreedy looks at him, inhales deeply on his cigarette then, 
               as he slowly lets the smoke out, removes the cigarette and 
               looks at it.

               Now Doc is at the desk not far from Macreedy. Macreedy starts 
               out, then turns to Pete.

               Macreedy pauses, looking at Doc, who blandly returns his 
               stare.

<b>                                     MACREEDY

               Doc nods. Macreedy smiles and walks toward the door; Pete, 
               Doc et al watching him. He goes out.

<b>               EXT. STREET
</b>
               As Macreedy walks down hotel steps, a station wagon pulls up 
               just before him. Tied with a rope to the right front fender 
               is a magnificent eight-point buck. A stain of dry blood weaves 
               an uneven course down his glossy flank from an unmistakable 
               bullet hole in his shoulder. Two men get out of the car; one 
               of them is Coley Trimble. He sees Macreedy coming toward 
               him. He stands motionless in the center of the narrow 
               pavement, picking at his nose with the detachment of a child. 
               The other man is broad and excessively masculine as he swings 
               out from behind the wheel. He walks around the car, joining 
               Coley at the curb. Macreedy comes on. The man with Coley 
               looks at the stranger with colossal indifference, as 
               expressionless as the soil of Black Rock. His handsome face, 
               under a dusty hunting cap, is taut and hard and wind-shaven. 
               Next to Coley he stands motionless, except for the wisp of 
               smoke from a black Cuban cigarette between his thin lips. In 
               b.g., the loafers who had been ensconced in the hotel lobby 
               move out the door and stand on the porch. They watch Macreedy, 
               Coley and Reno Smith, the handsome, taut-faced man. Silence 
               soems to settle over everything. It is Macreedy who breaks 
               it...

                         Here we go again.

               Gently he walks around Coley and Reno Smith and continues 
               down the street. Coley's eyes follow him. Smith goes up the 
               steps of the hotel and enters the lobby. Coley quickly follows 
               him. The loafers on the porch go back inside.

               The loafers resume their familiar places as Smith walks 
               briskly to the clerk's desk. Pete, in anticipation, opens 
               the hotel register, places it before Smith

               Smith doesn't answer; he looks up thoughtfully. His eyes 
               harden almost imperceptibly as he sees Coley, across the 
               narrow room, looking out the window after Macreedy.

               Coley sits in the nearest chair. Beyond Smith, still resting 
               easily against the high counter of Pete's desk, the gigantic 
               figure of Hector appears at the top of the stairs. He comes 
               down and joins Smith.

               He hesitates as Doc Velie sidles amiably into earshot.

               Macreedy, down the end of the block, saunters easily up to 
               Liz's garage.

<b>               EXT. LIZ'S GARAGE - FULL SHOT
</b>
               The garage, without a door, opens on the street. Against the 
               front of the building is parked a battered bicycle. On one 
               of the barnlike walls a boy of nine is drawing laboriously 
               with a piece of chalk. He puts the last flourish to a skull 
               and crossbones identical with that seen earlier on the window 
               of the equipment yard office. Macreedy stops a few feet from 
               him, waiting until the boy prints "T.J.". As he steps back 
               to admire his handiwork...

               T.J. nods. He approaches the wall, raising his chalk.

               He pauses. As Macreedy opens his mouth to interrogate 
               further...

               Again a pause. T.J. has just completed the final letter of 
               the word "HATES". And again as Macreedy opens his mouth...

               Again the pause. T.J. steps back, having completed his work, 
               which, of course, broadcasts the fact that "T.J. HATES J.S.". 
               And again as Macreedy begins to speak...

                         Thanks.

               T.J. turns, pulls the bike away from the building, completes 
               a fastidious "pony express" and peddles furiously out of 
               scene.

               as Macreedy, after a moment's hesitation, starts down it. 
               From the far end, at the telegraph agent's shack, a figure 
               starts running toward Macreedy. It is Hastings. INTERCUT 
               between the two men. Hastings, in his concentration, doesn't 
               see the stranger until he is almost upon him. He slows down, 
               suddenly, awkwardly, to a self-conscious walk. Macreedy grins 
               at him, passes on, shaking his head speculatively. Hastings, 
               with a parting glance, gallops up the hotel steps.

               Smith, Coley, Hector, Pete, Doc, Sam et al are still in 
               evidence. Smith is in a tight little group at the desk with 
               Coley, Hector and Pete. Doc has taken a position at the 
               window, looking out. Hastings bursts in and half-runs to 
               Smith...

               Smith ignores him, thinking. Hastings breathes heavily.

               Smith staring out the window with a frown. Doc watching him 
               out of the corner of his eye, a bemused expression crossing

               ANGLE on Macreedy as he enters the jail. It is small and 
               dirty, with only a tired desk, two chairs and the usual police 
               posters on the wall. One side leads to the cell block and

               ANGLE from interior of cell block comprising two cells, both 
               of which are open. A man is asleep in the lower bunk of the 
               front cell. The keys are in the lock. Macreedy shakes his 
               head and starts to close the creaking cell door. Sheriff TIM 
               HORN, the man in the bunk, lifts his head, blinking his bleary

               wheel, cuts the engine and jumps out. Smith ambles silently 
               to a wall and leans against it. Liz reaches behind the 
               driver's seat and hoists, with both hands and some effort, a 
               five-gallon drum of axle grease from the floor of the jeep. 
               As she rests it on the rear fender...

               The girl looks at Smith, who has made no attempt to help 
               her.

               She lifts the drum to the ground.

               Liz hesitates. Macreedy notes her confusion as her eyes seek 
               Smith's for instructions. Quickly he moves in...

               Macreedy hands her a bill. She fumbles with it, not knowing 
               what else to do. Her eyes drift to Macreedy's stiff arm...

               He steps into jeep and, with one hand expertly manipulating

               For a moment Smith doesn't answer. Instead, with a half frown, 
               he lifts the bill Macreedy had given her from Liz's hand.

               in the wreckage. The remains of an iron bed. The burned-out 
               shell of a pick-up truck. Part of a stove. A morass of

               halts momentarily beside the well. Reaching out he touches 
               the warped sun-beaten boards that cover the mouth. He removes 
               one, and, picking up a pebble, drops it through the opening. 
               There is a long beat and then, from far, far below we HEAR a 
               faint PLUNK (o.s.). He replaces the board and walks to a

               The frame falls to the ground, leaving an un-scorched square 
               on the surface of the wall. He goes past a solitary standing 
               stone chimney. Suddenly he halts, arrested by something among

               CAMERA RISES, TILTING UPWARD to a cliff far away and shielded

               as it winds along a road with the cliff rising on one side 
               and falling off steeply on the other. He rounds a curve, 
               passes an insignificant side road, drives on.

               a straightaway, cutting through rocky outcroppings on both

               Packard.

               For the first time he is aware that he is being followed, 
               and that the man at the wheel of the big Packard is Coley.

               proceeding over a series of turns, inclines, declivities 
               (according to location terrain). Engines roar, brakes whinny, 
               tires scream, skidding on the turns.

               as Coley overtakes Macreedy. He steers the big car within a 
               foot or two of the jeep. The terrain has steepened; on the 
               right there is nothing between the road and the valley floor 
               far below but a few inches of soft shoulder.

               As Macreedy pulls wide on a razor turn, Coley tries to come 
               inside him. Macreedy, fighting for control of the veering 
               jeep, succeeds in cutting him off.

<b>               CURVE IN ROAD
</b>
               In the approach, Coley cuts sharp into the jeep. The jeep 
               seems to roll with the blow, then leaps ahead, maneuvering 
               the turn.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT COLEY IN CAR (PROCESS)
</b>
               Coley is flustered, his face blood-shot with fury. He seems 
               to generate an atmosphere of vicious, cruel craziness; the 
               wild smile across his mouth is almost sensual, obscene. He 
               floorboards the Packard. Like some monstrous battering ram, 
               the heavy car smashes into the jeep's rear bumper, kicking 
               the smaller vehicle jerkily ahead. Coley floorboards the gas 
               pedal, again. Each time he slams into the jeep with sickening 
               force, with the brutal abrasion of metal pounding metal.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - MACREEDY - (PROCESS)
</b>
               With one arm he works frantically to keep his under-sized 
               car on the twisty road. He sees ahead a precipitous cliff 
               falling off on an impossibly sharp curve. He makes a 
               decision...

               Just ahead the gradient is comparatively gradual, however 
               steep by normal standards. He swings the jeep off the road, 
               onto the declivity. The car plunges downward, miraculously 
               upright. Macreedy jockeys it to a whirring, shuddering halt 
               in the soft sand at the bottom of a draw.

               Macreedy turns slightly and looks up the mountain-side with 
               the road at its summit...

               standing at the edge of the road, peering down at him. In

               drives off.

</b>
               His face is caked with the sweat of his exertions and dust 
               kicked up by the grinding wheels. He exhales heavily and 
               runs a shaky hand across the side of his head. He becomes 
               aware suddenly of a NOISE, a trickling, an unmistakable tinkle 
               as of running water. He frowns, opens the jeep door...

<b>               MEDIUM SHOT - JEEP 
</b>
               as Macreedy unlatches the hood and throws it open. The NOISE 
               continues. Macreedy examines the engine and finds the

               focal point: the nut joining the gas line with the carburetor 
               has worked loose in the jouncing the car has taken. With his 
               hand Macreedy screws it tight.

<b>               MEDIUM SHOT - JEEP

               as Macreedy lowers the hood, re-enters jeep. He turns on

               Macreedy slowly driving the jeep toward Liz's garage. He

               Standing on the porch of the hotel, watching. Smith's face 
               compresses, and his eyes swivel to rest on Coley's with cold, 
               contemptuous anger. Coley licks his lips uneasily. Smith

               Macreedy is about to go up the steps when he sees Coley's 
               car at the curb. Both right fenders are creased. An ugly, 
               jagged break has split the front bumper almost in half, one 
               part angling crazily toward the sky, the other drooping in 
               the dust of the road. Smith and Coley come out of the hotel. 
               They stand on the porch, watching Macreedy as he in turn 
               watches the car. They exchange a glance. Smith nods, so...

               glances up at Smith, grinning with self-satisfaction, like a

               long massive body wedged against the wall like an unkempt

               jammed, not with volumes, but with the jugs and jars, the 
               chemicals and unguents of Doc's multiple callings. In a corner 
               three or four neat pine boxes are stacked one on the other.

               Doc sits at a cluttered desk feeding a large bowl of goldfish 
               and sipping a glass of milk. He looks up as Macreedy enters.

               An old-fashioned hearse, with plate glass sides and elaborate 
               lead candelabra -- Doc's "limousine" -- is parked a few steps 
               from the door. Macreedy climbs in behind the wheel as Doc 
               comes out and stands on the small back porch.

               Macreedy turns on the ignition switch. His foot kicks over 
               the starter, but the spark doesn't catch. He tries again, 
               then again. He pauses, frowns, as Doc comes down from the 
               porch and joins him.

               Again he presses the ignition switch. Nothing. And suddenly, 
               in b.g., the great bulk of Hector David looms up, leaning 
               against the porch pillar at the corner of the alleyway. His 
               expression is almost dreamy. For a moment he stands there 
               while Macreedy toys with the ignition and the sick engine 
               wheezes and grinds. Then he ambles up to the hearse...

               Macreedy takes the cigarette, lighting a match with one hand. 
               He puts the fire to Doc's smoke and then lights his own. He 
               inhales, exhales, thinking. Finally...

               Macreedy gets out of the car. Hector has already opened the 
               hood. Doc peers nervously over his shoulder. As they study 
               the engine, Hector's horsey face appears behind them. He 
               gestures toward the engine.

               Ignoring Hector, he bends over the engine, controlling his 
               obvious awareness that Hector has fouled up the ignition.

               Hector's eyes go hard. He reaches out suddenly, one great 
               hand closing over the distributor cap. He yanks, ripping the 
               feed wires out of their sockets.

               Still gripping the wires, he walks off. Doc simmers down. He 
               turns to face Macreedy, who hasn't moved. Now Macreedy slowly

               A few loafers are at the bar, draped bonelessly on high 
               stools. There is the usual array of bottles and glasses 
               aligned before a cracked, discolored mirror. In the corner 
               is a jukebox. Along the opposite wall is a line of low stools 
               facing a counter covered with oil-cloth thumb-tacked in place. 
               Behind it is a greasy hot plate and a couple of soiled 
               displays -- breakfast food, soft drinks, etc. At the grill 
               counter is Sam, cleaning his finger-nails with a toothpick. 
               At the bar, engaged in a worrisome conversation, are four 
               loafers, FRANKLIN KROOL, WALT MURTRY, RON BENTHAM and STERLING

               Sam is still working on his finger nails. He evidences little 
               interest in the stranger, but at the bar in b.g. the loafers 
               stiffen. Macreedy takes a stool in front of Sam.

               The door of the Bar & Grill opens. Smith and Coley enter. 
               They walk to Macreedy, stopping just a few feet behind him.

               He turns again as Sam plops an unseasonable mess of chili in 
               front of him.

               He gets up, with his chili, and sits down three stools away. 
               Coley straddles the stool Macreedy has vacated. He squirms 
               on it, his movements exaggerated. Now he spins to face Smith.

               Coley opens his mouth but, realizing he has been 
               outmaneuvered, closes it again. The loafers in b.g. are 
               silent, watching. Sam, seemingly oblivious to Coley's pressure 
               on Macreedy, places a bottle of ketchup in front of the 
               stranger. Coley gets up slowly and walks stiff-legged to 
               Macreedy. He takes the bottle of ketchup and, without removing 
               the cap, upends it over Macreedy's plate. The cap is drowned 
               in a deluge of ketchup which overflows the plate and runs 
               onto the counter.

               Macreedy rises to go out. As he passes Coley, Coley takes 
               his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around. 
               The two men face each other.

<b>                                     COLEY
</b>                         If I tied both hands...?

               Macreedy shakes free of Coley's grasp. Coley lunges. His big 
               right fist streaks toward Macreedy's face. Macreedy ducks, 
               weaving with the punch. He grabs Coley's belt, twisting 
               Coley's body. The momentum of the swing throws Coley off 
               balance. As he goes past Macreedy, the stranger tugs at his 
               belt, twisting him to one side. He plants his left foot firmly 
               on the toes of Coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring 
               Coley in place. He chops the under side of his open hand in 
               a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under Coley's ear. 
               With the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard 
               against and slightly under the tip of Coley's nose. The 
               cartilage shatters. Blood spills down his face. Following 
               through, Macreedy's elbow smashes beneath Coley's cheekbone. 
               Macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind-burned face, 
               finding Coley's right wrist. He jerks the wrist out and 
               backward. It snaps. Coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain 
               and perplexity. His body lolls forward. Macreedy steps back. 
               He raises his right shoulder a few inches. His bent right 
               arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift. 
               Fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber 
               shoulder giving them motion. The fist strikes Coley's face, 
               covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of 
               his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone. Coley shuts his 
               eyes and falls unconscious.

               Smith, a puzzled expression on his face, watches Coley fall. 
               He takes half a step toward him. Macreedy looks at Smith. 
               Smith stops. Macreedy's face is wooden, with a trace of 
               sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth. Working 
               methodically, Macreedy frisks Coley. He takes from a pocket 
               a long, ugly knife. He snaps the spring and the four-inch 
               blade leaps into place. He looks at the knife in his hand 
               and then at Smith. He smiles gently, even dreamily.

                         Wouldn't it be easier if you just

                         Or are there too many witnesses 
                         present?

               Macreedy walks slowly toward him, holding the knife. The are 
               only three feet apart. Smith's hand goes to a pocket, closes 
               inside over the outline of a pistol. Sam glances from Macreedy 
               to Smith to the unconscious Coley. He sidles toward the door 
               and runs out fast. (NOTE: From this point to end of scene

                         Something to use when things get 
                         tough.

               With a quick motion, he tosses the knife to Smith. Smith 
               catches it.

                         minute.

               He walks past Smith and goes out the door. Self-consciously 
               holding the knife, Smith turns to face the loafers at the 
               bar. They say nothing; they stare at him, through him, like 
               a panel of ghouls. The door opens, admitting Sam and Doc, 
               who carries his little black medical bag. Doc looks at Coley.

                         Man... man-oh-man.

               He goes to Coley, bending down over him. Smith has remained 
               motionless as a monument. Now he doubles shut the knife in 
               his hand. He pockets it, and without even glancing at Coley, 
               turns quickly and goes out.

<b>               INT. HOTEL LOBBY
</b>
               Doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the chairs. 
               He stares fiercely across the room at Smith who is on the 
               couch, reading a neatly folded newspaper. Behind him at the 
               clerk's desk, Pete is fitfully involved in a game of 
               solitaire. At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring change 
               into a slot machine. It whines, grinds, and clicks with 
               rhythmic monotony, but it never seems to pay off. In the 
               chair nearest Doc is Tim, with one of his boots off. He works 
               hard and with some concentration, removing the other. Then 
               he places them neatly at the foot of his chair. He wiggles 
               his toes -- watching them with some interest.

               The wheeze and whir of the slot machine stops. The sudden 
               silence turns the eyes of the men toward Hector and the one-
               arm bandit. They follow his gaze up the steps.

               walks down, carrying his suitcase. He goes to Pete at the 
               clerk's desk.

                              cards)
                         Nothing.

               As Macreedy turns from the desk, Doc joins him.

                         I'm truly sorry to say.

               Smith coolly continues to read his paper. It is Hector who 
               turns toward Doc...

               Macreedy ignores the exchange of words. He walks across the 
               frayed carpet to the nearest chair and drops into it. Doc, 
               who has followed him, stands looking down at Macreedy for a

               Doc follows his gaze as Hastings enters the lobby and looks 
               around. He sees Macreedy coming toward him. He walks rigidly 
               in an arc past Macreedy to Smith. He holds out a Postal 
               Telegraph form. Smith puts down his paper and takes it. 
               Macreedy, followed by Doc, goes over to Smith. Tim in his 
               stockinged feet joins them.

               Smith scans the message. He looks up to meet Macreedy's gaze. 
               Smith rises. Hector swaggers over from the slot machine. 
               Hastings slips around the back of the couch, protected by 
               the barricade of Hector's great body.

               Hastings is silent. A brittle expression of bemusement crosses 
               Smith's features.

                         Come on, Hector.

               He walks out, the new Sheriff strutting beside him, with 
               Hastings in their wake. For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Tim 
               stand in the center of the lobby. Pete eyes them non-
               committally and goes back to his solitaire. He glances up 
               now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of 
               slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his 
               preoccupation with the three men in the lobby.

               Macreedy is deep in thought. Abstractedly he tugs at his 
               collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette. 
               Tim's shoulders are slumped. Humiliation has corroded him, 
               flesh and soul. Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too, 
               feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks from one to the other 
               of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has so 
               haphazardly tossed his way. He takes a few steps to his 
               suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of something 
               better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need for 
               support. Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from 
               his bag. He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out 
               to Tim. Tim takes a drink.

               The light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware that 
               day has gone and that night is falling. The pressing, fierce 
               light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silvery 
               dreariness. The shadows have lengthened and the silver has 
               tarnished with the darkness.

               Pete comes out from behind the desk, walking from one lamp 
               in the lobby to another, turning them on.

               As Pete turns on the lamp behind Doc, he reacts ever so 
               slightly to Doc's words. His almost imperceptible grimace is 
               not lost on Macreedy. Macreedy watches the young man as he 
               continues to light the lamps...

                         it. Nothing. The whole town fell 
                         into a sort of settled melancholy, 
                         and the people in it closed their

                         the test with a whimper.

               Self-consciously Pete has backed off until now he leans 
               against the outside of the clerk's desk. But he still can't 
               shut his ears to what Doc is saying...

                              (Pete opens his mouth 
                              to say something, 
                              but Macreedy presses

                         memories of the occasion too 
                         unpleasant.

               For a moment Pete stares at Macreedy, terribly disturbed by 
               the incisiveness of Macreedy's analysis. Then...

               In sudden frustration, Pete grabs the deck of cards on the 
               clerk's desk and slams them down hard. They scatter. He turns, 
               stares blankly [...] between Doc and Macreedy.

               down at the bottle in his hand, slowly puts it on the table...

               Silence. Doc, realizing the enormity of Macreedy's admission, 
               frowns, rubs a hand across his tired eyes. Pete looks at 
               Macreedy for a long, shocked moment. He shivers.

               He takes the bottle from the table and shakily pours a shot 
               glass of liquor. As he raises it to his mouth...

               Pete is motionless, holding the glass inches from his lips, 
               hypnotized by Macreedy's voice, as hard and as cold as his 
               eyes...

               Macreedy's hand shoots out, in a short, inexorable arc, 
               smashing his palm across the shot glass. The whiskey bursts 
               in a spray, the glass flies halfway across the room, 
               shattering as it lands against something solid. Pete is 
               stunned, Doc perplexed, at Macreedy's violence. They stare 
               at him...

               Macreedy's eyes are murky. The creases between the brows 
               over his nose are deep. His nostrils move in and out with 
               his breathing. Pete and Doc regard him with growing 
               uneasiness. Rage comes into Macreedy's face, turning it a 
               painful red.

               Pete and Doc are nervously alert, drained of energy, waiting. 
               Hector is downright bored. He toys with his pistol, squinting 
               at it, twirling the barrel. Finding neither interest nor 
               pleasure in the piece, he jams it back in his holster and 
               strolls with exaggerated surety out on the porch.

<b>               EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

               The congregation of loafers look up as Hector emerges. Imbued 
               with his own bullying importance, he draws the pistol, 
               maneuvers an extravagant pinwheel and a few other gaudy 
               tricks. Then he sighs as boredom again takes over. He walks 
               down the steps to catch a bit of air.

               The disappearance of Hector (o.s.) down the street galvanizes 
               them into action. They hurry out of the lobby toward the

               Vague in the pallid light escaping through a few back windows. 
               The hotel's rear door is tightly shut. Around the far corner 
               of the street (extreme b.g.) comes the gangling body of Hector 
               David. He walks toward CAMERA. Perhaps twenty-five yards 
               away he stops to rest against a fence like a leaning tower.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - HECTOR
</b>
               His hand goes to a pocket and comes out with a crumpled half 
               pack of cigarettes. Suddenly the movement is arrested; 
               something at the other end of the street captures his bleak 
               attention.

<b>               WHAT HE SEES
</b>
               A jeep, headlights off, slowly turns the corner, pulls up to 
               the curb and parks.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE - HECTOR
</b>
               pockets his cigarettes and starts slowly for the jeep, a 
               quizzical frown on his horsy face. He approaches the back 
               door of the hotel, oblivious to it as he continues toward 
               the jeep.

<b>               INT. REAR HALLWAY OF HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
               At the far end b.g., toward the lobby, a single unshaded 
               light bulb burns dully. A slight figure stands in f.g. To 
               one side is a narrow U-shaped alcove blanketed in heavy 
               shadows. The features of the man in the hall and the slim 
               lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness. With enormous 
               care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley 
               behind the hotel. Light thrown by the back windows reveals 
               that the figure is Pete. The same pallid light from the alley, 
               glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it. Glued 
               as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is Doc. 
               He is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels 
               around which an old fire hose is wound. The heavy brass nozzle 
               of the hose hangs from the end.

               Doc grips a twelve-inch length of lead pipe. Pete swallows 
               nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to the 
               left. His eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with 
               tension.

               as he stares at Hector walking toward the jeep.

</b>                              (controlling his 
                              jangled nerves)
                         Hector!

               Hector stops, turns to face Pete. He hesitates, then...

<b>                                     HECTOR
</b>                         Hmmmm?

               Then, with a final glance at the jeep, Hector lumbers to 
               Pete, who disappears inside the hallway.

<b>               INT. REAR HALLWAY
</b>
               as Hector enters and stops. Pete quickly closes the door 
               behind him and walks toward the lobby, attempting to draw 
               Hector toward the black alcove center screen b.g. But Hector 
               is not to be sucked in. He glares at Pete, waiting. (NOTE: 
               The following dialogue is delivered sotto voce.)

<b>                                     PETE
</b>                         I thought maybe you wanted to tell 
                         Smith.

<b>                                     HECTOR
</b>                              (explaining something 
                              he feels Pete already 
                              knows)
                         Smith said he'd be here at midnight. 
                         He don't want to be disturbed.

               He jams a cigarette in his mouth. Pete watches him frantically 
               as he searches his pockets for a match. He can't find one.

<b>                                     HECTOR

</b>                         Come on. I got some in the lobby.

               He starts to turn. Hector's pig eyes are slits of suspicion. 
               Before Pete can move, Hector reaches out, hooking two heavy 
               fingers inside a pocket of Pete's shirt. Slowly Hector's 
               expression changes to one of insidious cunning. His fingers 
               come out of Pete's pocket, and between them is a paper book 
               of matches.

<b>                                     HECTOR
</b>                         I thought you didn't have a match.

               Pete is unable to answer. He is scared to death.

<b>               INT. ALCOVE - DOC
</b>
               sweating with frustration. Hector is six feet away, and armed -- 
               too far away for Doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe. 
               Doc looks around vaguely, wildly, for another weapon. A 
               fraction of an inch from his nose is the hose wheel. For a 
               split second he hesitates. Then slowly, with infinite care, 
               he tightens the heavy brass nozzle and begins to unwind the 
               hose.

<b>               INT. REAR HALLWAY
</b>
               Now Hector is alert. He studies Pete's twitching face. 
               Elaborately he tears a match from the pack and scratches it. 
               It takes fire, cupped in the rampart of his big hands. It 
               lights up the hall, and as Hector looks around he sees 
               something through a mirror -- over his shoulder and six feet 
               away Doc materializes out of the shadows of the alcove. As 
               Hector whirls, going for his gun, Doc swings the hose with 
               sudden deadly aim. It uncoils like a snake, and the brass 
               nozzle crashes with a mighty thud across Hector's skull. 
               Hector groans. He sinks unconscious to the floor. Doc stands 
               there, paralyzed by his action. Pete tears toward the lobby.

<b>               INT. LOBBY
</b>
               as Pete rushes in. He moves directly to the desk, leans over 
               and presses the buzzer behind the desk three times. He turns 
               and runs back toward the rear of the building.

<b>               INT. REAR STAIRS
</b>
               as Macreedy barrels down. He pauses briefly in the hall as 
               he sees Doc still standing with the hose and the nozzle 
               dangling like a pendulum from his hand. Their eyes lock 
               briefly in understanding...

<b>                                     MACREEDY
</b>                              (with a half smile)

                              (he gestures toward 
                              Hector, out cold)
                         ...for depriving me of that pleasure.

               He heads toward the alley.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY 
</b>
               as Macreedy rushes out. He pauses, looking quickly right, 
               then left. He sees a jeep parked at the curb far down the 
               street. He runs toward it. The jeep, its headlights off, 
               starts for him. He swings onto the moving vehicle, falling 
               heavily into the seat beside Liz Brooks. He slumps there, 
               breathing heavily as the jeep, with a grinding of gears, 
               cuts through the night, picking up speed.

<b>               INT. REAR HALLWAY 
</b>
               as Pete joins Doc. Silently, motionlessly, the two men stare 
               for a long moment at Hector -- particularly at the pistol 
               lying beside him. Then they look at each other, and the same 
               thought seems to flash in their minds...

               hard. Macreedy turns in the bucket seat, looking back toward 
               Black Rock.

               Macreedy does not answer.

               She drives skillfully over the knotty road which is little 
               more than a trail. Her lovely features are distorted with 
               her discontent and the ache for attention. After a moment 
               she gives voice to her fantasy...

               He does not catch the glance she darts him; his extreme 
               awareness is anchored not to the girl at his side but to the 
               terrain ahead.

               with Macreedy and Liz as it winds to the far end of the 
               boulders on a trail that drops off into a flat basin. Solid 
               forms loom up in the darkness; they are unrecognizable, yet 
               Macreedy senses some tense familiarity with the terrain... 
               He frowns. Suddenly Liz brakes the jeep -- so sharply Macreedy

</b>                              (harshly, through his 
                              teeth)
                         You're stupid, Liz. You're a fool. 
                         If he finishes me, he's got to finish 
                         you.

               He looks up blindly into the headlights glaring from the 
               granitic high ground some 60 yards away. His grip on the 
               girl's shoulder is like a steel trap. He pushes her down 
               beside Komako's grave, hugging the side of the jeep as a 
               SHOT rips the gravel at their feet. Pulling the girl with 
               him, he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave. 
               The jeep is between them and the headlights -- between them 
               and the source of the gunfire. Liz struggles to break away. 
               Suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him. A bullet smashes 
               into the flowers, exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt 
               into Macreedy's face. He gasps in pain, releasing Liz. He 
               rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind. 
               Liz breaks from the grave. Now, five yards from Macreedy...

               Liz half turns, facing Macreedy with a vicious smile...

               She starts toward the headlights.

               She reaches the foot of the rocky ridge, with the two enormous

               She is almost at the top; a vertically sheer rock about five 
               feet high separates her from it. She looks up at Smith, 
               towering over her at the edge of the precipice. He holds his 
               rifle almost languorously.

               He brings the rifle down, aiming almost casually at Liz. Her 
               eyes go wide. She steps back, spins around, running crazily 
               down the steep incline.

               A SHOT rings out. She falls forward, rolling slowly down the 
               embankment. She lies there. Blood trickles from the corner 
               of her pretty mouth. A rattling noise rises from deep in her 
               throat, and then subsides.

               In the silence the outline of Reno Smith emerges. Holding 
               his rifle at the ready, his silhouette illuminated sharply 
               in the twin beams of light, he climbs down the side of the 
               cliff. He looks toward the jeep and Macreedy, not once at 
               the girl at his feet.

                         You shouldn't have done that...

               Smith pays no attention to her. He advances inexorably with 
               rifle held at his hip. He fires at Macreedy.

<b>               EXT. GRAVE
</b>
               Macreedy wipes the last of the fragments from his eyes. His 
               face is still streaked with dirt and shale. He turns, 
               searching for something, anything, to fight back with. Then 
               he remembers... Stiffening, his body set, his eyes narrow, 
               he moves purposefully toward the front of the jeep and crawls 
               under it. Again Smith opens up on him. Bullet after bullet 
               pours into the confined space, nicking the wall, ricocheting 
               off the jeep with a frightening, fluttery, wheezing sound. 
               The firing stops again and in the silence we HEAR a familiar 
               TRICKLE, as in running water...

<b>               EXT. RANCH - SMITH
</b>
               re-loads his rifle. Stiffly, he starts slowly down over the 
               rocks toward his unarmed victim...

<b>               MACREEDY
</b>
               He has unscrewed the nut and unconnected the gas line with 
               the carburator. A spurt of gasoline is running out. With a 
               quick motion he picks up an empty whisky bottle from the 
               litter-strewn earth. He fills it with gasoline, quickly screws 
               the nut back on. Now he sweeps his necktie free of his collar. 
               Holding it with his teeth, he tears the felt lining free 
               from its silk face. He twists half the lining inside the 
               bottle, knotting the other end securely around the bottle's 
               neck, leaving a long strand dangling.

               moving rigidly toward the hole. He stops, levels his rifle, 
               fires.

<b>               EXT. GRAVE - MACREEDY

               pinned down in the direct line of fire. The burst of the 
               rifle stops.

<b>               EXT. RANCH - SMITH

               not more than twenty-five yards away, advancing carefully,

               lights a match, placing the flame to the dangling end of the 
               tie. It catches. He flings himself to his feet and with the 
               same motion whips the fiery bottle like a football, hard and 
               straight toward Smith. Smith fires once, fast and wild. The 
               bottle crashes against the rocks at his feet and bursts with 
               a shattering explosion. Smith screams as the razor-sharp 
               slivers rip his flesh. In a puff of flame, his clothes ignite. 
               He drops the rifle and goes down, squirming frantically on 
               the black ashy ground.

               favoring Macreedy as he tears out of the hole. He hurls 
               himself at Smith. Wooden-faced, almost dreamy-eyed, he shovels 
               the ashy dirt over Smith's prone chest, putting out the fire. 
               Smith struggles halfway to his feet. Macreedy grabs his 
               shoulder, helping him up. Smith looks at Macreedy through 
               eyes bleary with fear and pain and shock.

                         you'll die.

               He drives his right fist against Smith's chin. Smith's head 
               snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on 
               his chest. He collapses. Macreedy blows out his breath hard. 
               He staggers to Liz. As he bends over her...

               Liz's jeep, driven by Macreedy, rolls slowly down the empty 
               main street of the sleeping town. Behind him, under a tarp, 
               the body of the girl lies lifeless across the seat. On the 
               seat beside him is Smith's rifle, the balance a few inches 
               from Macreedy's elbow. On the right front fender of the jeep 
               Smith sits precariously, his shirt scorched and ragged. He 
               wears a sullen expression of pained indifference.

               In b.g., as the jeep passes, isolated lights go on, first in 
               Doc's house, then in two or three others. Macreedy is 
               oblivious to them.

               almost completely hidden, looks out grimly from a corner of 
               the jail window. Protruding through the bars, swiveling to 
               follow the progress of the jeep down the street, is the long, 
               ugly muzzle of a rifle.

               as Macreedy pulls up to the curb in front of the jail and 
               cuts the ignition. He grabs the rifle, and steps around to 
               Smith.

               A man emerges, wearing a Mackinaw over his vest and carrying 
               a rifle. It is Tim. For a moment Macreedy eyes him in silence. 
               His gun finger tightens on the rifle in his hand. Tim's rifle, 
               too, is at the ready...

               The SOUND of running feet padding along the dirt road 
               increases on SOUND TRACK. Macreedy turns slightly, to see 
               Doc huffing toward him. The older man climbs the jail steps 
               and comes to an abrupt halt, his eyes going from one to the 
               other of the two men in the stand-off.

                         It's all right, Macreedy...

               He pulls Tim's Mackinaw to one side, revealing the silver-
               plated star pinned at the breast.

               Macreedy swings his rifle from Tim to Smith. Tim lowers his, 
               stepping to one side, allowing Smith, covered by Macreedy, 
               to enter the jail. He goes in, Doc following. Pete sits

               and propels him roughly through the cell door. He slams it 
               hard. As the clatter of the iron door reverberates harshly...

<b>               EXT. HOTEL - BLACK ROCK - DAY
</b>
               The townspeople, with Doc f.g., are gathered silently in the 
               street, staring sadly, dumbly at the hotel before them. Doc 
               wears a dark business suit, neat and conservative. The door 
               opens (o.s.) and the people look up, their eyes lighting 
               with expectancy.

<b>               WHAT THEY SEE
</b>
               Macreedy comes out of the door, carrying his suitcase. For a 
               moment he pauses, looking at the uplifted faces of the people 
               in the street. In the distance we HEAR the horn of a stream-
               liner. Macreedy goes down the steps, skirts the watching 
               crowd and heads for the railroad station. Almost immediately 
               Doc falls in step with him. The townspeople, still silent, 
               trail after them

               in f.g., the townspeople behind them. In b.g., as we pass, 
               we see the main street just as we saw it when Macreedy entered 
               town a few short hours ago.

                              beat, to Doc)
                         Tim knows where to find me if I'm 
                         needed.

               Doc nods. He blinks and frowns...

                         something we can maybe build on. 
                         This town is wrecked, just as bad as 
                         if it was bombed out. Maybe it can 
                         come back...

</b>                         Some towns come back. Some don't. It 
                         depends on the people.

               A NOISE o.s. attracts Macreedy's attention. He turns, as do 
               Doc and the townsmen.

<b>               WHAT THEY SEE
</b>
               In front of the jail, each of them handcuffed, are Smith, 
               Coley, Hector, Sam and Hastings. Tim and four cops escort 
               them to two State Police cars which are parked beside Tim's 
               old sedan and another car (presumably belonging to a member 
               of the press). The newspaperman (WITHOUT A PRESS CARD IN HIS 
               HAT) stands to one side with Pete. Pete as well as Tim have 
               changed clothes; they look clean and trim. Coley has his arm 
               in a sling. Hector's hat hides the bandage on his head.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE
</b>
               Macreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station, with 
               Doc at his side and the people behind him. The train pulls 
               in.

<b>                                     DOC
</b>                              (still pressing)
                         That medal would help.

               Macreedy is silent. He walks on, to the platform. He pauses, 
               looking at the people silently in his wake and then at Doc. 
               He takes a black velvet-covered box from his pocket -- the 
               box containing the medal -- looks at it, and slowly hands it 
               to Doc.

<b>                                     DOC
</b>                         Thanks, Macreedy. Thanks for 
                         everything.

               Macreedy turns and exits from SHOT. The people look after 
               him.

               The cars in front of the jail U-turn and start off with the 
               prisoners. The people move silently toward the train.

<b>               EXT. TRAIN
</b>
               Macreedy is at the passageway. Slowly the train moves out.

<b>               INT. PASSAGEWAY OF TRAIN
</b>
               Macreedy and a conductor stand at the doorway. The town is 
               seen behind them and the people standing there. In the 
               distance, Tim's car recedes.

                         What's the excitement? What happened?
