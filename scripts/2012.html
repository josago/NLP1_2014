</b>          Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the
          drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66,
          listens to the music.
<b>          
</b>          An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy
          ship across a puddle.

</b>          The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.

</b>                       Watch out!
<b>          
</b>          But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the
          puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.
<b>          
</b>          In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The
          driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.

</b>          The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics -

</b>          As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting
          for this science lab.

</b>                    Helmsley told me that the neutrino

</b>          They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small
          group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all
          show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.

</b>                    There was a new solar storm, so strong
                    that the physical reaction got even
                    more severe.

</b>                    We don't know, Professor, sir.
<b>          
</b>          Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch
          on the floor and hot steam rises.

</b>          Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the
          water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale.

          shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the

</b>          Anheuser puts out his hand. Adrian takes it.

          next to his parents. Mrs. Pang turns to her husband.

<b>          
</b>          The old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the
          front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah.
<b>

</b>          He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to
          him.

<b>          
</b>          Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and
          hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them.

</b>                    I'd say... those astronauts of yours

                    in the South Pole.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a
          burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd.
<b>          
</b>          Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to
          roll back and light streams in.

</b>          The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser
          looks hopeful. Jackson pulls his family close as the first

          covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy.
<b>          
</b>          Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's
          HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site--
<b>          
</b>          The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak,
          surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most
