          Very late. All is quiet. Then a battered MINI-VAN blows by
          a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO
          CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOT

          The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back the hair of
          two BEAT-UP-LOOKING MEN. The driver, FRED SEARING, 40-ish,
          has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face,
          despite the BLACK EYE and BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE dangling out
          of his nose. The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38.

          that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side
          of the mini-van.
          Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS

<b>                         FRED
</b>          I called your office and they told
          me you were in the neighborhood.
          Rick turns to the couple.

</b>          Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred
          Searing. Fred, this is Harold and
          Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up
          here from Long Island.

<b>                         FRED
</b>          Well, mazel tov, folks.
          The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a
          card.

<b>                         FRED (CONT'D)

          Rick quickly jumps in.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          (to the Goldbergs)
          Uh, why don't you two take another
          look around and if you have any
          questions I'll be right here.

<b>                         FRED
</b>          You weren't picking up your cell--I
          wanted to see how much trouble you
          got in last night. You know what
          Grace made me do? She made me call
          the Longs and apologize.
          Rick flinches.

</b>          Oof .

          when you got home?

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Uh... sort of.
          Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's
          aren't listening. Then:

<b>                          RICK (CONT'D)
</b>          She gave me a hall pass.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          A week off from marriage to do
          whatever I want. She's going to her
          parents' house down the Cape 'til

          something?

</b>          Yeah, but there's a part of me
          that's saying, 'Wow, you must have
          pushed her pretty hard to get her
          to this point.' And is that good
          for a marriage? That your wife is
          willing to try something this
          insane?
          Fred can't believe his ears.

          our wives dreams all come true, but
          ours don't? Look at Maggie; when
          she was a kid she played house--you
          g a ve her a house. She played with
          her E-Z-Bake Oven--you bought her a
          Viking. She played mommy--you made
          her a mommy.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          The oven's a GE.

           Fred's mini-van is parked on the street in front of his home.
           We HEAR Styx's The Best of Times coming from inside the car
          and we MOVE IN CLOSER until we're...
          LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW at Fred. He's sitting
          in the driver's seat; his EYES ARE CLOSED and his head is
          slung back as he JERKS-OFF (just below frame) to the MUSIC.
          A POLICE CRUISER passes in the b.g., then a moment later
          BACKS INTO FRAME and STOPS NEXT TO FRED.
          As the two POLICE OFFICERS look on from their car trying to
          figure out what the guy is doing, the oblivious Fred
          continues to STROKE HIS MEAT to the BEAT.

          only inches from Fred, he bends over and LOOKS INSIDE THE

</b>          The Officer motions for his partner to join him. As Fred
          continues to POUND HIMSELF TO THE MUSIC, Officer #2 climbs
          out of the cruiser. He takes out his flashlight and SHINES
          IT ON FRED'S O.S. LAP. As the weary officers look at each

          PAN to Fred's front steps where we see a HANDCUFFED Fred
          standing meekly as the two Police Officers confer with a
          furious-looking Grace (in her bathrobe.)

          Grace and Maggie find out we can't
          get laid on our own, they'll start
          thinking we need them to get laid.
          Do you know what that'll do to the
          balance of power in our homes?
          It'll destroy it!
          Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed.

          that we did hook up?

<b>                         FRED
</b>          We can't. Grace'll know. She always
          knows when I'm lying.

</b>          No! That's giving up.

</b>          You don't get it, do you? A hall
          pass ain't all about sex. It's

          woman even though you may not be

          Rick seems stung by this news.

<b>                         FRED (CONT'D)
</b>          Look, if we can't show that
          something positive can come from
          having a hall pass, then the whole
          concept is dead. Not just for
          us...but for all mankind.

          TYPE whips his leg into the sink beside him. Rick slowly

          he fills his hand with SHAVING CREAM and the hand DISAPPEARS
          BETWEEN HIS OWN LEGS. The guys continue their conversation,
          unfazed. Then the Metrosexual starts to SHAVE HIS BALLS.

</b>          Yeah, yeah, Baker filled me in.
          S'been rough sledding, huh?
          Coakley puts his arms around the two guys.

<b>                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)

          A mass of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and SLICK GUYS vie for position
          outside this CROWDED CLUB.
          REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Rick, Fred and Coakley watching from
          across the street.

<b>                         COAKLEY
</b>          I'm gonna need three-hundred bucks.

<b>                         FRED
</b>          For what?
          Coakley shoots him a look.

</b>          If you're really serious about
          this, stop questioning me.
          The guys look at each other, then reluctantly COUGH UP THE
          DOUGH. With money in hand, Coakley marches confidently
          across the street followed by Fred and Rick. When the SLICK
          BOUNCER sees them approaching, he PARTS THE CROWD.

<b>                         COAKLEY
</b>          What up, my guy?
          Coakley PASSES ON THE MONEY with a handshake and the Bouncer
          UNHOOKS THE VELVET ROPE. Then Coakley smiles back at Fred
          and Rick.

          Coakley leads them into the club. Rick and Fred can't

<b>                         COAKLEY
</b>          Okay, guys, you tried it your way

          The guys look at Coakley like Richard Gere looks at the Dalai
          Lama.

          Rick and Fred are visibly deflated.

<b>                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Guys, you're not trying to get
          married here--you're trying to get
          laid.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Aren't you the guy who goes to the
          Hawaiian Tropic finals every year?
          Is that for the ugly girls?

<b>                         COAKLEY
</b>          I go to the Tropic finals because
          Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and
          she's gonna need a hug. And quite
          often you can parlay a hug into a
          hand-job. Rick, you're up--get us
          two bottles of Moet and six
          glasses.
          Rick shoots Fred a look, then weaves his way through a scrum
          of PEOPLE up to the bar. He tries to flag down a bartender
          but can't get anyone's attention.

<b>          PAIGE (O.S.)
</b>          Hi, Mr. Mills.
          Rick turns to see that he's crammed in beside his babysitter
          Paige who's looking a LITTLE TIPSY.

</b>          Oh, hey, Paige. What are you doing
          here?
          She pulls out her license and holds it up.

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          I turned twenty-one yesterday.

</b>          Oh. Well, happy birthday. You out
          celebrating?

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg.
          Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead,
          early 40's, who's talking to a couple of YOUNG MEN.

<b>                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
</b>          She's the best. Forty-two years old
          but she still parties like she's my
          age.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Nice.
          Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention.

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          So, Rick, how's the hall pass
          going?
          Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little.

<b>                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
</b>          You don't mind if I call you Rick,
          do you? I am officially an adult
          now.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          No, of course not--what did you
          just say?

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          I was asking about your hall pass.
          (off Rick's look)
          I baby-sit for the Putneys and I
          heard Gary talking about it the
          other night at their barbecue.
          Rick REACTS to this.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          He was talking about it at a
          barbecue?!

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad
          way.

<b>                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
</b>          In fact, I thought it was very
          classy of you to be staying at the
          Holiday Inn Express instead of
          bringing girls back to your home
          with all the kids' pictures and
          schoolwork taped up everywhere.
          Rick forces a smile.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Thank you.
          A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick.

<b>                          RICK (CONT'D)
</b>          Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and
          six glasses please.
          Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink.

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          So does it work both ways?

<b>                         RICK
</b>          What?

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          The hall pass. Does your wife get
          one, too.

<b>                         RICK
</b>
<b>                         (AMUSED)
</b>          Uh, no, no. A hall pass is for men
          only.

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          Oh. Who made that rule?

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Well ...um...
          As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter.

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          By the way, I kind of owe you an
          apology.
          (lowers her voice,

<b>                         BASH
</b>          Last week ful) when you drove me home, I
           shouldn't have snapped at you like
          that.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Oh, don't worry about it. It was a
          big misunderstanding.

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          No, it wasn't.
          She takes a moment, looks around.

</b>          If you thought I was coming on to
          you that night, it's because...I
          was.
          Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns with
          the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally
          pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love-
          with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but
          it was great seeing you.
          Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly
          annoyed.

<b>                         PAIGE
</b>          Are you serious? You're doing this
          again... even with a hall pass?

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Paige, you're my kids' babysitter.
          Have a happy birthday.
          As Rick walks away, we go
          BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne.

<b>                         COAKLEY
</b>          Here we go, bubbles doth floweth.

<b>                         FRED
</b>          Holy crap... look who's here.
          The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past
          with two of her GIRLFRIENDS. She sees them and LIGHTS UP.

<b>                         LEIGH
</b>          Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday--
          I thought we were gonna grab a
          beer?
          Fred looks at Rick, confused.

<b>                         RICK
</b>
<b>                         (SHEEPISH)
</b>          Yeah, I got a little caught up in
          my curls and reps and shit.

<b>                         (CHANGING SUBJECT)

<b>                         LEIGH
</b>          Nah, I've never been here, but a
          friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so
          I promised him I'd come.
          Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives
          Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones
          hanging around his neck.

<b>                         WANNABE

</b>          Oh. Hey. What are you doing here--
          you auditing the place?

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Actually, I work for Sirius XM
          Radio--we're looking to hire some
          new deejays so I'm checking out all
          the clubs.
          Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful.

<b>                         WANNABE
</b>          Oh. Cool. Are you serious?

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Not!
          Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the
          deflated Wannabe.

<b>                         WANNABE
</b>
<b>                         (ANNOYED)
</b>          Oh, that's hip. Real fresh.
          (turns to Leigh)
          Why don't you hit the dance floor--
          the next song's gonna be for you.
          As Leigh's Girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor, Wannabe
          returns to his deejay booth.

          were at the massage parlor trying
          to get a rub-and-tug without

          It begins with a 'P' and ends with

          Coakley spots something.

          But Coakley steers Fred over to two CHUBBY, NOT-SO-ATTRACTIVE
          BLONDES laying on a 'bed' in the corner.

          A glum Rick is walking through the PACKED PARTY when he bumps
          into Baker and Hog-Head standing around a keg with a GROUP OF

<b>          GUYS.
</b>
<b>                         RICK
</b>          Hey. . .what are you guys doing here?

<b>                         HOG-HEAD
</b>          We're here for the hall pass.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Really? I thought you guys had
          given up on us?

<b>                         BAKER
</b>          We did. We're here with them.
          He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's
          and paunchy.

<b>                         RICK

</b>          When Leary and Boshane heard about
          your guy's hall pass, they
          convinced their wives to give them
          one, too.
          A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none
          of it. He turns to Baker, livid.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          You weren't supposed to tell anyone
          about the hall pass!

<b>                         LEARY
</b>          They didn't say anything. Our wives
          heard about it at the pool.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          No! At the pool?!
          Rick rubs his face, distressed.

<b>                         BOSHANE
</b>          Yep. And then about three days ago--
          after some hard-core negotiating--
          we managed to push the bill
          through.
          The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Really? So...how's it going?

<b>                         BOSHANE
</b>          Solid. Very solid.

          Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION.

</b>          Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just
          about sex, you know.

<b>                         BOSHANE
</b>          That's right. It's about going
          bowling and, uh, staying up late,
          and being able to do what you want
          to do when you want to do it.

<b>                         RICK

</b>          It's a lot tougher than we thought
          it would be.
          Just then Gary comes around a corner.

          The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck.
          A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and
          pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he
          OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH

</b>          No. I told you, I just had to talk
          him off the ledge. I calmed him
          down and sent him on his way.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Oh. Uh, great.

<b>                         LEIGH
</b>          So where's that game room? I

          games.
          She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go...

<b>          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
          Rick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens
          the door and flips on the light.
          THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a
          bar, and a bed.

<b>                         LEIGH
</b>          I'll be right back--I just have to
          use the bathroom.
          Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears
          into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it.
          Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the
          hallway and pushes open a door.

<b>          COAKLEY (O.S.)
</b>          Hey.
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small
          study off the hall. He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap
          and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show.

</b>          Hey. How come you're not downstairs
          partying?
          Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile.

<b>                         COAKLEY
</b>          All partied out, pal.
          Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the

</b>          Man, that Barney Fife still kills

          He looks back to Rick.

<b>                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey, I was thinking about this hall-
          pass business. It's really ironic,
          isn't it?
          Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          How's that?

<b>                         COAKLEY
</b>          Well think about it. There's two
          kinds of guys who cheat on their
          wives: The guy who does it behind
          her back, and a guy like you who
          has his wife's permission.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Well it's not really cheating if I
          have permission.

<b>                         COAKLEY
</b>          Yeah, whatever. The point is, if
          you asked a hundred people who the
          better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em
          would pick you, because you're
          being honest--there's no deceit
          involved.
          Rick is growing uncomfortable.

<b>                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          But the funny thing is, the other
          guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he
          has to live with all that guilt and
          anxiety, while his wife's running
          around happy as a clam because she
          doesn't know anything. And you, the
          good guy, you've got no guilt at
          all because you just laid it all on
          your wife's shoulders.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Well I didn't really think of it

          Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.

<b>                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Funny, huh?

          a genius.

          Paige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch. Her legs are
          crossed revealing a lot of skin. Fred hands her a glass of
          wine and sits beside her.

</b>          Hey, she's a good kid. I do what I
          can for the kids.
          Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly.

<b>                         AUNT MEG
</b>          She told me everything. And I have
          to say, I was very impressed.

<b>                         AUNT MEG

<b>                         RICK
</b>          No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be

          commitments.
          Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her
          DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him
          and she's PERFECT.

          For a moment nobody moves. We can almost hear Rick's heart
          beat. Then Leigh STEPS CLOSER to him and Rick instinctively
          leans back.

<b>                         LEIGH

          of your life, but tonight. . .you
          have me.
          Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or
          three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never
          from a woman this beautiful.
          She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF
          HIS SHIRT. They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged guy
          and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way Rick
          had hoped it would, the dream.
          She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS NECK,
          her hand DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS WAIST. Then she
