          A neat, well-appointed flat, tastefully decorated. Framed
          against a large window which looks out over the city, an
          elegant woman in her 70's: EVELYN GREENSLADE. She's on the

          On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer;
          the screen reads 'Getting Started ...'

          is on a stand beside him.

</b>          Bloody retirement parties. Hard
          cheese, soft wine, and endless
          speeches. Why do people do that?
          No one ever said about any kind
          of party: it was a wonderful
          occasion, just a shame that the

</b>          An occasion such as this leads
          one to cast ones mind back to the
          days when I first entered my
          pupillage. I had the very good
          fortune of serving as a junior to
          Mr Justice Stancombe
          Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the
          room. At the old, tired faces.

</b>          . the unwelcome news that I
          would transfer Chambers, bringing
          to mind the old adage a fronte
          praecipitium, a tergo 1upi
          Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving
          more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the
          same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          This is the day.
          Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as
          they are that he's spoken out loud.

          The sun rises. A beautiful, pearly dawn.
          The bus drives through the great gates of Jaipur. Below,
          the city shimmers in the heat. It's a magnificent sight.

          Our heroes are squashed into a pair of them, facing
          forwards and backwards, attempting not to swallow too much
          dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning
          streets of the city. They stare in amazement at the world
          racing past them.
          A scooter overtakes. A young man is driving, his
          girlfriend riding side-saddle on the back. Her sari
          billows out behind her. Douglas and Evelyn both watch her,
          struck by this image of beauty, youth and vitality.

          The tuk-tuks have pulled up, and our travellers emerge,
          exhausted and dirty, staring through some garden gates at
          the Marigold Hotel. Once a beautiful building, once
          possibly even luxurious, it is clearly in the process of
          being given at least half the face-lift it badly needs.
          Parts of the building are freshly painted, some of the
          ornate balconies are crumbling, and one wall is clad with
          crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding. A huge old tree towers
          over an untended garden, its branches poking into the
          windows of the building.

          A young man leans out from an upper balcony to see the
          arrival below: SONNY KAPOOR (early 20's).
          He deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet, and races
          off across the rooftop.

          by a couple of young houseboys who then run to the tuk-tuks
          to collect their luggage.

          The courtyard is not without charm, although somewhat
          delapidated. A fountain at the centre does not look as if
          it has seen water in years, and faded awnings are strung up
          haphazardly.

          Uncertain, Evelyn turns down a narrow alley, and suddenly
          finds herself in an enclosed courtyard strewn with
          makeshift washing lines. The atmosphere is faintly
          threatening.
          As she tries to find her way out, she becomes aware that
          she is being watched: the walls are full of doorways, and
          people have come out to stare at her. She has stumbled
          into their home.
          Evelyn tries to suppress her panic, turning from one face
          to another.

          Graham is playing cricket with the teenagers. He's good,

          walks to the other end, then turns for a second run,
          breathing heavily. Then walks back to the crease, gets
          ready for the next delivery.
          It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for
          years.

          They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to
          the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to
          bowl.
          As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems
          to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to
          reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys,
          frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave
          Sanjay's hand.
          Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and
          is bowled.

          Muriel is back. She's in her chair, on the terrace outside
          her room.
          A young hotel worker, ANOKHI, brings out a tray of food to
          her.
          Muriel watches her, but Anokhi is deferential, won't meet
          Muriel's eyes. She puts the tray down and leaves.
          Muriel just sits there, glaring balefully into the night,
          the untouched tray of food by her side.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          I grew up here. Just a short
          drive away. It was a big house,
          and we had servants, everyone
          did. We knew their wives, their
          children. One boy, Manoj, became
          my friend. We played a lot of
          cricket together, played anything
          we could. And that's how it
          stayed for years. Until one
          night, he became something more.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          We had a few months, we had that.
          There was a weekend in Udaipur,
          we sat by a lake and watched the
          sun go down, and I remember
          thinking . I will never be this
          happy again. And I was right.
          Because quite suddenly it was
          over. We'd fallen asleep, and
          they found us.

</b>          For me it was bad enough. But I
          already knew who I was, and I
          think my family had guessed. For
          Manoj, the disgrace was absolute;
          a double taboo. His father was
          fired, they were sent away, all
          of them. I don't know what I
          could've done, but it should've
          been more than nothing. I put up
          no fight. I let it happen.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Soon afterwards I went to
          England, to University. I always
          told myself I'd come back. But I
          never did.

</b>          Jean is looking out of her bathroom window, down into the
          courtyard.
          She sees Graham come out of his room. She turns back to
          the mirror, looks at herself.

          Near to Muriel, Anokhi is sweeping the floor.

<b>                         MURIEL
</b>          You won't get the dirt out like
          that.
          Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly.

<b>                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
</b>          I worked in service for years,
          looked after a lovely house. I
          kept it spotless. You need a bit
          more pressure on that brush.
          Graham walks past, on his way out.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          She won't speak English. She's
          what used to be called an
          Untouchable. An outcast, born
          below society. To a good Hindu,
          even her shadow is polluted.
          He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door.

<b>                         MURIEL
</b>          Where d'you go every day? Is it
          a woman? Nip round there for a
          curry and a bit of afters?

          Although nowadays more in theory
          than practice. Good day.
          He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out.
          Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has
          already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her.

<b>                         JEAN
</b>          Good morning.
          Muriel says nothing.

</b>          Yes, I see that. Perhaps you

          had her breakfast. Tea or
          coffee. Semi-skimmed milk,
          always. If she's under 50 she'll
          be contemplating yet another
          diet, over 50 she'll have more or
          less given up, and be eating
          toast. The radio may be playing,
          or more likely daytime TV. A
          chat show, or a programme with a
          moderator speaking to a panel of
          young women whose boyfriends have
          all slept with their mothers.

          He leads her along across the terrace. Madge follows,
          checking her hair, her breath, etc.
          The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture. There's
          someone sitting there, his back to us, an elegant arm
          draped over the side of the chair.

          The man rises from his chair and turns. And Madge is left
          staring at Norman.
          There's a pause. Then Madge reaches into the barman's
          breast pocket, and removes her money.

          across at the bar, where an attractive older ex-pat lady is
          sitting, thus far resisting Norman's attempts to catch her
          eye.

          couple of seats away from the woman. Who is called CAROL.

          Ajit is now pushing Muriel through a poverty-stricken slum.
          The people live on the streets, or in collapsing tin
          shacks. Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation.
          And yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as
          depressing as we would expect. The colours are bright, the
          smiles on the children's faces even brighter.
          Not that Muriel can recognise the joy, of course. She's
          horrified by her surroundings. And acutely aware of the
          stares of the slum-dwellers.

          wheelchair, pushing it around and taking turns to sit on
          it.

          are all the generations of Anokhi's family: Anokhi herself,

          to fiddle with it. Douglas joins Evelyn.

          decided to take me to another
          hotel, that he was sure I would
          prefer. And of course one wants

          But when the ride began I felt
          mine give a little, like it might
          collapse. Then these strong arms
          were around me, holding the horse

          There's silence for a bit. Then Ajit speaks.

          Muriel smiles. It's the first time we've seen this.

          Chocolate Hobnobs.
          This time it's Muriel who cannot meet Anokhi's eye. Tries

          The cacophonous sound of drumming: a small band of players
          are beating out a deafening, syncopated rhythm as the
          Ganeshi festival begins to unfold.
          Sonny is on his bike, Sunaina riding side-saddle on the
          back. They're speeding through the city.
          Sonny rockets through an arch way up a side street, is
          confronted by a huge traffic jam. The Ganeshi procession is
          bringing everything to a standstill.
