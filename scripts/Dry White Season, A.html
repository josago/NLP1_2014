</b><b>EXT. DAN PIENAAR SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY
</b>
Dan Pienaar school is a typical Johannesburg Afrikaan
school. The students are mainly from middle-class
families. School athletics are in progress. The stu-
dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering
enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept
sports ground.
GORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work-
ing in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15-
years-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching
the games.
BEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is
enthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old,
who is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last
leg of the race. The excitement increases as they
approach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son
with shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next
to Ben, is shouting "come on Johan," and slapping the
father on the back.
Johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The
ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan.
Ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud
father pushing his way through the animated boys. As he
reaches Johan he pats him on the back.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             This was your best race.
<b>                           JOHAN
</b>                    (excited)
             I beat him, Papa.

<b>                           BEN
</b>                    (proudly)
             You did son. Come on, shower.

They walk happily towards the school buildings in conver-
sation, Johan being slapped on the back by friends. Ben
stops to talk to Gordon who jumps to his feet.

<b>                         BEN
</b>           I'll be expecting you. There
           isn't much to do, only weeding
           the marigolds and watering the
           lawn and flowers.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                           GORDON
</b>             We'll be there, Mr. Ben'sir,
             Jonathan come to help me.
Ben hadn't seen Jonathan.    He turns to him.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             And how's the algebra?   Still
             giving you trouble?
<b>                           JONATHAN
</b>                    (with respect)
             Just a little, Mr. Ben'sir.
<b>                          JOHAN
</b>             Me too.

<b>                           GORDON
</b>                    (straightening himself)
             He's working hard, Mr. Ben'sir,
             and your money will not be
             wasted. Emily and me will always
             thank you.

<b>                           BEN
</b>                    (as he leaves)
             See you both later.
Gordon returns to his work a little distance further. A
group of students are laughing and pushing each other
boisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each
other and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan. He
falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to
attack the boy. Gordon shouts "Jonathan."
The headmaster, MRS. CLOETE, aged 65 years, has observed
the incident, but takes no action.

Jonathan stands panting with rage.       He suddenly strides
away towards the gate in a rage.

<b>                           GORDON
</b>                    (shouting angrily)
             U ya phi?
             (Where are you going?)

Jonathan turns to look at his father and continues to
walk off.

<b>EXT. SOWETO BEER HALL - AFTERNOON
</b>The beer hall is a large complex with a drinking area
with long rows of low benches.
<b>                                           (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                      3.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>Men sit drinking African beer in one-half and one gallon
plastics containers. The place buzzes with noise.
Several people are touting wares for sale.
Suddenly a group of about twenty youths walks into the
drinking area, obviously to cause trouble. The LEADER
starts to address the clients.

<b>                           LEADER
</b>             Your children are starving and you
             are drinking. We demand freedom
             and our fathers are drunk. We ask
             you to boycott these beer halls.
             Revolution and drink don't work
             together!

A large MAN WITH SIDEBURNS, obviously drunk, stands up, a
stick in his hand.
<b>                           MAN WITH SIDEBURNS
</b>             Since when do children talk like
             this to their fathers? They need
             thrashing.

The man and several others advance on the boys. The boys
run into the serving area, close the doors and start
breaking up the place. Two police Land Rovers SCREECH to
a halt outside. The boys run out through a side en-
trance. They are chased by the police who are black.
Jonathan and his best friend Wellington, also 15 years,
are walking towards the beer hall when the boys come
running out chased by the police. It is prudent for
them to run down the street. The boys and police are
bearing down on them. Their escape is cut off by the
apperance of another police Land Rover. Two policemen,
two blacks and two whites join in the capture. Jonathan,
Wellington and about ten of the boys are arrested.
As they are hundled into the vehicle, they protest their
innocence without success and are driven away.

<b>INT. SOWETO POLICE STATION - CHARGE OFFICE - AFTERNOON
</b>The charge office is sparcely furnished with a long bench
along a wall. There is a reception counter with Sgt:
Van Zyl in charge. The boys are lined up against a wall.
The sergeant stands with a tall blond man with a scar on
his chin, CAPTAIN STOLZ.

<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                       4.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>The sergeant reads out a name and    looks at Stolz; if he
nods the boy stands aside. After     this ritual, the ones
that Stolz has chosen are marched    to a waiting police van
and driven away. The others are     taken to the cells at
the police station, these include    Jonathan and
Wellington.

<b>EXT. DUTCH REFORM CHURCH - DAY
</b>The MUSIC STOPS. The doors open. The 40 years-old-
minister Bester comes to the door, then stands and greets
his parishioners as they file out of the church.
Amongst them, Ben Du Toit -- his wife, SUSAN, a clean-
cut, immaculate, "toe-the-line" beauty and his son, Johan
-- the blond, blue-eyed, tanned and torsoed fourteen-
year-old every father dreams of. Susan greets friends
and acquaintances, pausing to chat... mostly formalities.
Johan, his eyes on a girl his age. She is with her
father, Mr. Cloete, the headmaster -- she smiles at Johan
from a distance; he waves awkwardly as she drives off
with her parents.
SUZETTE his daughter, sophisticated -- groomed. She
takes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car,
carries the child to the group chatting with CHRIS, her
husband. She shows it off proudly. Ben is chatting,
concerned, to a WOMAN. She looks drawn and worried.

<b>                           MRS. COETZEE (WOMAN)
</b>             He won't come to church. He lies
             in bed all day, listening to his
             headphones.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             I wondered why he wasn't at
             school. Would it help if I came
             to see him? He's always seemed a
             good kid to me.
<b>                           MRS. COETZEE
</b>             Oh, would you?
<b>                          BEN
</b>             Of course. I'll phone and we can
             fix a time.

Mrs. Coetzee smiles her gratitude.
<b>                           SUSAN
</b>             Ben!   Ben!

She's waving impatiently at him.     He crosses back to her.
Suzette's BABY is HOWLING.

<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                        5.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>She rocks it back and forth, holding it at arm's length.
The BABY SCREAMS. The nanny comes forward -- Suzette
hands it over.
<b>                             SUSAN
</b>             Mrs. Coetzee.    She looked worried.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             She's having trouble with her boy.
             He won't come to school.

<b>                           SUSAN
</b>             So you said you'd have a word with
             him?

<b>                             BEN
</b>             Yes!
She smiles and walks him to the car affectionately.
<b>EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - BARBECUE - DAY
</b>The Du Toit family.

Susan is bringing out the salads. Chris, her son-in-law,
is at the barbecue, stinging his eyes. Ben is bouncing
his grandson, little Hennie, in a small, portable pool.
The black nanny sits in attendance in the shade, a towel
at the ready. The good life...
... Suddenly disturbed by... Gordon and Jonathan standing
uncertain at the far side of the garden; Gordon's hat
pressed flat against his chest, Jonathan defiant.

Susan looks up -- as do each in turn -- curious at the
intrusion... then the black nanny -- and finally Ben.
After a moment, Ben walks up to Gordon.

<b>                            BEN
</b>             Gordon!   What are you doing here?

<b>INT. BEN'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>Six cuts, like six knife gashes, revealed on the blood-
stained buttocks of Gordon's son, who stands in painful,
truculent embarrassment.

Ben is shocked by the severity of the canning.
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             That's not why I'm complaining,
             Mister Ben, sir. If he did wrong,
             I'd beat him myself. But he
             didn't.

<b>                                               (CONTINUED)

</b><b>                                                           6.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                           GORDON
</b>             He did nothing and they wouldn't
             listen. They wouldn't believe
             him.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             I'm sorry, Gordon.    But there
             must be a reason.
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             He says he wasn't doing anything
             wrong, Mister Ben, sir. And I
             believe him, I know my son! It's
             an injustice!

<b>                           BEN
</b>             What about the court?    Didn't he
             state his case?
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             What does he know about court?
             Before he knew, it was all over.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             I don't think there is anything we
             can do about it now.
Outside, peering     through the half-opened door, is Johan,
shocked at what     he sees. Ben tapes Jonathan on the head,
he pulls up his     shorts painfully, yet fiercely, anxious
to cover himself     up again.
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             We can get a lawyer to appeal.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             A lawyer? That won't heal
             Jonathan's buttocks.
Susan appears at the door.

<b>                           SUSAN
</b>             Ben!
<b>                           BEN
</b>             I'll be out in a minute.

She nods, ushering Johan away from the door back outside.
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             You don't understand, Mister Ben,
             sir. I don't want him to have a
             police record.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                           GORDON  (CONT'D)
</b>             It will be there for  the rest of
             his life and make it  difficult for
             him to get a job in  the future.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             Don't worry, Gordon. I'm sure
             there'll be no record, it's such
             a minor case. Please don't worry.
Ben calls Johan from the outside.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             Johan, get some iodine from the
             cupboard.

Johan rushes in the house.
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             I'm not worried about the wounds.
             They'll heal in time, Mister Ben,
             sir. It's the wounds here.
                    (slaps his chest)
             I worry about. Injustice... it
             festers.
Johan comes back with a small bottle of medicine.
<b>                           BEN
</b>                    (to Gordon)
             Rub it on the wounds and it will
             help.
<b>EXT. BEN'S GATE - DAY
</b>Ben watches   the black man and his son trudge down the
long drive,   the father's arm on the son's shouldre. At
the foot of   the drive the nose of an exotic Soweto cab
can be seen   waiting... a large butterfly painted on the
hood.

<b>EXT. BEN'S GARDEN - DAY
</b>Ben takes his place at the table.     Susan brings a piece
of boerwors and a mug of beer.

<b>                          SUSAN
</b>             Trouble?
<b>                           BEN
</b>             Jonathan has been caned, by the
             police.
She places the boerwors and the beer before him.

</b>             He probably deserved it.

<b>EXT. SOWETO SCHOOL - SOWETO UPRISING - MORNING
</b>School grounds of the Orlando Secondary School. Students
are milling around in high spirits. One group is putting
finishing touches to a banner reading: "no to aparhteid
education."
There are two other banners being carried around the
school yard, followed by the younger children. They
read:
             "No to the Oppressor's language"
             "Bantu education is slave
             education."
A BOY, one of the eldest, aged about 18 years calls for
silence. The STUDENTS immediately obey.
<b>                           STUDENT LEADER (BOY)
</b>             You all know why we are going to
             march.
The crowd shouts:
<b>                           STUDENTS
</b>             'No to Bantu education'
             'No to apartheid'
             'Freedom Now'...
<b>                           STUDENT LEADER
</b>             There must be discipline. We
             start marching from here and we'll
             join up with the others at the
             main road. Please take care of
             the younger ones. Let's go.
The Students start marching led by one of the banners,
singing a freedom song.

Amongst them is Jonathan and Wellington. They are sing-
ing. The march turns round one of the streets.

<b>CROSSROAD
</b>
Several groups of students marchers converge to join the
march that has already started, including Jonathan's
group. There are several banners condeming Bantu
education, apartheid, etc.

<b>                                                (CONTINUED)

</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>Examples:    "EQUAL EDUCATION NOW"
<b>             "ONE MAN ONE VOTE"
</b><b>             "FREE OUT LEADERS"
</b><b>             "NO TO THE AFRIKAANS LANGUAGE"
</b>There are chants of slogans as they march:

<b>                          STUDENTS
</b>            'If we learn Afrikaans vorster
            must learn Zulu.' 'Bantu
            education! Stinks! Stinks!
            Stinks!' 'Equal education! Now!
            Now! Now!'
They also start singing a freedom song.

<b>FURTHER UP STREET
</b>Three police Jeeps block the route of the march. A
little distance behind are police troops carriers
('hippos'). About six police-dog-handlers in camouflage
uniforms stand across the road waiting for the march to
approach.

As the march gets closer the students' singing increases
in volume.
The Soweto   police COMMANDANT steps forward with a loud-
speaker in   hand.  He confronts the lead of the march. He
signals for   them to stop. The dogs are straining at their
leashes and   their handlers taunt the leading group.
<b>                          COMMANDANT
</b>            Now listen to me, this is an
            illegal demonstration. I order
            you to disperse immediately.

The Students start singing the African national anthem
'Nkosi Sikelele.'
Children of 8, 9, 10 years singing lustily with their
fists clenched as everyone else.
Jonathan and Wellington singing.

Camouflauged police scrambling out of Jeeps with guns and
tear gas grenades. They stand with the rifles pointing
at the marchers. The singing continues.
The Commandant confers with a junior officer who hurries
to the group of policemen and gives them instructions.
The ones carrying tear gas move towards front. The
police start donning gas masks.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                           COMMANDANT
</b>             This is the last warning.
             Disperse immediately or I will
             take action.
A voice in the crowd shouts "Banutu education..."

The crowd shouts back "Stinks, Stinks, Stinks."
The Commandant gives a hand signal.

Tear gas canisters are thrown into the crowd, the dog-
handlers attack. There is panic with Students running in
all directions, several choking.

Some of the students start throwing stones at the police,
hitting one in the face; he is helped away by a black
policeman.
Without warning, SHOOTING STARTS.
Children drop, wounded; friends trying to help the dying

Some boys appear with dustbin lids as protection and they
pelt the police with stones.
The police in the 'hippos' are jumping off and pursuing
Students, some SHOOTING.
Woman grabs two of the running children age about 9/10
and hustles them into house.
Jonathan and Wellington are running with      a group.  In the
distance the sound of an AMBULANCE SIREN.       A Jeep cuts
off their escape, they turn back running      as SHOTS are
FIRED towards them, a little girl drops,      shot in the
back. Jonathan shouts to Wellington who       is ahead of him.
<b>                            JONATHAN
</b>             Wellington!   Wellington!

Wellington looks back, sees Jonathan trying to help the
little girl. He runs back to help. Another girl, aged
about 17 years, is also trying to help.

Two policemen suddenly appear from behind a house, they
are about 18 years old.
The girl straightens up and confronts the two policemen
shouting hysterically.

<b>                            GIRL

Jonathan, Wellington and the Girl are hustled into a
crowded van amid punches and kicks from the police. The

neighbors run to assist the Girl.

As the van is passing, see a burning car, in the distance
a building on fire; another AMBULANCE SIREN.

The conversations in the carriage become muted and serious.

The train enters Soweto, there is smoke hanging over sev-
eral parts of the township, and official buildings are on
fire.

Suddenly, the passengers are gripped by the seriousness of
the situation.
There are snatches of conversation such as:

             "That's the superintendent's office
             on fire."
             "I hope the children are home."

A small three-room Soweto brick house -- The living room
is modestly furnished.
EMILY, Gordon's 40-year-old wife, is sitting on a narrow
iron bedstead against the wall, clutching her youngest
2-year-old son -- Her mind is preoccupied. Sitting next
to her is a ten-year-old daughter.
Gordon is sitting on a chair at the table with his second
eldest son, Robert -- aged 14 years -- standing by the
side of the table -- sitting on an old easy chair is a
Soweto resident with his 15-year-old DAUGHTER standing
beside him.

</b>A white-uniformed assistant leads a line of African
parents, reeking of sadness, into a cool room where metal
drawers open from the walls.
Stanley and JULIUS their black lawyer -- the two men seem
to be very well-known, people shake hands with them,
salute them --

Gordon and Emily's sadness is tinged with anger -- they
have dignity, defiance, bowed with grief as they are.

Stanley's large hand is placed gently on Emily's shoulder
as they examine the dead faces before them.
They belong to children, some    in torn, dirty clothes,
others naked, some mutilated,    others whole and seemingly
unharmed, as if asleep, until    the small, neat hole in
temple or chest and the small    crust of blood is brought
to our attention.

A woman behind them starts to scream. They look around
to see her holding onto a drawer, her legs buckling.
Another woman pulls her close to grieve with her. The
assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he
writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body. The
woman can't, won't leave her dead child. Her friend has
to pull her away.

out to touch her.

Gordon looks into the last drawer, Jonathan is not there.

of mourning women sitting.

<b>EXT. MORTUARY - DAY
</b>Gordon, Emily and their friends cross to Stanley's great
white elderly Dodge, this "etembalami" with the big butter-
fly. For, amongst other things, he is the owner and
driver of a pirate taxi.
They get in. Stanley pauses -- looks across at a small
red VW Beetle parked nearby, waiting. He shakes his
head -- the VW flashes its lights and drives off.

</b>            Dear Sirs,
            With reference to your enquiry seeking the
            whereabouts of Jonathan Ngubene, we are sorry
            to inform you we have no record of anyone of
            that name...

   At the back of police headquarters, John Vorster Square.
   An elderly black cleaner, emptying garbage, is being
   shown Jonathan's photograph. He looks -- and nods --
   pointing down as meaning the basement.

          Oh... Right... put them through.
          Hallo! Yes! How are you?...
          that is correct.

He listens -- his face slowly becoming solemn --

</b>          Very well. Thank you for finally
          letting us know.

<b>INT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - STAFF ROOM - DAY
</b>Tea break for the teachers, Ben       among them. He is enjoy-

we should hear the language here       where we need not com-
prehend. An African serves the        tea.
There's a KNOCK -- a monitor comes in and talks to Ben

... Cries and whistles rise through the still, warm air
from a game of schoolboy rugby being played below us by
immaculately-fitted teams.

On another part of the field Gordon's lawnmower off to
the side -- two figures pace -- slowly -- one white, one
black --
 A VOICE overlays all this... strange... ironically
African.
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             Mister Ben, sir. If it was me,
             all right. And if it was Emily,
             all right. We are not young. But
             he's out child. My time and your
             time, it's passing. But the time
             of our children is coming. And
             now if they kill our children --

             I... We can't change it.
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             That day, Mr. Ben, sir, when they
             whipped Jonathan, you also said we
             can do nothing. But if we had...
             if someone heard what we had to say
             this would not have happened.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             It's a terrible thing, Gordon --
             God knows I'm sorry. But you have
             other children to live for... I'll
             help them too with their schooling.

             the day of the riots.

<b>                            GORDON
</b>             That's what  they say. But I got
             to know for  certain. How can I
             have peace?   I must know how my
             son died and  where they buried
             him.

The game on the next pitch finishes with a pierce of the
whistle. The kids run off past Ben and Gordon. Gordon
climbs onto the small lawn mower and STARTS the ENGINE.
<b>                            BEN

             I cannot stop before I know what
             happened and where he lies. His
             body belongs to Emily and me.
And drives away -- chugging across the field... leaving
Ben -- helpless -- behind him -- watching.
From his:

in the school behind -- a worried headmaster watches.
We hear his voice over.

And drives off, leaving Ben watching him, shaking his
head at the man's obtuseness.
<b>EXT. NGUBENE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>Emily is watering a tiny vegetable plot in the yard, with
a bucket and a pierced tin.
Robert is playing nearby with the youngest child.
Robert sees Gordon walking slowly to their house and says
playfully to the baby:
<b>                           ROBERT
</b>             Look who's coming? It's baba!
Emily turns to look. She immediately realizes that some-
thing is wrong. She drops the tin and walks a few steps
toward the gate.

Gordon sees her and stops.
Emily starts to break down.

<b>                           EMILY
</b>             Oh, no... oh no, Lord.
Gordon hurries to embrace her.

Gordon starts to lead her to the house.

Margaret, Emily's neighbor, comes, hurries, helps her,
comforts her, escorting them to the house.

shouts back greeting.

Wellington comes to the car.   He's limping, wearing
sunglasses.
As he's approaching the car, Stanley opens the back door
for him.

He enters and removes the glasses.
Stanley notices a deep scar from the forehead to the
cheek.

the end of his nose.
Emily is sitting by the stove.      Robert stands beside her
chair, watching, listening.
The youngsters are sleeping in opposite directions on the
iron bed.

Wellington is sitting beside Gordon at the table. There
is something wild in his manner. He looks everywhere as
if he is scared of being attacked unawares.

table. Gordon is reading aloud from a handwritten
document.

             crying, and then a noise like
             tables and chairs being knocked
             down, and Capt. Stolz shouting
             "you bastard, get up, do you hear
             me?" Ngubene, don't pretend here,
             get up." Then the next day I
             heard he had gone to hospital and
             I never saw him again.'
There's a long silence. Gordon closes his eyes and
struggles with his grief. Emily sobs, Robert looks on
in anger. Then, finally, Gordon offers a pen to
Wellington, who is about to sign the foot of the state-
ment, when...

... Suddenly there   is the sound of a TRUCK APPROACHING.
Wellington rushes   to the front window and peers outside;
then panics, fear   in his eyes, he runs into a bedroom and
jumps through the   window.

Everyone in the room is bewildered.
The front door bursts open. Emily sits impassively look-
ing at the five policemen (two whites and three Africans).

The youngest child startled from his sleep starts to cry.
Emily goes to the bed and picks the child up and returns
to her chair.

He notices the papers on the table and picks them up.        He
looks at them and realizes their importance.

Capt. Stolz walks into the room and surveys the room and
its occupants. Lieutenant Venter hands him the papers.
He goes through them, nodding to himself as he reads
silently. He folds them neatly and puts them into his
inside jacket pocket. He walks up to Gordon.

<b>                           STOLZ

Gordon doesn't answer.
He turns to the cleaner who automatically stands.
<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             We know each other, don't we?

Calmly, he paces round the room looking around, then when
he reaches the bed where the 10-years-old girl is watch-
ing terrified, he pulls off the blankets, yanks the girl
off the bed by her arm and frantically searches the bed.
The child cries. Robert the brother goes to his sister
and hugs her as he glares at Stolz with anger and hatred.

The other policeman appears from the other bedrooms empty-
handed. Gordon and the cleaner are roughly handled as
they are handcuffed by the African Security Police.

Over his shoulder Gordon manages to give Emily one last
look, as he's hustled out of the house.

<b>INT. BEN'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
Behind Ben's house, are the servants' quarters attached
to the garage.
Ben has adapted what would have been a maid's room into
his study and the adjoining room into a do-it-yourself
workshop.
The study has photographs of Ben's past as a provincial
rugby player, of his family, school staff and TRECHIKOFF
reproduction.
On a cupboard are trophies of individual sports at
university.
He works off a plain desk on which is a handsome pipe-
rack with several pipes. His indulgence is a comfortable
easy chair.
Ben's study, containing only the figure of Ben. He's
hunched over his desk, looking blankly at the newspaper.
His shirt is unbuttoned, his jacket slung across his
chair. He draws heavily on his pipe, wreathing his
head with smoke in the beam of the single desk light.
He sits in his chair:

Gordon's voice rises in his thoughts.
<b>                           GORDON (V.O.)

             witness today: I must know what

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>Johan is entering, knocking on the half-open door. He's
in his pajamas and dressing gown, ready for bed. Ben
looks up at him. Johan kisses his father who suddenly
clasp his son hard, clinging to him for dear life.
The boy throws his arms around his dad's neck.

<b>                             JOHAN

Susan appears at the door with a cup of coffee. She's
had a bath -- her hair is wet -- and she's in her
housecoat.
Ben and Johan don't notice her approach.

She watches sympathetically for a moment, then...

As Susan rests the cup of coffee on the desk before Ben.
She notices the Rand Daily Mail.

and kisses her.

tractor sitting in the field.
He turns back   and notices a boy focusing on the ceiling.
His pen in his   mouth, trying desperately to find the
answers. Ben    has a smile, then crosses to him, bends down
and strikes a   similar pose.
The class breaks up into laughter.

Ben appears on the other side of the veranda. He is in
Cloete's company -- the little big man... grey hair...
65 years old. The headmaster.

They stop in before Ben's colleague, Vivier, passing,
shakes hands with him. A woman arrives and waits. Cloete
says something to Ben, then laughs.

fag-end of cigarette from his lips and stubs it on
Gordon's neck.

bag.

is brought in held on both sides by two white policemen.
She is taken into a lift.
Ben watches them enter the lift and follows the progress

             worthy pursuit of the guilty you
             have, unwittingly, involved the
             innocent. After all, we're all

Viljoen laughs again.

</b>Gordon is undoing his trousers.
Venter roughly drops the trousers and pushing him to the
floor.
He handcuffs him while Johannes pulls off the trousers
and underpants, and manacles his ankles.
Johannes fetches a rod.
Venter goes to a cupboard, pulls out two electric wires
with electrodes attachments and places them on the desk.
All the preparation is done with practiced efficiency.
From the adjoining room there are angry shouts of a
woman.

Venter and Johannes place the rod between Gordon's elbow-
joints and the back of his knees. The door opens.
Gordon has a look of terror on his face.

Dominee Bester is preaching from the pulpit.
<b>                           BESTER
</b>             God created the whole human race
             so that they could occupy the
             entire earth. He decreed how
             long each nation should flourish,
             and what the boundaries of each
             territory should be. Our task is
             to preserve that creative diversity.
Behind him, in his deacon's black tails, Ben listens with
clasped hands. On the opposite side, another man is lis-
tening, standing in the love of his family, Cloete.
<b>                           BESTER
</b>             Brothers and sisters, like our
             forebears, the Voortrekkers, who
             trekked into the wilderness
             preserve the Afrikanere way of
             life given to them by God. Today,
             we also live in times of great
             danger. Let not fear overcome
             you! Cling to the ways of justice
             and truth preserved by our leaders.
             So shall God be honored...
<b>BEN'S POV

The faces    of his friends scattered among the pews, Suzette
and Susan    listening intently, Johan beside her visibly
bored, his    eyes wandering to the Cloete's daughter at
the end of    the pew.

<b>                           STANLEY
</b>             They didn't tell her. She heard
             it on the radio like the rest of
             us. I contacted Lewinson
             immediately. He then rung the
             police to ask why Emily wasn't
             informed. Would you believe it,
             they said they were sorry, and they
             didn't know where to contact her.
Ben walks slowly out of the garage in deep thoughts --

             We are now about to leave the
             white jungle and entering the land
             of love and glory.
The car approaches a huge perimeter notice:

<b>"YOU ARE NOW ENTERING SOWETO TOWNSHIP.    NO PERSON WITHOUT
</b><b>THE NECESSARY PERMIT IS ALLOWED..."
</b>
Ben is driven into a different world; children playing in
dirty streets, in wrecks of cars, open spaces devoid of
vegetables, smoke from large rubbish dumps, burnt-out
skeletons of buses, beer halls and buildings. Clusters
of policemen in battle dress patrolling in the distance.
<b>                           BEN

             But watch out for the police and
             army. They're patrolling all the
             time.

The car follows an isolated broken stretch of tarred road
hill cluttered with rusty tins, cardboard containers,
bottles.

<b>EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
</b>A group of young children playing under the blinding sun
in a muddy ditch, notice the big painted butterfly on the
hood of Stanley's car.
They wave and scream at Stanley in their language and he
screams back at them.

Two little girls start running, heading toward the car.
Stanley notices the red VW parked in a corner. He man-
euvers and parks his car nearby.

<b>                           STANLEY

<b>BEN'S POV
</b>A modern funeral parlor with its name painted on the side:
<b>"MOROKA FUNERAL DIRECTOR (PTY) LTD."
</b>
<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>Stanley notices the two little girls with dusty smiling
faces, standing there waiting for him.

<b>                           STANLEY
</b>                    (checking his pants'
                     pockets)
             No sweets today. I'm sorry,
             babies.
The children give Stanley a coy disbelieving look as they
watch him go with the "white man."

<b>CHILDREN'S POV
</b>On the doorstep of the funeral parlor: Stanley and Ben
run into a young woman coming out with a shoulder bag
and a camera.
The young woman and Stanley exchange a quick, friendly
greeting -- it's MELANIE BRUWER, the Rand Daily reporter
-- and keep moving.
<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Ben turns back for a moment. Her face seems familiar to
him. He would like to talk to her, but there is no time.
Stanley is already inside.
<b>INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
</b>Ben and Stanley follow the proprietor who is expensively-
dressed in a dark suit. Gordon's coffin stands as one of
many in the room.
Inside the casket, brass fittings, white satin, lies
Gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black Sunday suit.
His hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a
bird and his face, barely recognizable, is gray, the left
side distorted, blackish purple.

There are rough stitches of the postmortem across his
skull and a scar on his lips.
Stanley speaks in an African language to the undertaker.
The man opens Gordon's shirt and reveals the bruised and
battered chest.

</b>
Stanley observes Ben who looks at the wounds with horror.
<b>
</b>Then another command from Stanley and the undertaker
opens the shirt to the waist. Ben's ashen. Stanley
thanks the man and turns to leave. Ben remains a minute.
He shuts his eyes tightly. Now he saw it. Now he must
believe it. He must accept that this battered corpse is
Gordon.
As he follows Stanley, he thanks the undertaker.

<b>EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
</b>
Outside the "sunlight," the children's laughter and
Stanley, hands in pockets, waiting for Ben by the car.

The same two little girls approach Stanley who gives them
some coins -- they run off happily.
Ben is coming outside blinking in the glaring sunlight.
Stanley glares at Ben, who is pale, shaken and silent.
They get into the car in silence.
<b>                        STANLEY

Stanley starts the car.

Stanley looks at him.
<b>                        STANLEY

Stanley turns his RADIO ON and BANTU MUSIC invades the
car as it speeds away in a cloud of dust.
<b>EXT. WHITE SUBURB STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>The big brassy Dodge is threading its way through the
leafy calm of the white suburb.

The "Bantu" MUSIC is STILL PLAYING on the radio under
Stanley's animated conversation with Ben.

<b>                           STANLEY
</b>             You know, Lanie, when you run a
             taxi, especially a pirate taxi
             like me, you have eyes and ears
             everywhere. Even when a policeman
             farts in his bed you know. People
             want a reference book, a permit to
             stay in Soweto, a house, anything,
             we taxi drivers know the routes.
             I'll tell you something...

A news bulletin in African language interrupts the music.

<b>EXT. SOWETO CEMETERY - MORNING
</b>The large Soweto cemetery has scores of graves ready for
burials. The chief mourners, Emily, Robert, his sister,
Margaret, four relatives and Stanley are standing on
either side of the PRIEST. Gordon's coffin is in the
grave; several wreaths are on the side of the grave.

There are about fifteen hundred mourners, and half are
youths. There are several local reporters and overseas
television reporters.
The police are in attendance in large numbers at the edge
of the crowd, some in battle dress and some with dogs.
<b>                        PRIEST
</b>          Before I conclude, I have to say
          we are tired of making this
          journey every day, sometimes twice
          in one day, burying our children,
          and those, like our departed
          brother, Ngubene who were merely
          seeking the truth; and those who
          have been denounced by traitors
          amongst us; and those who have
          been brutally killed for no
          reason, yes I shall say it, by the
          police. Let those who rule this
          land of ours listen to the word
          of God; let them listen to our
          peaceful and just demands; let
          them be humble and go down on
          their knees and seek forgiveness,
          then listen to God.
The crowd roars:   "Amanda!   Amanda!"
The Priest starts a short hymn and the crowd joins in.

At the end of the hymn.
<b>                        PRIEST
</b>          We will have a few words from Mr.
          Pilani our father and leader.
The crowd starts singing a freedom song with arms raised.
The funeral has now become a political demonstration.

Mr. Pilani, who is a dignified, educated 70-years-old,
walks slowly and waits beside the chief mourners. He
is handed a loudspeaker.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER threads his way through the
crowd, a loud hailer in his hand. As he reaches the
grave he turns. The crowd is quiet. He says something
to the Priest then addresses the crowd.
<b>                           SENIOR OFFICER
</b>             The funeral is over. I order
             everyone to go home. This is not
             a political rally. I repeat,
             disperse.

As though by signal the police start attacking the
mourners with truncheons and dogs. There is pandemon-
ium, women screaming, people falling into graves or
covering in them.

The Priest and Stanley lead Emily and the family away
in the opposite direction.
The press and television are recording the scene. The
police start throwing tear gas canisters. There is no
confrontation, the crowd is fleeing in all directions.
One television cameraman is purposely pushed into a grave
by a very young policeman, his round recordist is pulled
up into the adjourning grave by the connecting cord.
Melanie stands on a tombstone watching and making notes.

</b>Stanley and Ben are driving in the outskirts of
Johannesburg.

<b>EXT. APPROACHES OF SOWETO - AFTERNOON
</b>Stanley drives seemingly alone at very high speeds, which
he maintains through the streets of Soweto... using his
horn to scatter people out of his way, to the anger and
indulgence of others.

The CAR SCREECHES to a halt outside Emily's house.
Stanley gets out of the car and greets the startled
neighbors... and acknowledges the friendly shouts of
children.

Stanley looks around, then goes back to the car, opens
the back door, leans and says something. Suddenly, to
everyone's astonishment, Ben crawls out of the car;
Stanley hustles him into Emily's house.

Stanley waves at the people, a sign of assurance, then
closes the door behind him.

<b>INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</b>Ben stands awkwardly for a moment, taking in the room and
the people in it. He then walks over to Emily who is
standing at the table. He goes to shake her hand.

relaxed and loving.

Ben talks quietly and calmly.
<b>                        BEN
</b>          I think I am without awareness.
          I have always cared about people,
          call it a social conscience. But
          my visit to Gordon's house made me
          experience another dimension of

<b>INT. COURT ROOM - FIRST DAY OF INQUEST - DAY
</b>The inquest of Gordon Ngubene... conducted by MAGISTRATE
KLOPPER. In the witness box is DR. JANSEN, the state
pathologist, giving evidence. Advocate DE VILLIERS is
cross examining.
<b>                        DE VILLIERS
</b>          Dr. Jansen, you are a state
          pathologist of many years
          standing and I have no doubt a
          well-qualified pathologist.
          Could you now please tell us
          what caused the death of the
          deceased?
<b>                        DR. JANSEN
</b>          I found that death had been caused
          by the application of force to
          the neck, consistent with
          hanging.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>There's a vigorous reaction to this around the court,
which gives us a chance to discover the crowd:

In the white section of the public gallery are Ben and
about eight other whites.

The black section is filled to capacity with a few stand-
ing. In the front row is sitting Stanley next to
Margaret. At the entrance, a white policeman.
In the press section are several reporters; amongst them
Melanie Bruwer the Rand Daily Mail reporter.
Colonel Viljoen and several policemen are sitting around
the court.

<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             You are sure about the hanging?
             This pressure on the neck, could
             it also have been exerted in other
             ways?
<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             It could, but it is not for me
             to speculate.
<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             Of course not, Doctor. The list
             of injuries found on the body was
             horrifyingly long; bruises,
             swellings, abrasions, broken rib,
             lacerations, etc. How long before
             death do you estimate he received
             these injuries?
<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             I couldn't say exactly.

<b>                          DE VILLIERS
</b>             Roughly.

<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             Some were fourteen to twenty days
             old, others three to four days and
             others even more recent.

<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             Even more recent. I see. I
             understand you had a Dr. Hassiem
             present at the autopsy.

<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             That's correct.

</b>             Isn't it normal practice to have
             one report? Why did Dr. Hassiem
             decide to draw up a separate
             report? If he really co-signed
             yours.

<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             That's for him to answer!
<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             I would very much like to, Dr.
             Jansen, but he's been detained --
             you know of course that he

         against him. It was the day before
         his death. The deceased suddenly
         showed signs of aggression. He
         tried to jump through the open

         six of my men to restrain him,
         and he had to be manacled hand
         and foot, for his own safety.
         But once he calmed down, he was
         ready to make a statement about

<b>                           EMILY
</b>             Captain Stolz lied. My husband
             never fight the police when he
             was arrested. They were rough
             with him, pushing him and
             threatening.

             were they?
<b>                           EMILY
</b>             There was blood on them and in

             broken teeth.
<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             Now Mrs. Ngubene, you have seen
             the note that's said to have been
             written by your husband. Do you
             recognize the writing?

             He never wrote that letter, they
             lie.

             and the one they call Venter. As
             they were searching somebody I
             know, they wanted me to tell them
             where that person was hidden. As
             I refuse to cooperate they beat me
             with a sjambok. After some time
             I fell and they kicked me in the

             twisting it around my neck...
                    (she illustrates)

             They did this several time and

             'come on meid, speak up, or do

</b>             I have listened to all the
             evidence and the arguments. To
             begin with I have to say that
             there was no conclusive evidence
             offered to prove beyond doubt that
             members of the Security Police had
             been guilty of assault or any
             irregular conduct on the deceased.
             There were indications that
             Ngubene was aggressive and on more
             than one occasion had to be
             restrained with force. There was
             sufficient evidence to conclude
             that death had been caused by a
             trauma following pressure applied
             to the neck, consistent with
             hanging. Consequently, I find
             that Gordon Ngubene committed
             suicide by hanging himself and
             that on available evidence his
             death cannot be attributed to any
             act or omission or amounting to
             a criminal offense on the part of
             any person.

<b>EXT. MELANIE'S HOME - DAY
</b>Melanie drives into the yard. The house is an old
Colonial style house amidst flowers, bushes and trees, a
controlled wild garden.
A figure is bent over a beehive. A large brimmed old hat
with a net hides his head and features.
Melanie stops the car in the driveway.

             There he is by the eucalyptus
             tree, on the left. That's old
             Bruwer.

They get out of the car and walk towards him.

</b>             You shut up.
                    (to Ben)
             Let me tell you about bees, and
             for that matter ants: a bee has
             a completely altruistic sense of
             purpose -- based on the common
             good. A course from which he
             cannot be deflected. Greed,
             ambition, they mean nothing to
             him. He lives solely to serve
             his fellow bee.
<b>                           MELANIE
</b>             What about individuality, Dad?
<b>                           BRUWER
</b>             There's the rub, my girl. There's
             the rub. One of these days I'll
             ask the bees. I'm sure they have
             the answer. Now, you two run
             along!

He replaces his net and continues with the hive.
<b>                             MELANIE
</b>             A drink, Dad?

</b>       The Bruwer living room is a profusion of piles of papers,
       of books on shelves, on tables, on the floor, paintings
       -- records, African sculptures.
       On the floor tangled lengths of flex leading from a
       record player to two voluminous speakers.

       A settee, a chess set. The furniture is old and well-
       used, dominated by a large leather club chair -- two
       big cats sleeping on it. It's civilized pandemonium.

       Melanie goes into the kitchen leaving Ben. He cannot

       to Ben.

Coetzee.     He tries to greet her but she walks straight by.

Further on, he notices two men obviously talking about
him. Then a couple of boys on bikes snigger as they
pass him. He begins to wonder what's it all about, and
spontaneously checks his clothes.

<b>EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - VERANDA - MORNING
</b>Susan and Suzette sit there. Suzette's holding a news-
paper -- the Ossewa -- Susan's thoughtful, her face is red
and discomposed -- obviously she had cried. The PHONE
RINGS but they deliberately ignore it.
Ben appears with the newspapers under his arm, sees
Suzette's sports car and hurries to join them.
Suzette doesn't even give him a chance to kiss her.
<b>                           SUZETTE

                     the cover of Ossewa)
             Now, Papa, this is going too
             far! How could you?

<b>                           BEN
</b>                    (surprised)
             How's that, Suzette?

Ben takes the newspaper and looks at the cover. A picture
of himself and Emily outside the courtroom. The two faces
are close together with the notes:

             "EMILY NGUBENE, wife of native who
             died in detention, comforted by a
             friend of family, Mr. BEN DU TOIT."

And in parenthesis "see page two."
He throws the Ossewa on a chair and checks into the Rand
Daily Mail. Inside there is a long article with Emily's
picture, titled "the Face of Grief."

Ben folds up the newspapers, and shakes his head. He
suddenly realizes why the people reacted like that outside.

</b>The farm is a typical transvaal farm covering thousands of
acres.  In the distance there's a range of mountains.
Several cattle are grazing, herded by a poorly-clad African

Bester and Ben are leaning on the wooden fence of the
cattle kraal with calves penned in.

</b>             We are both Boers, Ben. We know
             how hard our people worked to get
             a toehold on this land; it was a
             good life. Now look at the mess.
             It's all systems and no God!
             Sooner or later people start
             believing in their way of life as
             an absolute: unmutable,
             fundamental, a precondition. Saw
             it, with my own eyes in Germany,
             a nation running after an idea.
             Sieg heil, sieg heil. I left
             there thirty years ago because I
             couldn't take it any longer. And
             now I see it happening in my own
             country, step by step.
             Terrifyingly predictable. This
             sickness of the great abstraction.

             someone who is a member of
             Parliament. It's a grievous day
             when one's family's behavior
             comes between him and his duty
             to the fatherland.
<b>                           BEN

             member of our family has been seen
             with a Kaffir woman before, Ben.

Father signals the African waiter for more drinks.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             I am glad you mentioned it, Father.
             Because I'd like to discuss the
             whole thing with you. First,
             there's the matter of Gordon

several GUNSHOTS in the distance. The only light comes
from the small, square windows of the innumerable houses.

chair next to him a black man in a brown striped suit,
drinks orange squash. Thirtyish, pleasant face but very

                 answer. What did help me was my
wanderings in Africa.

<b>                                 BEN
</b>                   How did you manage that on a
                   South African passport? We South
                   Africans are white devils in
                   Africa.

                   So I get a British passport. It
                   comes in handy even for the paper.

</b>                   I wonder what he's doing right
                   now. Most likely standing on a
                   rock, looking through his old
                   binoculars at springbok or a lion
                   or whatever.
      One of the two large CATS approaches them, tail in the
      air, and goes to Melanie, drubbing against her legs,
      PURRING luxuriously. She picks it up into her arms.

<b>EXT. SOWETO - EMILY'S HOUSE - MID-MORNING
</b>Parked outside the house is a municipality truck already
half-laden with Emily's furniture and possessions. Four
Africans in khaki overalls are loading the truck -- super-
vising the eviction of Emily are a white Soweto official,
Captain Stolz and Lt. Venter. In the b.g., a hundred yards
away is a "hippo" with black and white armed policemen.
Behind the truck are two police Land Rovers.

Emily is sitting outside on one of her chairs as neighbors
walk up to her to comfort her and say their goodbyes. Her
daughter is carrying the youngest child and standing next
to Emily -- several children are watching. A woman in
the crowd starts singing a freedom song: "UMZIMA
LOMTHWALO" ("THIS BURDEN IS HEAVY"). The song is taken up
by the other women.

Venter tries to stop them and disperse them. Stolz
signals to him to leave them alone. One of the Africans
then walks up to her for the chair. She refuses to get
off the chair. The man looks at the white official as
though to ask "what do I do." The official looks at
Stolz. Venter walks up to Emily and, about to pull her
off the chair.

<b>                        EMILY
</b>          Don't you touch me!
Venter pulls back. The women start to ululate. Emily
rises majestically, takes the youngest in her arms and
walks slowly to the truck followed by her daughter.
People cluster around her, singing with rage and shaking
her hand. Stolz observes the scene, impassive.
<b>                          WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          Come back!    Buya!

</b>                  (shouts)
          Buya!   Buya!
Emily and the children are helped onto the back of the
truck which drives away preceded by the police "hippo" and
escorted from the rear by the Land Rovers. The crowd
continues singing.

<b>EXT. STREET - MORNING
</b>
Ben is leaving his home. This is a Saturday morning. Two
men are sitting in a car a few yards from the entrance to
the house. Ben doesn't pay attention to them. When he
is about twenty yards past, one of the men, Jaimie -- who
was present when Gordon was arrested -- gets out of the
car and follows Ben. Ben stops at a corner for a car and
again the FOOTSTEPS stop.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>He turns furtively and sees the man, stopped, turning his
head. Ben decides to turn the corner, and listens to the
FOOTSTEPS. The man is still following. Ben then decides
to turn right back to have a good look at the man. They
pass each other and Ben takes a good look at him and turns
back onto the streets to the local shops. The man decides
not to follow.

<b>INT. BEN'S STUDY - NIGHT

             She's a widow, man. That's what
             happens in Soweto when a woman
             loses her man. They throw her out
             of the house and out of the city.
<b>                           BEN
</b>                    (disgusted)
             Zululand! The whole thing smells
             of being an excuse to send her
             hundreds of miles from the case.
             And how will they live there?...
<b>                           STANLEY
</b>             Shit! I was about to find her a
             place, but I had to go to look
             for Robert.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             So, that's why you went to
             Botswana for.
<b>                           STANLEY
</b>             Sis Emily asked me but it was no
             use. His mind was made up. He
             was going to join Wellington in
             Zambia.

<b>                           BEN

Stanley gulps down his whisky and stands up.

outside the house. In it Jaimie and another S.B. They

Stanley walks past his car and approaches the policeman.

</b>                   (using his usual

            Good evening. I'd like to invite
            you into my humble home, but it's
            full of terrorists.

The two policemen get out of their car, obviously angry.

They search and find nothing.
<b>                          JAIMIE

Stanley executes the order. Jaimie and the OTHER POLICE-
MAN peer in, their eyes sweeping the car.

<b>                          OTHER POLICEMAN
</b>            Now, your pass, bliksem.

Stanley   produces his passbook and hands it to the Police-
man who   inspects the pages laboriously, then throws the
book to   the ground. Stanley doesn't pick it up and just
watches   the man.

<b>                          JAIMIE
</b>            You watch your bloody step!     Right?

They return to their car and drive off. Stanley looks at
them thoughtfully, then picks up his book.
<b>EXT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - MORNING

All the students are in classes. Cloete walks        out of a
classroom and sees Capt. Stolz walking towards       the build-
ing. Cloete stops to wait for him. They shake         hands and
walk to Cloete's office talking affably. They        enter

He strides into the dining room.
<b>INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>Susan sits   with her eyes tight shut -- trying to shut out
the horror   of it all. As the Father-in-law goes into
the living   room, he pulls back his wife's chair and helps
her to her   feet.

Chris follows. Susan also. From the living room, she
calls Johan who is left alone at the table, perplexed.
Johan goes to his mother.
There's a general rush for the door and, without warning,
the room is empty. Only the TIN ANGELS TINKLE merrily
around their candles.

breathing heavily.

</b>             Emily dead?   How?   When?
Stanley doesn't answer - he cries.

beside him, shaken, his face ravaged by the news.

Through the window, he sees Suzette and Chris carrying
suitcases, back down the path to his in-laws' car;
Father-In-Law shepherding his wife and an ashen, dazed
Susan, helping them into the car.

As they leave see Johan leaning against the dining room
door, watching his father and Stanley.

             pursue our civil suit. The only

                    (pause)
             That way the world will know the
             brutality and power of our

</b>             You know, Melanie, I'm discovering
             that the enemy is not in Soweto.
             The enemy is ourselves. Our
             bigotry, our laws, our system. We

Melanie jumps off the settee.

</b>             This calls for a drink.    Gin and
             tonic?

<b>                           BEN
</b>             Please.
As Melanie walks away, Ben looks at her with admiration
and tenderness... her dress swinging around her legs...
her bare feet soundless on the floor... the quiet grace
of her movement.
On the way to the kitchen to get the drinks, Melanie goes
to the record player. There's a record already on the
turntable.

Suddenly as if rising from a dream, Ben murmurs:
<b>                            BEN
</b>             Melanie.   Be careful.

                     flippantly)
             Of course, Ben.
She goes into the kitchen.

As Melanie hums to herself to     the BLUES MUSIC, in the
kitchen, Ben walks over to the     window and furtively
glances out, to assure himself     that nobody is watching.
He takes then a book on a pile     next to the settee and
pages slowly through it.
Melanie returns with two glasses, still in her happy
mood. She places Ben's glass on the side table next to
the settee, takes the book from him and makes him sit
down.

Jumping up and taking Ben's glass and placing it on the
side table, she pulls him to his feet.
<b>                           BEN

They laugh as they start to dance to the slow BLUES
MUSIC. The laughing subsides as they hold each other
closer. The dancing starts to lose the beat of the
music. They look into each other's eyes and Ben envel-
ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as
possible against him.
They stop dancing.     Ben kisses her.   A long, warm and
tender kiss.

Ben drops the package he was inspecting, back on the
shelf and pushes his trolley towards the man to try and
see his face.

confront him. Man picks up a pack of ham.
Ben is about to remonstrate with him.

section of the Asian township. He peers around him, then
walks away.
Ben knocks at a door.
The door is opened cautiously by DR. HASSIEM, a tall,
handsome Indian, aged 35 years. His clothes are casual
but expensive. His six-year-old daughter, large dark
eyes, is clinging to his leg. We recognize the little
girl of the photograph near the telephone, from earlier.

             on the facts. After all we
             examined the same body in the same
             time. But just on the
             interpretation. For example, if
             Gordon, had really been hanged,
             the marks on his throat would have
             been concentrated on the front.

             You see, through a misunderstanding
             I arrived at the morgue too early
             for the autopsy. There wasn't a
             soul around except a young African
             attendant. When I told him I'd
             come for the autopsy, he let me in.
             The body was on the table dressed.
             I noticed blood on the clothes.

             closely, a police-officer came in
             and said I wasn't allowed in the
             morgue before Dr. Jansen arrived.
             When I returned with Dr. Jansen,
             half an hour later, the body was
             naked.

             testified that Capt. Stolz ordered
             him to burn the clothes.

him. He gets up from the chair, walks to the window,
glances through it, then steps to look at some family
photographs on the mantlepiece. Amongst them a photograph
of Dr. Hassiem before "Big Ben." Dr. Hassiem returns
with a file, the daughter still following.

<b>INT. JAN SMUTS AIRPORT - DAY
</b>Ben and Johan are standing in the public enclosure on the
top floor of the airport building. Ben is unshaved, he
looks tired, but happy. There is the usual bustle of
airport staff for the steps and luggage, two-thirds of
the staff being black.

Passengers emerge from the plane Melanie amongst them.
Some waving to friends and relatives on the public en-
closure. Melanie stops momentarily and looks up at the
enclosure. She sees Ben and Johan and waves at them.
They wave back and Ben indicates they'll be waiting for
her below. She walks off as they happily await her after
the ususal formalities.
<b>INT. JAN SMUTS AIRPORT - DAY

Ben and Johan are waiting outside the arrivals exit.
Several passengers stream out, some being met. Eventually
there is a trickle of passengers. An INDIAN WOMAN is one
of the last to come out. Ben approaches her.
<b>                        BEN

          with a red dress. Are there still,

<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             Word came to me that you were
             asking after your very good friend,
             Miss Bruwer. You know, subersives
             come in all guises and can be
             very resourceful. Now let's take
             your friend, she has been using
             her privilege as a journalist to
             endanger the security of this
             country. But you know something
             else? She has been secretly
             holding a British passport. A
             South African passport and a
             British pasport. Now you tell me,
             where is her patriotism? Her
             allegiance? The minister telexed
             to the immigration officers here
             declaring her an undesirable
             immigrant. So she is being put
             on the first available plane to
             London. This must be heart-
             breaking for you. Good afternoon,
             Meneer Du Toit, Johan.

Ben and Johan arriving at the house. An unsympathetic
small crowd is there waiting... They react, murmuring
in Afrikaans, watching them with hostility as Ben and
Johan get out of the car and discover the chaos. The
wreckage. The garage and Ben's study have been bombed.
Johan leaves Ben and rushes to the house. The crowd
starts to disperse.
The entire    tools cupboard has been methodically ripped
apart and    the contents strewn on the garage floor.
Everything    is half-burnt... charred... Ben has sunk onto
the stool    in total defeat. There's silence.
Then Johan appears at the door. He hands Ben a large
envelope -- in it, the file with all the papers. Ben looks
up at Johan.

Ben starts putting material relevent to his inquiries
into a large brown envelope.

Johan enters kitchen with a large envelope and hands it
to his father.

terrified.

             found him. She's being deported.
             The official reason is that she
             possessed a British passport. I
