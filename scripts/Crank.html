          he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds
          him up and shoves him away.

          tosses it into the sink. He's visibly fading.
<b>          
</b>          ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little
          plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to CHEV. The
          bag hits CHEV square in the forehead, hits sweat and STICKS.
          CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the
          floor. His reflexes are not the best at this point.
<b>          
</b>          CHEV collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it
          right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. The

          steadies himself. A new man.

               buckshot, pelting the COP. CHEV does a 360 DEGREE BURNOUT,
               kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then
               jerking, skidding, BLASTS OFF. The COP hangs on, cursing,
