<b>1   INT. AIRPLANE - DAY                                        1
</b>    On a chartered plane flying from Miami to Newark Airport.
    JACK is the captain. His copilot PAUL is seated beside
    him. In the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is
    celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the Miami
    team. They are singing, dancing in the aisles and
    drinking champagne.

    In the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass-
    engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to
    be a BUSINESSMAN.
    The plane is flying over the coastline.
    The partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin
    is open. Jack is very excited. He can't stop turning
    around to look at the passengers.
<b>                             JACK
</b>                      (to Paul)
               Oh my God! I can't believe my
               eyes! Look at these women! Will
               you look at the gorgeous calves on
               them?! I'm telling you, give me
               an athlete any day... Oh God!
               Look at that redhead over there,
               and look at that one! Christ,
               I hadn't noticed her.
                      (miming a heart
                       attack)
               Paul, I've just fallen madly in
               love with the most beautiful
               woman in the world...
<b>                             PAUL
</b>                      (totally
                       uninterested)
               Oh yeah? Which one?
<b>                             JACK
</b>                      (as though about
                       to keel over)
               The blonde over there, she's too
               gorgeous for words. Just look at
               those eyes, look at those
               shoulders and the way she moves.
               I'm in love. Here, take over,
               I'll be right back.

Jack gets up and Paul takes his place at the controls.
Jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who
are blocking the way, to the object of his affections.
She is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing
her head off. Jack leans over and whispers, quickly and
intensely, to her.
<b>                         JACK
</b>          Hello.   I'm the captain of this
          plane.   May I ask your name?
<b>                        GIRL
</b>          Sure, my name is Jane.    Why?
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Listen, Jane, I've seen many
          beautiful women in my life but I
          swear to you, I've never, ever
          met a woman as exquisite as you
          are.
Jack kneels down before her, and the Girl looks at him,
amused. He takes her hand and places it over his heart.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Jane, can you feel my heart? It's
          pounding. This is horrible, I
          think I'm gonna faint. Listen: I'm
          madly in love with you, I'm single
          and here's my phone number.
He hands her his business card.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          I'm putting my fate in your hands.
          If you don't call me, you'll make
          me the most miserable man on earth.
          This is no line and I'm not trying
          to get you into bed. This is
          something completely different. I
          love you Jane and if you call me I'll
          be the happiest man in the entire
          universe -- this is 'love at first
          sight.' Out of all these beautiful
          women I noticed only you, and...
The Girl laughs as Jack goes on. Meanwhile, the Busi-
nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has
gotten up and walked over to Jack.
<b>                          BUSINESSMAN
</b>          Are you Paul?
<b>                        JACK
</b>          No, I'm not.

          My name's Jack and I live in a
          fabulous apartment in Manhattan
          overlooking the park and...
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          But you're the pilot, aren't you?

<b>                        JACK
</b>          Yes, I'm the pilot...
                 (to Jane)
          ... I'm not even asking for your
          phone number...
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          Isn't there a pilot whose name is
          Paul?

<b>                        JACK
</b>                 (annoyed)
          Yeah, the copilot -- he's up
          front...
The Businessman disappears in the direction of the
cockpit.
<b>                         JACK
</b>                  (back to Jane)
          I'm leaving it all up to you,
          Jane, but if you do give me
          your phone number, then Jane,
          then...
The Businessman has reached the cockpit.
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>                 (in a low tone)
          Are you Paul?
<b>                        PAUL
</b>                 (turning around
                  nervously)
          Yeah... Are you Jim?
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          Yeah.
He hands Paul a man's purse.
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          Here's your cash.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          What about the stuff?
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          I don't have it. We've got
          problems. Too much heat. Too

          risky. We think the cops are
          on to us.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Whadda ya mean us?   You mean me?

<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          I mean shut up and listen. Two
          guys will be waiting for you in
          a black T-Bird, expecting the
          dope. Just ignore them. It'll
          be delivered to you on Sunday
          and picked up the following
          Thursday, okay?
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          But I won't be home, I'll be in
          the air for two weeks.
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          That's your problem. Make
          arrangements, a deal's a deal.
          Got it!?
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Got it.
Jack returns.
<b>                        JACK
</b>                 (bursting with
                  excitement)
          I got her phone number!   She gave
          me her phone number!
<b>                        BUSINESSMAN
</b>          That's some magnificent view,
          isn't it?
<b>                        JACK
</b>          It's wonderful -- Life is
          wonderful!
The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs
hold of the microphone.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          This is your captain speaking. In
          honor of your victory, in honor of
          your beauty, and in honor of Jane,
          the most beautiful gymnast I have
          ever met. I'm going to give you a
          little demonstration of aviation
          gymnastics -- reserved only for the
          most important guest, hip, hip...
Everyone shouts "HOORAY!" except for Paul and the

    Businessman, who remain grim.
    Jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the
    cliffs along the coast. It is a beautiful, impressive
    stunt. There are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the
    passengers.


<b>2   INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY              2
</b>    Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves
    with her teammates. Jane finds it all very funny, but
    Jack looks totally wretched seeing her go.
    Jack and Paul walk toward the exit.

<b>                            JACK
</b>              God, what a woman!
    Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.
<b>                            JACK
</b>              Wanna share a cab?
                               Paul
              Yeah, sure!
    A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver
    looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him.
<b>                            JACK
</b>              She's so beautiful! I've never
              been so in love before. Can you
              believe she gave me her phone
              number... Oh, Christ -- where is
              it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I
              lost it... It's a matter of life
              and death... Oh here it is --
              thank God!
    All the while    Jack has been rambling on, a beige car
    on the other    side of the street has slowed down. Paul
    notices it.     In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON,
    is behind the    wheel with one of his colleagues sitting
    beside him.
<b>                            GRATON
</b>              They're slowing down.    Take a
              picture.
    The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to
    be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul.
    The black Ford pulls out. The beige car follows it.
    Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye.
<b>                            PAUL
</b>              Listen, I need a favor, I got

</b>
          a little problem.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Yeah, sure... Hey, look, will you
          -- look at that sparkling beauty.

A very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with
cart overflowing with luggage. One of them falls off.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Yeah... I mean, it's like...
          There's this little package...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          She'll never make it with all
          that luggage she's got. I gotta
          give her a hand. Look at the
          colors in her hair! Christ, I've
          never seen a woman like her
          before...
He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Jack, listen, can I...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Sure you can, no problem...
          Listen, I gotta go now, I'm
          gonna see if she'll share a cab
          with me.  You take the shuttle,
          okay?
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          But I gotta explain to you
          about...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Come over to my place tonight.
          We're having a huge party. Come
          around 9, okay? See ya later.

Jack races toward the woman and begins to help her
with the fallen luggage. We see him talking to her
and we can hear a little of what he's saying.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          As exquisite as you are...
          I think I'm gonna faint.
He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart.
The young woman is flabbergasted.
A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus.

<b>3   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                    3
</b>    A large, stylishly decorated apartment in Manhattan.
    A tremendous living room. A party's going on. Very
    LOUD JAZZ is PLAYING. The lights are dim. There are
    about 30 guests. Lots of young pretty women. Gourmet
    buffet. People are sitting on couches talking, others
    are eating, drinking or dancing. In a dimly-lit corner,
    Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair.
    She is laughing as she listens to him.
<b>                             JACK
</b>                     (whispering
                      passionately)
              This is no line and I'm not
              trying to get you into bed. This
              is something completely different.
              This is 'love at first sight.'
              Oh, I'm so happy... Let me go get
              you a glass of champagne. I'll
              be right back.
    Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as
    he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running
    toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he
    passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement
    conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA.
    They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy-
    ing it.
<b>                            SOPHIA
</b>              Are you saying that's art, are
              you really saying that's art?
              Well then you explain why.
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>              It goes back to prehistoric man.
              They had comic strips on their
              walls, for God's sake.
<b>                            JACK
</b>                     (whispering
                      in Michael's
                      ear)
              I'm having a hard time.    I'm
              working on two at once.
<b>                            MICHAEL

              Oh yeah, who?

</b>              The brunette in the armchair in
              the living room -- her name's
              Rosalie...

          And the other one?
<b>                         JACK
</b>          Clementine -- she's waiting for
          me in the den.

He moves away towards the den.
<b>                         MICHAEL
</b>                 (to Sophia)
          Wait one second for me, I'll
          be right back.
Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie.
Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack,
he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman,
NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com-
pletely uninterested in the conversation.
<b>                        NICOLE
</b>          You guys have a beautiful place
          here. But the rent must be a
          killer.
Peter isn't paying attention.
<b>                        NICOLE
</b>          Isn't it a killer?
<b>                           PETER
</b>          What?...
<b>                           PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh,    the rent... yeah, it's high
          but    split between the three of
          us    it isn't that bad, as long
          as    we don't eat.
Nicole laughs.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Hi Peter, I'm looking for Jack,
          have you seen him?

</b>          Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing?
          Yeah, sure, I'll take you to
          Jack.
                 (to Nicole)
          Excuse me for a minute.
They move away.
<b>                        PETER

          trying to get away from that woman

         for 20 minutes. That sonofabitch
         Carl is moving in on my Natalie.
         Gotta go... bye.
<b>                       PAUL

<b>                       PETER
</b>                (in a hurry)
         He's around somewhere.     Check
         under all the couches.
Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter,

ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL.

<b>                       PETER
</b>         Oh Natalie, I've been looking
         for you all night.
<b>                       CARL
</b>         All night? I just saw you deep
         in conversation with Nicole!
<b>                       PETER
</b>         Deep? Hell no, we were just
         talking shop.
<b>                       NATALIE
</b>         Oh come on Peter, we all know
         what a ladies' man you are.
<b>                      PETER
</b>         Who, me? Jack's the ladies' man,
         not me. You're the only lady I'm
         after.
<b>                       CARL
</b>                (interrupting)
         So tell me, how's your project
         coming along? I heard you're not
         ready yet.
<b>                       PETER
</b>         We've still got two weeks left
         before the semi-finals. We'll
         be ready.
<b>                       CARL
</b>         We've been ready for three days
         now. We're gonna kick your ass.
<b>                       NATALIE
</b>         Their project is really incredible.

                  at Carl)
          No, it's top secret but he's been
          telling me about it...

Paul comes up to Jack, who is kneeling before Clementine,
whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. It
appears he's gotten beyond the "This is love at first
sight" stage. He's getting down to the nitty-gritty
now. Clementine is thrilled. Paul taps Jack on the
shoulder.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Jack, can I talk to you for a
          second?

</b>          Oh, hi, Paul, yeah sure...
<b>                        JACK (CONT'D)
</b>                 (to Clementine)
          ... Please darling, don't move...
          I'll be right back, okay? I'll
          bring us back some champagne...
He disappears with Paul.
<b>                        JACK
</b>          You're a lifesaver, Paul. I
          thought I'd never get away.
          Rosalie's waiting for me in the
          living room. Isn't she
          terrific?
<b>                            PAUL
</b>          Who?   Rosalie?
<b>                            JACK
</b>          Clementine.
<b>                        PAUL
</b>          Oh yeah, for sure, I dunno.
          Listen, can you do me a favor?
With some difficulty, Paul follows Jack as he picks his
way through the people dancing, heading in Rosalie's
direction.
<b>
</b><b>                                     12.

Damn, I've got to get her
a glass of champagne.
<b>              PAUL
</b>Listen, I've got a little problem.
I'm having a valuable package
delivered to me on Sunday, but I'm
not going to be home. I've got to
do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia
route, so can I have the package
delivered here instead?
<b>              JACK
</b>       (filling a glass
        with champagne)
Yeah, sure, of course.
       (he stops,
        thinking)
No, wait, I'm leaving for South
America tomorrow. I'll be gone
for three weeks.
<b>              JACK (CONT'D)
</b>But it's okay. Peter and Michael
will be here. They'll take care
of it.
<b>              PAUL
</b>Will you be sure to tell them
about it?
<b>               JACK
</b>Absolutely.   Don't worry about
a thing.
<b>              PAUL
</b>It'll be delivered Sunday and
picked up next Thursday, okay?
<b>              JACK
</b>Delivered Sunday picked up
Thursday. Got it. No problem.
<b>              PAUL
</b>This is a very delicate matter,
Jack. It's very important they
don't tell anybody about this
package. It could be very... uh,
embarrassing for me, you know
what I'm saying?
<b>             JACK
</b>Sure. You got it.    I'll see you
later...

    Jack is about to rejoin Rosalie.     Paul grabs his arm.
<b>                            PAUL
</b>              Not to anyone at all.    Tell
              them that, okay?

<b>                            JACK
</b>              Okay, sure, not to anyone at
              all... Look, I'm sorry Paul, but
              I gotta get back to Rosalie. Now
              go have a good time. I'll take
              care of everything.
<b>                            PAUL
</b>              Bye and thanks a lot.

<b>                            JACK
</b>              Don't mention it.
    Paul leaves.
    Jack finally reaches the armchair where Rosalie is
    sitting. He stops short, obviously disappointed.
<b>                             JACK
</b>              Uh-oh.   Too late.
    Michael is sitting next to Rosalie, right next to her.
    They get up to dance. As he passes Jack, Michael
    smiles broadly.
<b>                            MICHAEL
</b>              All's fair, old buddy...
    Jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile.
<b>                            JACK
</b>                     (singing)
              Oh my darling, oh my darling,
              oh my darling Clementine.
    Jack whirls around and heads back towards Clementine.

She has already left.   The door closes on the last of the
departing guests.

</b>          So you struck out again with

          we may be behind schedule, but
          we're still going to beat that
          sonofabitch and maybe I haven't
          scored with Natalie yet, but
          neither has he. She's not an easy

          You know what they say: it ain't
          over till it's over.
Peter and Michael go into the living room. Peter is
picking up glasses. Michael is emptying ashtrays into
the wastebasket.

              all the right buttons to push to
              make me mad.

    has his arm around Clementine's waist as he heads toward

          and then with Clementine. And

silently, "Maxine?"

              with someone else.

    Jack is in the cockpit with his copilot, RON. The
    ENGINES are REVVING. Jack is checking gauges. He looks
    out the window idly and sees:
    The crew of another plane walking across the tarmac.
    Paul is one of the crew. Paul sees Jack and begins to
    gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise
    of the ENGINES.
    Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his
    package.

</b>              The model's not finished, the
              blueprints are a mess and you may
              as well forget the specs, they're
              a disaster! I know we're talented.
              I know we're good. Then why is it
              we can never get organized? Why
              is it we're always behind schedule?
<b>                            JAY
</b>              Look, Jerry, architects since
              Leonardo have always been behind
              schedule. It's a tradition, for

         God's sake.   Why break with
         tradition?
<b>                       JERRY
</b>         Because this is the chance of a
         lifetime for our company, and
         there happens to be a deadline.
         There are millions of dollars
         at stake here. And our main
         competition had their project in
         three days ago!
<b>                       PETER
</b>         Yeah, but word around town is
         their project's a piece of
         shit!

<b>                       JERRY
</b>         Of course, it's a piece of shit,
         but it's a ready piece of shit.
<b>                       JAY
</b>         We're just going to have to buckle
         down, that's all.
<b>                       JERRY
</b>         You're damn right we are. Starting
         now, everybody works around the
         clock! Everybody! We have two
         weeks to be ready for the semi-
         final selection. And we will be
         ready. And we will win. You want
         to know why we'll win?
<b>                       JAY
</b>         Because we're gonna cheat.

</b>         I don't think this is a joking
         matter, gentlemen.

</b>         Come on, Jerry...
A SECRETARY enters.

     Peter picks up the phone.

<b>                            PETER
</b>              Hi... yeah... listen, make it
              quick, I'm in a meeting here...
              yeah, a package... okay...
              someone'll drop it off Sunday
              and pick it up Thursday...
              No problem ... yeah... we'll
              put it aside, okay... no, no,
              we won't tell anybody about it...

              kisses to the Brazilian girls,

     Peter hangs up, laughing.    Jerry gives him a dirty look.

</b>     Peter, dressed in casual clothes, knocks on the door of
     Michael's room, and peeks in.
     Michael is asleep fully clothed on his bed. His drawing
     table is strewn with papers, overflowing ashtrays and
     empty coffee cups. The lamp is still on.
<b>                            PETER

</b>     Peter opens the front door, he stumbles over an object,
     looks down; at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined
     with pretty pink-and-white checked gingham. In the
     basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently
     resting on a lace pillow. Peter looks at this object
     in amazement. There is an envelope pinned to the basket
     with the words, "FOR JACK" written on it. Peter picks up
     the letter -- he opens it and reads.

</b>                      (to himself)

     Abruptly he turns and races back to Michael's room.

                      (mutters)
               This has gotta be somebody's idea
               of a joke!
     They run to the front door.

<b>                             PETER

         letter)
'Dearest Jack, here is the fruit

her. I have to go to Europe and
Japan for six months, her name is

</b>Give it back to her mother, that's
what.
<b>              MICHAEL
</b>But it says she went to Europe.
<b>              PETER
</b>Well, we'll see about that, d'you

<b>              MICHAEL
</b>Whose phone number?

of this chick!
<b>              PETER

is?
<b>              MICHAEL
</b>No way. If I had to keep track
of all Jack's girlfriends, I'd
have to be a full-time secretary.
<b>              PETER
</b>Well, what are we gonna do?
<b>              MICHAEL
</b>Hey, look, she's waking up...
Hey, look, she's crying...

</b>What's her problem?
<b>              MICHAEL
</b>Maybe she's hungry?
<b>              PETER
</b>Well, what are we s'posed to do?
<b>              MICHAEL
</b>Feed her, I guess...
<b>              PETER
</b>Yeah, but what?

<b>              MICHAEL
</b>Soft stuff... I guess.
<b>              PETER
</b>       (exploding)
Oh no, I swear to God this is
unreal! Can you believe that
bastard Jack?! 'A little package,'
he tells me on the phone, 'just
put it aside till Thursday.' Put
it aside -- can you believe him!?
<b>               MICHAEL
</b>Really?   Jack said that?

</b>Oh, so he told you about this?

making! What are we s'posed to
do?

</b>         She lives in Miami for Christsake.
         She can't stop the baby crying
         from Miami.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         Well, just to ask her advice...

</b>         No! No way! You know what a pain
         that woman is -- she'll be on the
         next plane here to move in with
         us...
<b>                       MICHAEL

         handle that, besides you know
         the rule around here: it's fine
         to have a woman over once in a
         while, but...
Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him.

Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the
elevator.

               never held a baby -- I'll drop

     Peter is already gone.

<b>     CLERK.

<b>                             CLERK
</b>               Down there by the meat section.
     Peter heads for it purposefully. When he    gets to the
     right aisle, he stops short, taken aback:    a vast range
     of products extends before him. He starts    examining the
     baby food jars and cans of formulas, going   from one to
     the next, not knowing where to begin.

</b>     Michael is still in the hall holding Mary very clumsily
     in his arms. He is anxious. He realizes she's soaked.
     This disgusts him. He holds her at arm's length; she
     squirms. He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom,
     spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the
     baby down on it. MARY SCREAMS -- she much prefers
     Michael's arms to the couch. A panicky Michael picks her
     up again, grumbling.
<b>                             MICHAEL
</b>               Okay, okay, don't cry like that...
               I'll hold you, I'll hold you.
     He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around
     the child. Obviously Michael is very put off by the
     smell coming from Mary.

<b>              STORE CLERK
</b>They're all good, sir.
<b>              PETER
</b>       (pointing to another

Oh, okay, then I can take this

</b>Oh.   Is that good or bad?

</b>It's very good.

</b>Well, why don't they all have
iron in them?
<b>              STORE CLERK
</b>Some babies are allergic to iron.

</b>     Now Peter is surrounded by three women arguing: The
     Store Clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily
     looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort
     of young woman (WOMAN #1); and another thin, pale woman
     whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping
     cart and who seems very nervous (WOMAN #2).
<b>                             WOMAN #1
</b>               Does she have any teeth yet or
               not? That would give us a clue
               as to how old she is.
<b>                             PETER
</b>               I haven't looked.

</b>                      (coolly disagree-
                       ing; to Woman #1)
               My grandson's only five months old
               and he already has two teeth.
               But my daughter didn't have a
               single one at seven months -- so,
               y'know, how many teeth they have...
               doesn't mean a thing.
<b>                              WOMAN #2
</b>               But didn't those friends of yours
               tell you what formula they usually
               give the baby?
<b>                             PETER

               No, actually they had to leave
               unexpectedly. They had to catch
               a plane...
<b>                             WOMAN #1

               fists? Does she put everything
               into her mouth?
     She acts out her words.
<b>                             PETER

<b>              PETER
</b>       (as Woman #2 is
        starting to get on
        his nerves)
I told you they had to leave
unexpectedly.
<b>              WOMAN #1
</b>Or else you could weigh her; that
would tell you how old she is.
<b>              STORE CLERK
</b>See, my five-month-old grandson
weighs more than my neighbor's
grandson and he's nine months old.
So, y'know, how much they weigh...
doesn't mean a thing.
<b>              PETER
</b>So what about me? What should I
buy?
<b>              WOMAN #2
</b>Didn't they even tell you the
pediatrician's name?
<b>               PETER
</b>        (still calm)
No.   They didn't.
<b>              WOMAN #2
</b>You sure have weird friends.
<b>              PETER
</b>You have no idea how weird.
<b>              WOMAN #1
</b>Or else her hair. Does she have
lots of hair?
<b>              STORE CLERK
</b>My grandson, y'know, he has so
much hair you can make a ponytail
with it! And I know some kids
who are totally bald at a year-
and-a-half. So, y'know, how much
hair they have... doesn't mean a
thing...

Gee, he's really something, your
grandson -- is he good at math
too?

</b>               Look, ladies, thanks for all the

               take one of each. To be on the

<b>                             STOCK CLERK

               Don't forget -- if the baby's
               less than three months old, you
               have to be sure to sterilize the
               bottles.

     Peter stops and turns back.

</b>     Michael is rapidly    pacing up and down the apartment,
     vigorously rocking    Mary. As soon as he sits down
     anywhere to rest,    MARY SCREAMS, so Michael pops back
     up and begins the    marathon all over again.

          be back soon.
Michael starts to close the door.    She pushes it back
open and holds out the package.
<b>                        MANAGER
</b>          Oh here, this just came for you.
          They just dropped it off. Can
          I hold her for a second?

</b>          Well, like, y'see... she doesn't
          like to be held by strangers...
The apartment Manager has already given Michael the
package and grabbed Mary. She covers her with kisses.
Mary smiles. Michael absent-mindedly looks at the
package.

     Mrs. Razzolini regretfully hands the baby back. No
     sooner is MARY back in Michael's arms than she SCREAMS
     her head off.
     He closes the door; his smile instantly fades.

</b>     Peter and Michael have laid Mary down on the couch,
     taking care to place several towels between her bottom
     and the immaculate velvet. Mary is squirming, laughing,
     feeling great. They have already gone through half
     a box of cotton in their attempts to clean up the
     crap. But it's still all over, on their hands, on the
     baby's feet and legs, on the towels, etc.

     in the crap.

<b>                             MICHAEL

               if you don't want me to let

Michael hands him a diaper.        Peter tries to figure out
how it goes on.
<b>                        PETER
</b>          These tape things -- do they

Peter tries to slide the diaper under Mary's backside
but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet.
<b>                        PETER
</b>          Hold her under her arms -- I'm
          gonna try it this way.
Michael holds Mary under    her armpits.     Peter tries to put
the diaper on her. It's     hard. What's     more, it would
seem that Michael didn't    buy the right    size -- The
diaper comes all the way    up to Mary's    chin.
<b>                        PETER
</b>          What the hell kind of lousy
          stinking diapers did you get?
          They're way too big!
<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          I don't think they're too big --
          They're ultra-absorbent. That's
          all. The more absorbent the
          better.
Peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper.
<b>                        PETER

          things work? Hold her for

<b>                           PETER
</b>          There.     I got it.
He tapes the diaper closed.
<b>                           PETER
</b>          Damn it.     I didn't make it tight
          enough.

     He tapes the other side:   the diaper gapes and sags.
<b>                             MICHAEL
</b>               It's not working... What about
               laying her down?

</b>               Go ahead... No, not on the towels,
               they're all covered with crap...
     Michael lays Mary down right on the couch. Peter vigor-
     ously undoes the tape, and the whole PLASTIC lining RIPS
     apart.

     Peter takes the torn diaper off. MARY utters a TINY CRY
     and pees copiously all over the velvet couch.

     Mary gives them a big smile.

     puts down in the living room, now transformed into a
     nursery. A makeshift changing table, rubber wash basin,
     baby clothes, baby lotion, talcum powder, soap and baby
     shampoo, etc. are all over the place. He drops all his

     They are being followed by the beige Chevy that pulls
     ahead of them and parks just beyond them. In this car
     we recognize Graton sitting with a partner.
     The two men, who look like young tough guys (punks), get
     off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the
     building.
     Graton gets out of his car    and heads for the building.
     He glances into the lobby,    then goes in. He watches the
     elevator floor indicator,    notes the floor it stops on,
     then calmly returns to his    car.

     couches. The DOORBELL RINGS. Michael springs up and
     runs to open the door. Peter follows him.
     On the    doorstep stand the TWO PUNKS. One of them is
     short    and speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent. The
     other,    tall, thin and creepy-looking, stands behind his

Peter is sitting    on something hard. He pulls it out from

reading: "Care     of Jack Collins." He tosses it to the

the package and    runs into Michael's room.

               catch up with them...
     Michael runs to the window.
     Peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the
     front door. He presses the button for the elevator.
     It's in use.
<b>                              PETER
</b>               Goddamit!
     He opens the door leading to the stairs and races down
     them, holding on to the bannister. He flies, overwhelmed
     by anxiety. Suddenly he trips, loses his balance and
     makes a spectacular crash landing. The package gets a
     bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder
     spill out of it. Peter stares at them in horror.
<b>                             PETER
</b>               What the hell is this?
     He picks up a few packets and examines them.
<b>                             PETER
</b>               Oh, God, no... dope!    That's all
               we need!
     He starts to tremble  with fear. He picks the packets up
     as fast as he can and  hastily puts them back into what's
     left of the package;  then shoves it all into his pocket
     and continues racing  down the stairs.

Peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. A
patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car
in which Graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the
action.

As he speaks, Peter undoes the bungie cord from around
the basket and takes it off the motorcycle.
<b>                        PETER
</b>          No, really, Officer, they weren't

Punk #1 gives him a dirty look.

The punks exchange a glance.   Suddenly Punk #1 shouts:
<b>                        PUNK #1
</b>          Go!
They take off running in different directions. Cop #1
charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's
still in the car:
<b>                        COP #1
</b>          Watch the guy with the basket!
Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand.

They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying
the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched
on the horrible package hidden in his pocket.
Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed.
Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show-
ing him his badge.

     Peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through
     the house, carrying the basket.
     As soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running
     like a madman down the corridor. He runs into Michael
     who was just coming to meet him.

Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to
climb out it when Peter stops him.

</b>     Michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with
     his back to us, he seems quite busy.
     As we CLOSE IN, we discover that he has opened the box of
     diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic
     has been carefully cut out with scissors.
     Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ-
     ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves
     them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket.
     Then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and
     flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be-
     tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric.
     Next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put
     back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones.
     Michael closes the box again and glues it together so
     it looks as if it's never been opened. He throws all
     the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of
     his brand-new box of diapers. He walks away.

     Michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes Mary from
     Peter and disappears with the box of diapers.
     In his room, he lays Mary down on his bed and starts

</b>     Mary is lying on Michael's bed. He has just finished
     putting a regular diaper on her.
     Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the
     box. He finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and
     places it under Mary's bottom.
     Just then Agent #3 appears in the doorway. Michael
     calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the
     baby on top of the other one. MARY is COOING. Every-
     thing appears normal. However, a trained eye might be
     very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper
     covering the young lady's backside. But a narcotics
     agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to
     notice something odd like this.
     Agent #3 silently observes Michael, who gives him a big
     smile as he slips on Mary's pajama bottoms. Michael
     picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the
     kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.

He goes back to the living room, followed by Agent #3.

Agent #1 is in the process of showing Peter a photograph.
<b>                        AGENT #1
</b>          Do you recognize anyone in this

Peter looks: it's the photo of Jack and Paul that was
taken at the beginning of the movie.

</b>                  (pointing)

<b>                         AGENT #1
</b>          Oh yeah?   Now that's interesting.
Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket,
observed by the five cops. He now sits down, cheerful
and bubbling over with enthusiasm.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>          So! Can I get you something to
          drink?
Agent #1 totally ignores him.

          my vacation to take care of her,

          meantime, I'd appreciate it if you
          didn't leave New York in the next
          few days.
All the cops head for the door. Michael accompanies
them, putting on a very urbane act.

<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          Come back anytime, gentlemen.

Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living
room. Peter has collapsed into his armchair.

</b>     The three men, slumped in their car, are watching the
     door of the apartment building.

     The three narcotics Agents emerge from the building and
     walk away. A short time goes by. Peter and Michael
     emerge from the building and quickly walk away. The three
     men get out of their car, cross the street and enter the
     building.

     Peter comes out of the elevator, key in hand. He's about
     to put it in the lock on the door, but stops short -- the
     door is already open.
<b>                              PETER
</b>               Michael?   Michael, are you here?
     No answer.
     Peter pushes the door open. The sight that greets his
     eyes is very dismaying. It looks like a tornado has hit
     the house. Everything's on the floor, it's all been
     smashed, it's all been ripped apart. Gone is the beauti-
     ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated. In
     its place, utter devastation and shambles.
     Peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful
     thought crosses his mind. He runs like crazy into his
     room -- the basket's not there. Stepping over the debris
     and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into
     the living room, then into Michael's room. The basket's
     nowhere to be seen.
     Peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan-
     ing and muttering distractedly. He runs into Jack's
     room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom. The basket is
     nowhere to be seen. Peter runs all over, back and forth
     ten times in all the rooms. Tears are flowing from his
     eyes.
     Suddenly, he hears FAINT CRIES.   They're coming from the
     back bathroom. Peter rushes to   it, practically ripping
     the door from its hinges. There   on the toilet is the
     basket, and on it there's a note  written in big messy
     printing which says: "NEXT TIME   WE TAKE HER."
     Mary looks at Peter and smiles; she seems in great shape.
     A distraught Peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and
     kisses her all over as he takes her into his room.
     Just then, Michael appears in the corridor, silent and

     overwhelmed. He comes to the door to Peter's    room and
     looks at him. Peter, mortified to have been    caught
     kissing Mary, hastily distances himself from   her, hold-
     ing her at arm's length. He puts her down on    his bed
     and exits the room.

</b>     The debris has been shoved up against the walls. Peter
     and Michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped
     over the table. Peter is giving Mary her bottle.
     Michael is looking at Mary as though he were seeing her
     for the first time.

</b>     Peter is in bed, completely out of it.
     Michael is changing Mary very carefully. He puts one
     diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. He
     lays Mary down in her basket, then places the basket on
     the bed, nestled between the wall and Peter's body.
     Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out.
     Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket. Mary and
     he stare at each other intently and seriously. Peter
     switches off the light.

     Michael, asleep on his mattress on the    floor in the
     middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges    from sleep and
     glances at his clock: it's 6:10 AM.      He staggers to the
     front door and opens it. The door is     being held together
     with a string.
     Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other
     cops backing them up.
     Mrs. Razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide-
     eyed, a look of horror on her face.

     Peter gets up, takes the basket off the bed and keeps it
     in his hands. The Agent searches the bed.

     above. Peter comes out of the building and turns left,
     walking very quickly.
     Suddenly, Peter stops, turns     around and retraces his
     steps. We can clearly see a      man, who was walking about
     six yards behind Peter on the     opposite side of the
     street, also turn around and     retrace his steps.
     It is Graton.

                       three times)

     He runs off, disappearing into the darkness. From the
     slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk.
     Michael is shaking all over. Standing about twenty yards
     away, Graton hasn't missed a thing.

Michael takes the basket handle from  Peter's hand, places
the basket carefully on the bed, and  walks without a word
towards Jack, who he takes by the arm  and steers into the
living room. Peter softly shuts the   door behind them and
follows.

     MARY, wearing a bonnet and coat, is lying on one of the

     coat, Michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package
     which he puts in a plastic bag, along with a book, a
     baby rattle, and a clean diaper.
     Peter and Jack, disguised as punks, each with punk
     hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses, are climbing
     out the window leading to the fire escape.

     Mary on her blanket near him.
     Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass,
     watching them out of the corner of his eye.
     Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby.
     The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around
     a girl. He strolls by casually. He spots Michael and
     their eyes meet. The couple sit down on a bench a few
     yards away and they begin "making out."

Michael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti-
tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside
him. He puts the clean diaper on her.
Graton, nervous and wary,   watches Michael and the
passersby. Just then, two    punks (Peter and Jack) come
running up to Michael. He    ostensibly takes the brown
package out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them.
The two punks immediately take off with the package.
Graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off
after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes
detectives, who'd been hiding all around.
Michael quickly gets up,    picks Mary up and discreetly
deposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving
the punk on the bench an    intent look. Then he goes off
in the direction of the    cops.
The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the
diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and
goes off in the opposite direction.
The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put
up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them.

          Officer, will you please open this
          package in front of these witnesses?
The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate
Easter bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all
the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate
inside them.
<b>                        MICHAEL

     Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain.
     He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where
     Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the
     trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the
     garbage around like a lunatic.

</b>     In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as
     a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around
     in circles with each other and laughing. They are
     singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har-
     monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael,
     holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to
     him and starts turning around in circles with him.
     MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is
     LAUGHING her head off.
     In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk
     getup, is on the phone. He's got a glass in his hand
     and is a little smashed.

</b>     A broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul
     is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up
     and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand.
     Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and  sends him
     with a forceful shove flying into the water.   Paul lands
     on his back with a big splash, and comes back  up to the
     surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over   the water
     and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit  drunk.

     He's got a bottle ready in his hand.

     They go into the kitchen together. Peter immediately
     gets busy; he heats the bottle up quickly while Jack
     soothes the hungry Mary by carrying her in his arms.

     Jack goes to the door.
     At the door stands a rather distinguished-looking woman,
     with her hair tied back very properly, a suitcase in her
     hand. It is MRS. BRETSAWS, who speaks with a British
     accent.

     They disappear into the living room. Jack shuts the door
     behind him. Michael peeks into the hall, then goes and
     looks into the living room through the crack in the door.

<b>              PETER

'cause there's no way we're gonna
take care of her all by ourselves
anymore!

changes, her bath and her laundry.

                give a shit. I don't need you

                to do it. And I won't take the

      his friend Paul, who   jumps three feet away to avoid a
      potential mishap with   Jack.

      He's got a sleeping Mary in his arms. The basket is on
      the floor beside the bed. Jack attempts to put Mary back
      in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits
      back down again and doesn't move. Mary falls back asleep.
      Jack looks at her skin, her hands. Very gently, he
      kisses her forehead. Mary smiles in her sleep.

</b>       It's noon, the sun is   shining brightly. Michael is
       diapering Mary on her   changing table. She's naked.
       He tickles her, bites   her toes, neck and ears; she
       bursts out laughing.    Michael is totally gaga over her.

      Peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward
      his room. He stops short in the corridor -- he hears
      Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's.
      Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and
      listens, troubled. Then he walks away and shouts, as
      though he were just coming out of his room.

      Michael stops his baby-talk immediately, as though sud-
      denly paralyzed, embarrassed, guilty. Peter enters the
      room.

      naked and wrapped in a towel.

      Peter carefully locks the door behind him. He removes
      Mary's towel and sits her in her little tub, filled
      with warm water.
      Mary quivers as she comes in contact with the water.
      Peter kneels down and very gently pours glasses of water
      on her shoulders and head. The water streams down her
      face. She blinks and laughs. Peter whispers lovingly
      to her in a barely audible, very low voice. Mary
      stares at him.

</b>      Although it is dark, we can distinguish in Jack's bed
      a rather bulky shape, which is moving around under the
      comforter and doesn't exactly seem to be sleeping...
      Suddenly, from the direction of    the living room, we can
      hear MARY CRYING. Jack emerges     from under the comforter
      and switches on the light: he     has a female guest in
      his bed, a pretty BRUNETTE this    time.

      He gets up, slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the
      bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him. He
      goes into the living room, picks Mary up, and showers
      her with kisses.
      Mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on
      Jack's shoulder, sucking her thumb. Jack rocks her
      for a moment then puts her back to bed.
      Mary instantly starts crying again. Jack very quickly
      picks her up again and kisses her. Mary is delighted
      by his tenderness. Jack puts her back to bed again.

      Mary keeps crying, Jack picks her up again. Peter and

      sleep, enter the living room.

      Jack puts Mary back to bed. Michael, as a routine,
      sings a major chord, giving each of them their notes.
      They start singing a lullabye in three-part harmony,
      as they lean over the crib. Mary is in seventh heaven.
      She looks up at them, she stops crying, she sucks her
      thumb.

</b>      Peter, Michael and Jack have guests over for dinner.
      CLASSICAL MUSIC, a very fancy table, candles: they're
      at the tail-end of the dinner, before dessert. Everyone
      is very fashionably dressed.

      Natalie is sitting between Peter and Carl. Jay and
      Jerry, Peter's partners, are also there with their wives.
      Michael and Sophia are having a vehement discussion as
      usual, Jack is between two gorgeous models: CHRISTIE
      and CAROLINE.

</b>                No, I haven't had the time lately.

out. The guests haven't heard anything.

silence.

They both enter the living room. Mary stares at Sylvia.
When she spots Mary, Sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears.
Peter is dumbfounded.

playpen.

Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia. Without
looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop
crying.

      He exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into

He hands two bibs to Sylvia.
Sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front
of Michael's room, where she looks strangely at the
changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and
the baby's toilet articles.
Sylvia enters the living room.
Michael has spread all of Mary's clothes, neatly folded
and ironed on the couch. He is packing them in a big
bag.

Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on
the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the
living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed
animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white
tulle frames the crib.

She rubs noses with Mary.
Peter and Michael approach.

The three men are lined up on the sidewalk. Mary stares
at them, looking a little lost. They wave their hands
and:

MARY LAUGHS and waves.

      drunk. He kisses her and leads her into his room, clos-

      Michael enters a fancy building on 5th Avenue.   He's
      carrying a big portfolio and is full of beans.
      In the lobby, he pushes the button for the elevator and
      looks around absentmindedly.

      His gaze suddenly freezes on something.
      By the guard's desk he notices a stroller. Inside, look-
      ing pretty bored, is MARY. Michael is overwhelmed.
      He walks toward Mary and through the sea of people --
      they exchange an intense look.
      He looks around and suddenly sees Sylvia and two men
      deep in discussion coming out of an elevator. Michael,
      startled, runs and hides behind one of the elevators,
      staring out wide-eyed.
      Sylvia is dressed in a very chic, tight black suit, with
      a veiled little black hat and spiked heels. One of the
      men is carrying a bunch of cameras. They walk out
      toward the front door, and Sylvia suddenly stops. She
      seems to have forgotten something. She kisses them
      goodbye and heads toward the elevator. Once she's out
      of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave.
      When they're gone for sure, she rushes toward Mary and
      showers her with kisses.

</b>                Oh, she's been great!
      She wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly
      takes off her high heels, and her hat, and stuffs them
      into a big bag. She takes out a pair of old shoes and
      a comfortable jacket, and slips them on. She removes
      the pins from her hair -- she looks like her normal self
      again.
      She leaves, pushing the stroller out the door.
      Michael stands frozen.

      ment. He's with a few of his colleagues, both men and
      women. They say good night to each other.
      Everyone goes into his or her own room.

      Jack's the last one, he goes into his room alone. His
      smile drops. For a moment he stands there just looking.
      He sits down on the bed: on the pillow is a little
      chocolate Santa Claus with a card that reads "Merry
      Christmas. The Marriott Hotels." Jack contemplates
      it forlornly.

      Michael and Sophia, both in kimonos, are sitting in
      front of the last bits of an elegant midnight supper,
      in Michael's room. The bed in unmade.
      Sophia, a glass of champagne in her hand, is yakking
      away nonstop, like a real motor-mouth.
      Michael, silent, is doodling on a paper napkin.
      His pen is making little squares and circles; the circles
      come together and start looking like a baby lying in a
      crib.
      Sophia is absorbed in her monologue.
      Suddenly Michael realizes what he has drawn. He crumples
      the napkin and throws it in the wastebasket. Sophia
      hasn't noticed anything. Michael is bored stiff.

      giraffe.

      Peter stares at the giraffe, horrified. He feels the
      tears coming to his eyes. Grabbing the giraffe, he
      hurls it with all his might against the wall.

Jack, alone in his room, with his back to us, is facing
his full-length mirror.
He's looking at himself, with one fist on his hip and
the other hand clutching a half-empty bottle of scotch.
He observes himself and slowly turns around -- we can
now see him in profile. His hair is disheveled, he's
unshaven, and he's put a pillow underneath his sweater.
He's pregnant. He takes a big swig of scotch. The
DOORBELL RINGS. Jack walks away from the mirror. He
staggers dead drunk. But dignified, pregnant.
Jack opens the door. Standing there is Graton holding
a stuffed animal, a rabbit.

He follows the Young Man in Sylvia's studio. It's very
messy. On the table there's a big heap of books and
papers. Mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper
and a sweater, but her legs are bare. She's playing
with an empty pack of cigarettes. She looks at Jack
with a serious, unruffled expression.

Silence. The Young Man sits down at the table and
immerses himself in his books.
Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore.

</b>         Listen, on second thought, I
         don't think I'll wait for her.
         Just give her this when she gets
         back, okay? And this is for the
         baby.
Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man,
who plops them down on a chair.

</b>         Sure, no problem.
He immerses himself again in his books.
Jack heads toward the door, then turns around.

</b>          Yeah, of course, 'cause after
          the 5:30 bottle it starts all
          over again around nine...
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          And by the time I change her
          and play with her a little, it's
          already eight o'clock...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          And then that's it -- you get
          only an hour of sleep.
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          And the babysitters till three
          A.M. -- all my money is sucked

</b>
          down the tubes!
<b>                        JACK
</b>          Plus they don't put the kids to
          bed, they let them lie around
          half-naked...

<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          Oh, so the flowers and the
          rabbit were from you...
<b>                        JACK
</b>          I could have strangled that guy...
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          I mean it, I can't cope anymore.
          My parents and I don't talk to
          each other and anyway they live
          in Texas, and the baby needs to
          get out to the park...
<b>                        MICHAEL
</b>          Yeah, tell me about it! Finding
          time to take her to the park
          every day is a real bitch!
<b>                         SYLVIA
</b>          And I have to work, I need the
          money to survive and anyway I
          love my job...
A distraught Peter, bare-chested and in jeans, comes
running in from his room.
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>          But to work I've gotta have
          a babysitter, and to have a
          babysitter I need to work,
          so I run around all day...
                 (she sobs)
          ... and I'm not sure I'm
          taking good care of her...
<b>                        PETER
</b>          Of course you're taking good
          care of her -- we know what it's
          like, don't cry, she looks great...
<b>                        SYLVIA
</b>                 (sobbing)
          It's just 'cause I haven't slept
          in four nights -- she must be
          teething or something, I don't
          know but I can't manage...
<b>                        PETER
</b>          Don't worry, it's nothing, she's
<b>
</b><b>                                                              138.
</b>
         cutting a tooth -- you just have
         to put some stuff on her gums...
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         She pulled the same thing on us.
         We lost all our friends in one
         night -- on account of one tooth!
<b>                          SYLVIA
</b>         And just look    at my face!
         Nobody's going    to want me to
         model for them    with the way my
         face looks...    And what'll happen
         to me if they    don't want me
         anymore?

<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         But you're beautiful -- At your
         age all you need is a good night's
         sleep and you'll look like new.
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>         Right, a good night's sleep --
         but when?
<b>                       PETER
</b>         Well, why don't you leave the
         baby with us for a few days,
         till you recuperate... I mean,
         if you want.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         We're old pros -- it's not a
         big deal for us...
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>                (blowing her nose,
                 wiping her eyes)
         Really? I can leave her with
         you for a little while?
<b>                        JACK
</b>         Of course. Leave her with us.
         Come back whenever you want.
         Get some rest.
Sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her
on the doorstep.
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>         I brought a couple of things
         for her, just for a few days...
Michael eagerly takes the bag from her.    It's followed by
a second, and then a third.
<b>                          PETER
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                           139.
</b>
                (taking Mary
                 in his arms)
         Is she hungry?
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>         Yeah, it's time for her bottle
         -- it's all ready in the bag...
<b>                       JACK
</b>         I'll go heat up some water right
         away. Would you like a cup of
         coffee?
<b>                       SYLVIA
</b>         Oh, okay, thanks...

Peter, carrying Mary towards the kitchen, is followed by
Jack and Michael with the bags.
Sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the
hall.
In the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags,
the bottle, the saucepan... They've swallowed all their
pride and are kissing Mary all over, on her neck, her
hands, her tummy. They're deliriously happy. Michael
takes some sheets out of the bag.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         I'll go make up her bed!
He exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around,
leaping and dancing... He gets to the living room and
goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes,
a fearful expression on his face. Then he turns and
races back to the kitchen.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>                (floored)
         Hey, you guys -- come and see,
         come and see!
<b>                        PETER
</b>         What?
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         Come see, I said.
Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living
room. They stop short in front of the crib: There is
Sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb
and sleeping like an angel.
<b>                       MICHAEL
</b>         The poor thing, she's really
         wiped out.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               140.
</b>
<b>                          JACK
</b>            She'll need two or three months
            to recover, at least... Maybe
            more!
<b>                          PETER
</b>            We could set up a room for her
            here...
<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>            A room for her and a room for
            Mary...
<b>                          JACK
</b>            Then we could have four shifts
            instead of three!

<b>                          PETER
</b>            Yeah, but I don't think she'll
            agree. She's got her own life
            to live.
<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>            Yeah, she probably wouldn't want
            to move here. She'd think we'd
            jump on her any chance we could...
<b>                          JACK
</b>            But we'd make a rule, she'd just
            be 'one of the guys!'
<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>            She'll never want to...
<b>                          SYLVIA
</b>                   (very awake)
            So, I'll take the ten A.M. to three
            P.M. shift... And I'll take every
            other night... plus the walk in
            the park in the afternoon before I
            go to work... and we split the
            rent equally... and I'll just be
            'one of the guys'... deal?
<b>                           PETER, MICHAEL, AND JACK
</b>                    (smiling broadly)
            Deal.
Mary    suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead-
ily    but determinedly. She's dragging Graton's rabbit by
its    ear. She looks at the four of them and laughs her
head    off.
<b>FREEZE FRAME.

<b>                              END!
