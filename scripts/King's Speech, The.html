    A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free
    standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs -
    bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's "Trumpet
    Volunteer".

    A head emerges.

    White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing
    naked wet body in white towels.

    The ritual continues with crisp military precision.

    CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and
    unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp,
    thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and
    Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown.

    This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white
    shirt.

    Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet
    and gartered legs to be inserted.

    Mirror-polished boots are laced tight.

    Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received.

    Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling
    field of ribbons and medallions.

    Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted.

    Polished buttons are fastened.

    Multi-coloured collar clasped shut.

    White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed
    and placed upon brilliantined hair.

    PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known
    to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second
    son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a
    sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which
    he's been bedecked.

    Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself:
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    3.


<b>                             BERTIE
</b>                   You look like a Christmas tree.

    He smiles wanly.

    THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill.

    Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess.

    Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH -
    considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land,
    truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from
    all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously,
    creating a happy chaos.

    Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave.

    Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and
    four, wave back from their nursery window.

<b>                             ELIZABETH
</b>                   Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't
                   rain.

    BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators,
    prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs,
    agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry
    placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of
    the day.

    A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose
    spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants.

    REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back.

    The first drops splatter against the glass.      Elizabeth sighs.

    Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour,
    which segues into a GARGLING sound.

    A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling
    while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the
    ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He
    expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth
    fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an
    atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb,
    and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the
    control room.

    The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three...

    ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas
    hiding the spectators from view.

    Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded
    chairs with the other dignitaries. They are:

    KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and
    uniform, accompanied by his wife.

    QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame.

    DR COSMO LANG - a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed,
    balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority.

    WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is
    lean. They are bantering rivals in ambition.

    STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day. Heavy-browed.
    His hair, as always, parted down the middle.

    NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer. Tall, thin,
    lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk.

    A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on
    springs next to the stadium equipment. It looks frightening,
    even to us. Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a
    blow. Elizabeth sees his terror.

<b>                             ELIZABETH

                       (as though Bertie didn't
                        exist)
                   His brother, and father, have been
                   broadcasting since last year.

    The King, growing impatient, hisses:

<b>                             KING GEORGE V
</b>                   Get on with it. Show what you're made of!

    Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of
    confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots,
    chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.

<b>                             BERTIE
</b>                   Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.

    It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter.
    A man who cannot speak in public.

    Lang whispers to Churchill.    When Lang whispers, everyone can
    hear.

<b>                             COSMO LANG
</b>                   I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage
                   for all the world. And on such an important
                   occasion.

    Lang really is a piece of work.

    For ease of reading, Bertie's stutter is not indicated from this
    point on in the script.

<b>                             BERTIE
</b>                   No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was

    POV - a sea of dripping umbrellas. No response. This is going
    to be a torment for him, and his audience.

     decorated with white silk roses, now limp. A veil covers her
     features.

     She waits. Coughs.    No response.    Calls imperiously:

</b>                    In the lav.

     Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She's
     further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed,
     and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE. He's in his
     forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. His
     demeanor is friendly, but professional. The accent, although
     Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist.

she's gloved.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Of course my husband wants to be cured! His

Called upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly. But the

            went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park.
            They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The
            white horse said "neigh". The black horse
            said, "neigh". The white horse continued
            on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park.
            The black horse continued on, clip clop
            clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the
            end of the story. Now off to bed.

     Elizabeth and Bertie in the back.

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  Is this necessary?

<b>                            ELIZABETH
</b>                  You know perfectly well.

     As they pass a corner news stand, the headline chalkboard reads:
<b>     PRINCE OF WALES TELLS MINERS "SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!"
</b>
<b>                            ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>                  Neglects to tell them what must be done,
                  how its to be done, and who's to do it.

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  David has `the touch'. They adore him.

     As the Austin halts for lights, people stare to see who's
     inside. Some point.

<b>                            BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>                  I'll wager they're saying: There's the
                  useless one who can't speak.

</b>
     Bertie and Elizabeth enter. She explains in a whisper:
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   19.


<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            There's no receptionist.

Elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door.

<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>                (loudly)
            The Johnsons.

From the inner office.

<b>                      LIONEL (O.S.)
</b>            Not finished yet.

Elizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            How'd you find this physician?

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>                (poker-faced)
            Classifieds; next to "Saucy model,
            Shepherd's Market".

Bertie smiles despite his mood.

<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>            Comes highly recommended. Charges
            substantial fees in order to help the poor.
                (realizes)
            Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I'm not sure I want to see this fellow.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            I'm not sure he wants to see you.

The consultation room door opens and a working class young woman
- ANNA - comes out; then realizes with a gasp who they are. She
retreats rapidly back into the consulting room.

<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>            Perhaps this was a mistake.

After an uncomfortable moment, Anna returns, attempting to be
properly formal, and stutters:

<b>                      ANNA
</b>            You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I'm not actually Mr ...
        TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   20.


<b>                           ANNA
</b>                     (whispers, terrified)
                 I know.
                     (then to Elizabeth)
                 Dr Logue says...

<b>                            LIONEL (O.S.)
</b>                 Lionel!

<b>                           ANNA
</b>                 Lionel says...wait here if you wish. Or, it
                 being a pleasant day, take a stroll.
                     (to the consultation room)
                 Was that alright?

<b>                           LIONEL (O.S.)
</b>                 Bloody marvellous.

<b>                           ANNA
</b>                     (choking up)
                 Thank you...Lionel.

     Anna flees quickly.

<b>                           LIONEL (O.S.)
</b>                 Mr. Johnson, do come in.

     The Yorks look at each other.


<b>24   INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY                        24
</b>
     A totally different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A
     world of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two
     slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish
     rug. Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Model airplanes hanging
     from the ceiling. Recording apparatus. The walls are pearl grey
     and smoky blue.

<b>                           BERTIE
</b>                 My wife's favorite colours.

     Here, in a doctor's office, Bertie's stutter returns.

<b>                           LIONEL
</b>                 Glad we have something in common.

     Bertie's head bangs into one of the models.

<b>                           LIONEL (CONT'D)

<b>                         BERTIE
</b>             Please...

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>             What?

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             You're too close. Five paces is the rule of
             thumb.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>             That might be difficult in this office.

Bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair.

<b>                       LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>             Nice girl, Anna. Worried she wouldn't find
             a husband if she couldn't speak. Tried to
             convince her men will find her even more
             attractive as a silent partner. The perfect
             woman. Sorry, bad Australian joke. Why'd
             your wife change her mind and ask for an
             appointment?

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             I can't discuss that.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>             What can we talk about?

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             That's better. When speaking with a Royal
             one waits for the Royal to start the
             conversation and chose the topic.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>             Your joking. That won't work here.

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             I admit if one waits for me to start a
             conversation one can wait a rather long
             time.

Silence.   They stare at each other.

<b>                       BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>             You call this making me comfortable?

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>             You call this being forthcoming?

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             Aren't you interested in treating me?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   22.


<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Only if you're interested in being cured.

More silence.

<b>                          LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            Cuppa tea?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            No thank you.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I need one.

Turns on the hot plate.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            Any idea what you're letting yourself in
            for?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Apparently a great deal of rudeness, Doctor
            Logue.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Call me Lionel.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I prefer Doctor.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I prefer Lionel. My family calls me far
            worse. What shall I call you?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            The Duke of York is appropriate.

<b>                          LIONEL
</b>            Oh please.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Your Royal Highness then.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Much more informal.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Prince Albert? Or Frederick? Arthur?
            George? I've lots of names to choose from.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            How about Bertie?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   23.


<b>                      BERTIE
</b>                (flushes)
            Only my family uses that.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            That's what I'll call you then. We must be
            true equals.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            If we were equal I wouldn't be here, I'd be
            at home with my family and no-one would
            give a damn.

Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Don't do that.

Bertie gives him an astonished look.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill
            you.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            My physicians say it's good for stuttering,
            relaxes the throat.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            They're idiots.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            They've all been knighted.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Makes it official then. House rules: no
            smoking.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I thought here we're "equal".

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            As a monarchist I thought you'd appreciate
            these are my digs and here I rule. No
            smoking. What was your earliest memory?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I beg your pardon?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            First recollection of the world?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     24.


<b>                      BERTIE
</b>                (stutter growing in
                 intensity)
            I'm not here to discuss personal matters.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Why're you here then?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>                (exploding)
            Because I bloody well stutter! And you
            bloody well can't fix it!!!

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>            Temper.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            One of my numerous faults.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Do you stutter when you think?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Don't be ridiculous.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            One of my many faults. How about when you
            talk to yourself?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I don't talk to myself!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Come on, everyone natters to themselves
            once in a while, Bertie.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Stop calling me that!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Shan't call you anything else.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Then we shan't speak!

Silence. The jug has boiled.    Lionel makes himself a cup of tea.

<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            Must I pay for this?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Loads. Now: when you talk to yourself, do
            you stutter?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   25.


<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Of course not!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Proving your impediment isn't a permanent
            internal fixture.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            When I give a speech...I bloody stutter!!!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly,
            right here, right now.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>                (bitterly)
            Easy money. You're on.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            See your shilling then.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Royals don't carry money.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            How convenient.

Logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            I'll stake you. Pay me back next time.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            If there is a next time.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on.

During this, Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a
recording device with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the
turntable and positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open
book. Bertie glares at it defiantly.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I certainly can't read The Bard.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            `Easy money'.

Bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>             "To be or not to be, That is the question.
            Whether it is wiser..." There!
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     26.


Reaches for the coin.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Not so fast.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I proved I can't read.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You proved you can't listen.

Hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones.    Bertie doesn't
want to take them.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            A princely bob is at stake.

Bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones. Logue turns a dial.
LOUD MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music
stops.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You're playing music.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>            I'm aware.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            How can I hear what I'm saying?!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Bertie, you're Royal. Surely a prince's
            brain knows what its mouth is doing?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You're not well acquainted with Royal
            princes, are you?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I want to demonstrate that when you can't
            hear your voice, you don't stutter, thus
            proving your impediment is not innate.

<b>                         BERTIE
</b>            Rubbish.

Bertie replaces the earphones. Again, the LOUD MUSIC. His lips

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>         Sing it.

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         Certainly not.
             (fascinated by the plane
              repairs)
         May I help? Always wanted to build models.
         Father wouldn't allow it. I had to collect
         stamps. He collected stamps.

<b>                   LIONEL
</b>         Only if you sing. Goes like this...
             (sings)
         "Way down upon the..."

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         I know the words!
             (sings)
         "Way down upon the Swanee River. ..."
         Etcetera.

<b>                   LIONEL
</b>         You didn't stutter.

<b>                    BERTIE
</b>         Of course I didn't stutter, I was singing!
         One doesn't stutter when one sings!
             (realises) )
         Oh...
             (then)
         Well I can't waltz around on State
         occasions warbling!

<b>                   LIONEL
</b>         You can with me.

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         That's because you're peculiar.

<b>                   LIONEL
</b>         I take that as a compliment. Cut some
         struts from the balsa. Sorry, hard to show
         you what to do at five paces. Would you
         like a cup of tea?

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         No. Yes. Thank you.

Lionel fires up the hot plate.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You were about to sing an aria concerning
            your brother.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I'm not crooning to the tune of "Swanee
            River!"

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Try "Camptown Races" then.
                (sings)
            "The Arch of C, he said to me, doo-dah doo-
            dah..." That sort of thing.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I can't talk, or sing, about your future
            King, doo-dah, doo-dah...

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            My future King? He's your future King too.
            Did that cause friction? Knowing he'd grow
            up to be King, but you wouldn't.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Certainly not. I've always looked up to
            David. Water's boiling.

Lionel makes the pot.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Two lumps or one?

Bertie, a bit abashed, holds up three fingers.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I've a sweet tooth. To tell the truth...

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Always preferable.
                (referring to plane wing)
            Cover it with tissue.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            ...it was a relief. Knowing I wouldn't be
            King.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Why's that?

Lionel hands him a mug of tea.   Bertie realizes it's chipped and
possibly none too clean.

Reaches into his jacket for his cigarette case.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            No smoking. What's the age difference?

While Logue isn't looking, Bertie surreptitiously wipes the rim
of the mug with his handkerchief.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Eighteen months.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            But for eighteen months you would've been
            King?!

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>            We didn't think about it that way, doctor.
                (sings)
            Doo-dah doo-dah.
                (then)
            David and I were very close.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            As you said: eighteen months.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            As brothers!

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>            How close?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Young bucks... You know.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I don't, or I wouldn't ask. Did you go
            after the same girls?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Upon occasion.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Princess Elizabeth?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>                (flares)
            What an extraordinarily rude thing to say!
                (quickly under control)
            David did try to be her beau at one point.
            Before I met her. She wouldn't have him.

<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            Not like my father...he and his brother,
            when they were young, kept a girl in St
            John's Wood and shared her on alternate
            nights.

An uncomfortable silence.   Too much has been said.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Now dope the other wing. Did David tease
            you?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            They all did. "Buh-buh-buh-Bertie". Father
            encouraged it. "Spit it out, boy!" Thought
            it would make me stop. Is this necessary?!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Otherwise the paint will eat through the
            tissue.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I mean the damn questions!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Mandatory. Tell me more about your
            storybook childhood. What was your earliest
            memory?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You asked that before.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            This time I'd like an answer.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Being born.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            How can you remember that?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            December 14th.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I don't understand.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            "Mausoleum Day". Prince Albert departed on
            that date. I was named Bertie to placate
            Great Grandmamma Victoria. In return, she
            hated me because it reminded her of her
            grief.

<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            Let's stick to medical history please. I'm
            naturally left handed, which was considered
            inappropriate.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>            And?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I was punished. Now I'm right handed.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Anything else?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Bandy legs. Also considered inappropriate.

Lionel waits.

<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            Metal splints were made...worn night and
            day...very painful. Now I have straight
            legs. This is so...tawdry! I need your
            services as a Speech Therapist, not Grand
            Inquisitor. Are you available? Or will it
            be: "Myrtle says no?"

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You sound angry.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Yes, I told you, I have a temper.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Angry at me, or at your brother?

Bertie remains stubbornly silent.    Then blurts:

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            He's fallen in love!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            How dreadful.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            With the wrong sort of woman!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            What's wrong with her?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            She's American.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Some of them must be lovable.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            This one's divorced. Twice. Mrs Wallis
            Simpson of Baltimore. I want David to be
            happy, but the family, the Church, the
            nation, won't have it.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Can't they fornicate privately like adults?

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>            If only! David used to prefer married women
            because there was no possible attachment.
            But now...

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            "Queen Wallis of Baltimore"?

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>            Please.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Does sound a bit iffy.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I made a smudge!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Touch it up.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You want me to beg for help?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I advise you never to beg. Especially if
            you might be King.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Don't say that!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I see. For reasons you cannot disclose,
            fearing ramifications you will not explain,
            you feel sufficiently anxious to embark
            upon a course of therapy in which you have
            no faith? You already owe me a shilling.

Bertie takes a coin out of his pocket, hesitates, then offers it
to Logue.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I brought it along. You won, fair and
            square. I'll pay you generously.

Lionel pockets the coin.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I'll continue to ask questions.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            That's what I was afraid of.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>                (admires the plane)
            Nice job.

Bertie sees Lionel glance at his watch.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You've someone waiting?

<b>                        LIONEL
</b>            I do now.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I'd apologize to them in person, but...

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You don't wish to be seen? Slip out the
            back way.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            After the funeral...it may be even more
            difficult. To remain unobserved.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You're having second thoughts.

Bertie's silence is confirmation.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)

            We live in South Kensington, small
            apartment, but no one would see you.
                (added incentive)
            Lots of planes.

<b>                      BERTIE

                   when I ride through the streets and see a
                   `bloke' I'm struck by how little I know of
                   his life, and how little he knows of mine.
                   Cuts both ways.

     As Bertie is about to leave, Lionel requests casually:

<b>                             LIONEL
</b>                   And if you decide to come, bring the

<b>                              BERTIE
</b>                   She might. If I asked. Very nicely.
                       (at back door)

                       (pause)
                   After the funeral then?

     Bertie doesn't answer. Exits. Logue is left holding the plane.
     He goes to the waiting room door.

During this, INTERCUT to the REVERSE ANGLE, showing a massive
military parade, mainly Navy personnel, wending its way through
the main street of Windsor towards the Castle, accompanying a
gun carriage on which rides the King's coffin, draped with the
Royal standard, on which rests the Royal Crown topped by a
Maltese Cross.

David is seen - very serious.

            David is now become our only lawful King.

Canons are fired.

Startled by the salute, a large flock of blackbirds rise up and
streak across the wintery sky.

A MURMUR, then a shocked GASP, as the gun carriage transverses a
tram track and tilts precipitously. Suddenly the Royal Crown
tumbles and falls, knocking off the Maltese Cross.

            You're well aware, of course, George IV's
            wife, Mrs. Fitzherbert, was very common
            indeed...and previously married. She signed
            an agreement that she could never become
            Queen, and their children could not be
            Royal. A rather sensible morganatic
            arrangement.

     In the store Myrtle can be seen dressing the window, while in
     his glass office the OWNER, a portly bald gentleman with a
     Dickensian air, is deep in concerned conversation with a man in
     trench-coat. The Owner keeps glancing worriedly in Myrtle's
     direction.

     leaves. The owner beckons another shop-girl over and whispers
     something to her. She heads towards Myrtle.

               you turned it into quite something else.
               What happened, Lionel? We went to Wembley
               Stadium, next thing...you'd cashed in our

confidentially.

            cause no sort of embarrassment, for it
            causes none to him who speaks." You see,

     The last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang.
     He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a
     director preparing the stage for a final scene. He quotes
     Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself:

     He exits.

     THE CAMERA explores various elements:

     The Throne of Edward the Confessor.

     Beneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone.

     Leaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for the next
     Coronation rehearsal.

     Majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs.

     Rows of pews, worn with centuries of use.

     Graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen.

     This Abbey holds the history of a nation.

     Footsteps resonate.

     Lionel enters.   Trips over one of the gravestones.

</b>          When the war came, by the time I was ready
          to be shipped out, the first casualties
          were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in
          bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with
          your mouth, see if you can help these poor
          sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest.
          Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than
          you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I
          found I had to go deeper, as you might well
          imagine.

</b>          I think you do. They had cried out, and the
          universe had not listened. So they'd lost
          faith in their voice. My job was to make
          them shout in righteous anger: "I have the

            I simply knew what to do. When the war was
            over I kept being a therapist to earn a
            living. When the lads were old enough, I
            thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always
            wanted to be an actor, one last go." I
            pretended it was our trip home to Mother
            England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage.

     for this all-important occasion.

The BBC News Reader and Floor Manager are there, along with a
small cluster of technicians putting finishing touches to their
equipment.

The Floor Manager tries to warn him with his eyes.

Bertie has entered with Elizabeth and Logue. The Reader wishes
he could sink into the floor. Bertie says nothing, but
approaches the looming microphone, while Logue and Elizabeth
watch nervously.

the little finger, thumb to chin.

The Reader scurries off and tells the others.

</b>            No matter how this turns out, I wish to

            Understood.

Bertie takes something from his pocket.

<b>                      BERTIE

The object is a silver medal. Bertie pins it to Logue's jacket.

A very long pause.

<b>                         BERTIE
</b>            Almost.

The red light on the microphone starts to blink.   Logue joins
the others.

The Reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc `broadcast
booth. Five, four, three, two...

            Buckingham Palace. His Majesty, the King.

During this, Bertie's hands begin to shake, the pages of his
speech rattle like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the
Adam's apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms
reappear.

Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished.   It
seems an eternity.

Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles.

Lang's eyes roll heavenward.

Churchill studies the situation, ready to leap into the breach.

Bertie and Logue stare at each other.

Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man he's
worked with. His confidence is contagious.

Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. His hands
grow steady, his throat muscles relax...all the things he's
practiced.

                  you myself. For the second time in the
                  lives of most of us we are at war. For we
                  are called, with our allies, to meet the
                  challenge of a principle which, if it were
                  to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized
                  order in the world. It is the principle
                  which permits a State, in the selfish
                  pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties
                  and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the
                  use of force, or threat of force, against
                  the sovereignty and independence of other
                  States. Such a principle, stripped of all
                  disguise, is surely the mere primitive
                  doctrine that might is right, and if this
                  principle were established throughout the
                  world, the freedom of our own country and
                  of the whole British Commonwealth of
                  Nations would be in danger.

                  stand calm, firm, and united in this time

                  be dark days ahead, and war can no longer
                  be confined to the battlefield. But we can

</b>                  If one and all we keep resolutely faithful
                  to it, ready for whatever service or
                  sacrifice it may demand, then, with God's
                  help, we shall prevail.

     Lilibet's expression tells it all - she can hear it, her father
     is truly King.

     Bertie, in his quiet way is totally in command, and utterly
     magnificent. Everyone in the room is awed as he concludes:
  TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   114.


<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            We may all find a message of encouragement
            in the lines which, in my closing words, I
            would like to say to you: `I said to the
            man who stood at the Gate of the Year,
            "Give me a light that I may tread safely
            into the unknown." And he replied, "Go out
            into the darkness, and put your hand into
            the Hand of God. That shall be to you
            better than light, and safer than a known
            way.'" May the Almighty Hand guide and
            uphold us all.

IN THE AD HOC `CONTROL BOOTH' AREA - the Manager makes a `cut'
gesture to Bertie, he's off the air, the red light on the
microphone goes out. The Manager points, and the red light on
the Reader's microphone goes on.

<b>                      BBC NEWS READER
</b>            This concludes the BBC broadcast of the
            King's Speech.

Another `cut' gesture from the Floor Manager, the red light goes
out and the transmission is concluded. The Floor Manager looks
to the Reader.

            He wasn't perfect.
                (barely controlling his
                 tears)
            Not perfect... But by God... He moved me.

AT THE MAIN BBC MICROPHONE - Bertie waits for the verdict of his
peers. Churchill first:

<b>                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>            Couldn't have said it better myself.

The ultimate compliment.   Lang next.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            I'm speechless.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>                (softly)
            Thank God.

She goes to Bertie and kisses him tenderly on the cheek, takes
his hand, then Logue's.
  TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   115.


<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>            Well done, Bertie. Well done...
                (for the first time)
            ...Lionel. Well done.

She leaves the two men together.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I always called you Bertie. Today, I call
            you King.

He offers his hand. But instead of taking it, Bertie takes him
by the shoulders and gives him a hug. This is a long way from
the five pace rule. The last barrier has fallen.
