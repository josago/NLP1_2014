<b>FADE IN:
</b>
CLOSE on a Polaroid of a dimly lit COUPLE locked in a sexual
embrace. We cannot see their faces.

<b>                     MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
</b>               (tortured)
           God grant me the Serenity to accept
           the things I cannot change...

Our view travels sensuously down the Woman's naked torso to
find the Man's head buried between her legs.

<b>                     MARSHALL (V.O.)
</b>           Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?

<b>                     MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
</b>           Courage to change the things I
           can...

<b>                     MARSHALL (V.O.)
</b>           Come on, you've been a good boy for
           a long time, you deserve a little
           fun.

Our view moves back up to the Woman's breasts.

</b><b>                                            THIS TO:
</b>
EARL BROOKS' reflection in a mirror. Earl, in his 40's, has
on a tuxedo. He's in front of a sink in a Public Bathroom and
he's whispering to his image.

<b>                     MR. BROOKS
</b>           ... and Wisdom to know the
           difference.

Picking up speed against the hunger in his head:

<b>                     MR. BROOKS (CONT'D)
</b>           Living one day at a time, Enjoying
           one moment at a time, Accepting
           hardship as a pathway to peace...

From far away comes the sound of applause.

<b>INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
MEN in tuxedos and WOMEN in gowns.

Mr. Brooks is seated at one of the front tables with his
wife, EMMA, also 40's.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

The audience's hands are coming together for what a MAN at
the microphone has just said.

Mr. Brooks is smiling but not clapping; and although his lips
don't move we can hear:

<b>                       MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
</b>                 (even faster now)
             ... Taking, as He did, this sinful
             world as it is, not as I would have
             it. Trusting that He will make all
             things right if I surrender to His
             will. That I may be reasonably
             happy in this life, And supremely
             happy with Him forever in the next.
             Amen.

The Man at the microphone raises his arms to quiet the
Audience.

<b>                       MAN
</b>             I could go on and on about what a
             great guy Earl is, how he cuts his
             toe nails...

Everyone laughs.

<b>                       MAN
</b>             ... how he gives freely of his time
             and money, but let's get Earl up
             here to speak for himself. Ladies
             and Gentlemen, I give you a
             businessman, a philanthropist, a
             great friend and the Evanston
             Chamber of Commerce Man of the
             Year... Mr. Earl Brooks.

Mr. Brooks kisses Emma, stands and after accepting
congratulations along the way, arrives at the podium.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Thank you all very much. The first
             thing I would like to say is... I
             don't even know how I cut my toe
             nails.

Applause and laughter from the Audience.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Twenty years ago when I started the
             Brooks Box Factory I never dreamed
             I would one day be standing here.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
A silver Lexus LS 430 glides past us.

<b>                    EMMA (V.O.)
</b>          Did you see Sis Wallace's dress?

<b>INT. LEXUS Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks is driving. Emma is in the passenger seat. They're
holding hands.

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          You could see her nipples. At her
          age she should keep those things
          hidden.

Mr. Brooks is only listening to his Wife with one ear and
underneath what she is saying we can barely hear:

<b>                    MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
</b>          God grant me the Serenity to
          accept...

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          The only thing that would have made
          this evening more perfect is if
          Jane had been here.

<b>                     MR. BROOKS
</b>          She called. She has mid terms
          coming up.

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          She's dropping out, you know.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>          We'll see.

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          Nothing she does is wrong to you,
          is it?...

Mr. Brooks doesn't rise to the bait.

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          Well she missed a good party...

As she continues, we look at Mr. Brooks and Emma's voice
fades to a murmur.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

In the back seat, a Man leans out from behind Mr. Brooks's
head. This is MARSHALL. He's 50 plus.

Emma can neither see nor hear him. Marshall exists only in
Mr. Brooks's mind.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             Come on, Earl, give yourself a
             break, you know you want to do
             this.

<b>                        MR. BROOKS
</b>             No.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             You're the fucking 'man of the
             year', you deserve it. It's not
             like it's not set up. You already
             know how to by-pass the alarm, you
             know how to pick the locks.
             Tonight's the perfect night.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>                 (over his shoulder)
             No, Marshall, I said 'no'!

<b>                        MARSHALL
</b>             I heard you, Earl, but you don't
             mean 'no'.

Emma feels Mr. Brooks's distance.

<b>                       EMMA
</b>             What's the matter?

Mr. Brooks pulls himself back into the moment.

<b>                        MR. BROOKS
</b>             Nothing.

<b>                       EMMA
</b>             You were frowning.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             I was thinking of what I didn't say
             in the speech.

<b>                       EMMA
</b>             They laughed, they were touched, I
             don't think anyone felt left out.

</b>

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>              (from the back seat)
          They have their dance class
          tonight. What if we go by and just
          look at them. There's no harm in
          just having a look.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          No means 'no', Marshall.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          Please... pretty please.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>              (to Emma)
          The food tonight was very good, but
          I wasn't crazy about the dessert.
          Would you like to stop somewhere
          and get something sweet?

<b>INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR Ñ NIGHT
</b>
In a booth, Mr. Brooks and Emma are sharing a Sundae. Mr.
Brooks steals a look at the Arthur Murray dance class that is
taking place behind the full-length windows fronting the
second floor of the Building across the street.

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          ... Labradors are supposed to be
          nice, or maybe a rescue mutt...

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          The Pound's a pretty sad place; if
          you want me to, I'll go with you.

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          There's an Irish Lab I read about,
          and I think the breeder is...

Mr. Brooks turns his attention back to the Dancers and again
Emma's voice fades to a murmur.

Both Mr. Brooks and Marshall who is seated on the other side
of Emma are focused on one particular COUPLE.

The Man and Woman are not great dancers nor are they
especially attractive, but Mr. Brooks and Marshall are
fascinated with them.

Marshall leans forward and looking slyly around Emma at Mr.
Brooks:



<b>                                                  (CONTINUED)

</b><b>                                                          6.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             I bet your dick's getting hard,
             isn't it, just imagining what they
             would look like dead?

Savoring the ice-cream, Mr. Brooks nods.

<b>EXT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Two story modern. Not ostentatious, but the elegance of the
line and the grounds say there's big money here.

<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Through the door of the DRESSING AREA, Emma can be seen
taking off her evening clothes.

Hidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed, Mr.
Brooks is hunched forward on a chair, his head in his hands.
His bow tie is undone, but he's still wearing his Tuxedo. In
obvious torment, he is whispering to himself.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             ... I can't do this, I can't do
             this, I can't do this, please don't
             let me do this, God grant me the
             Serenity to accept the things I
             cannot change...

In the DRESSING AREA

Emma is putting on her sleep-wear. Mr. Brooks steps into the
doorway.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             I'm going to stay up a while, maybe
             go to the studio and play with some
             glazes.

<b>                       EMMA
</b>             Okay, I'm going to read. If I'm not
             awake, wake me when you come back.

Mr. Brooks comes forward, puts his arms around Emma and hugs
her, then easing back, kisses her.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             I thought you were wonderful
             tonight.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           7.
</b>


<b>EXT. THE BROOKS HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks exits the back door and starts down a path that
leads away from the house.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>              (to himself)
          Don't do this, don't do this,
          please don't do this, don't do
          this, don't do, please don't do
          this...

He passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small
beautiful industrial-looking Building.

No windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just
under the edge of the roof.

Mr. Brooks lets himself in with a key.

<b>INT. BUILDING Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Exquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups,
plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around
the room.

This is Mr. Brooks's CERAMICS STUDIO.

Mr. Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the
temperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of
his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a
dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a
closet.

Below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical
leather work shoes. The windbreaker he puts on is also from a
dozen identical windbreakers.

He takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which
opens into a garage. Under the light is an older model non-
descript Toyota.

<b>EXT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT
</b>
The Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door
closing behind it, pulls away.

<b>INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Marshall is up front with Mr. Brooks.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed
             this! We are going to have so much
             fun!

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             This is the last time, Marshall.
             Understand me?! The very last time!

<b>EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET Ñ NIGHT
</b>
A mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. Mr.
Brooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree.

We rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the
other side of the block and come down to find Mr. Brooks
working the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW.

He has on surgical gloves.

The pick is extracted, the handle turned. The door opens.
There's a chain.

Mr. Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from
a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives
the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward.

The chain has been released.

<b>INT. BUNGALOW Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath
stands very still and listens.

There's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of
the house.

Mr. Brooks's feet glide out of the PANTRY. Now coming
slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark
slacks.

Move up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall.

In the middle of the KITCHEN, the sound is now recognizable.
It's the moans of a Couple fucking. This disturbs Mr. Brooks,
he hesitates.

Marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear.




<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             Don't you dare quit on me, you
             piece of shit. I want to see what
             they're doing.

Mr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again.

Entering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his hand
reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the
butt of a silenced pistol.

He brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the
Ziplock against his wrist.

The two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind it
the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense.

Mr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for
he and Marshall to see the Couple inside.

The Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are
naked on the bed.

As much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching.
He can now hear his heart beating in his ears.

He begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his
expression is distant almost clinical.

When the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face
goes blank.

On the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of
them lie there basking in the afterglow.

Behind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips
into the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Hello.

Both the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look. The Woman
screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself.

<b>                       MAN
</b>             What the fuck?!

Then he sees the gun.

<b>                       MAN
</b>             Hey, man, don't...

</b>

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>              (to the Woman)
          Be quiet and sit up.

In an attempt to get away, the Woman pushes herself back
against the wall. She can't take her eyes off Mr. Brooks and
she can't stop screaming.

POP! A hole appears above her left eye. The impact of Mr.
Brooks's High Velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the
wall. The screaming stops.

The Man opens his mouth and begins to shake. POP! The bullet
through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples
onto the Girl.

Mr. Brooks looks at what he's done. His nostrils flare at the
scent of death. Then he moves, he's got work to do. On his
way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket.

<b>                    MARSHALL (O.S.)
</b>              (barks)
          Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is
          this?!!

Mr. Brooks snaps a look.

The curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of
the Apartments in a four story Building on the other side of
an alley can see into this room.

Most of their windows are dark. And there's no one looking
out of the windows that are lit.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          These pigs liked to fuck with the
          blinds open, you should have known
          that, Earl. This is a big mistake
          for you, Earl.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>              (going to the window)
          Almost like I want to get caught,
          huh, Marshall?

<b>                     MARSHALL
</b>          Well, don't fucking do that. I
          don't think either of us would
          enjoy spending the rest of our
          lives in jail or a lethal
          injection.

<b>                      MR. BROOKS

He grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the
curtains closed.

<b>                                         CUT TO:
</b>
CLOSE on a Polaroid of the dance Couple in a sexual pose. The
attitude of the bodies is awkward and very reminiscent of the
ones in the Polaroid we opened the movie with.

<b>INT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks is kneeling naked in front of the kiln where his
murder clothes are being reduced to ash.

Arranged on the floor are Polaroids of the dance Couple in
sexual positions.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Please forgive me... Please forgive
          me...

As we look closer at the Photographs we realize by a smear of
blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that
these tableaus were arranged after the Couple was killed.

One by one, Mr. Brooks picks up his souvenirs. He lingers
over the last image; and from where he's sitting on the edge
of a table:

<b>                     MARSHALL
</b>          Don't even think about it. You know
          the rules.

Reluctantly Mr. Brooks throws the Polaroids into the fire of
the kiln.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          Now go up and make love to your
          beautiful wife.

He leaves. In the kiln, the Polaroids burst into flame.

<b>EXT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ AFTERNOON

The sunlight exposes its charm.

If it weren't for the Police tape, the UNIFORMED OFFICERS,
and the PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES, it looks like it would be a
cool place to live.

An OLDER DETECTIVE, an African-American, comes out on the
porch and calls to two other DETECTIVES who are drinking
coffee on the lawn:

<b>                       OLDER DETECTIVE
</b>             Where the fuck is Atwood?!

<b>                       YOUNG DETECTIVE
</b>             I called ten minutes ago, they said
             she was on her way.

<b>                       OLDER DETECTIVE
</b>             She doesn't get here soon, these
             bodies won't even be dead anymore?

A Uniformed Cop standing guard at the tape:

<b>                       COP
</b>             You looking for the lady Cop?

<b>                       OLDER DETECTIVE
</b>             Yeah.

<b>                       COP
</b>             She's here. She's been sitting in
             her car right over there for the
             last half hour.

<b>                       OLDER DETECTIVE
</b>             Oh, Christ.

<b>EXT. ATWOOD'S CAR Ñ AFTERNOON
</b>
Special Detective TRACY ATWOOD, somewhere in her 30's, is
behind the wheel. The door is open.

By the expression on her face we might guess that Detective
Atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car.

On the seat next to her is a copy of the Chicago Tribune. The
headline of a middle article on the first page reads: THE
<b>HANGMAN ESCAPES.
</b>
Move up to Atwood's face. The Older Detective followed by the
Younger Detective approaches.

<b>                       OLDER DETECTIVE
</b>             You thinking of joining us anytime
             soon, Atwood?

Atwood doesn't look at the Detectives for a long beat and
when she does her expression is not friendly.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             I really hated yesterday, Snyder,
             and then today came along.

As she gets out of the car, the Men notice the bandages on
her wrists and falling into step with her on the way to the
house.

<b>                       SNYDER (OLDER DETECTIVE)
</b>             What happened to your wrists?

Atwood holds up her hands to reveal the extent of the
bandages.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             I tried to commit suicide.

The Young Detective laughs. Atwood whirls on him.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             What's so funny?

<b>                       YOUNG DETECTIVE
</b>             Eh... I... I don't know, I heard it
             was because you were drunk and got
             into a fight with a fish tank.

Atwood sticks her finger into the Young Detective's chest.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Who are you gonna believe? Me or

<b>                          DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Atwood turns and leaves the Men.

<b>                       YOUNG DETECTIVE
</b>                 (under his breath)
             She's nuts!

<b>                          SNYDER
</b>             And rich.

They catch up to Atwood who has squatted down to examine the
lock on the front door.

<b>                    SNYDER
</b>          There are some scratches in the
          side door cylinder. Other than that
          no signs of forced entry. The alarm
          was armed and we even had to cut
          the security chains to get in.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>              (straightens up)
          This guy hasn't been active for
          over two years...

She enters the house.

<b>INT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ AFTERNOON
</b>
From the way Atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses
the Living Room we get the feel that this Woman misses
nothing.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          ... we think he's either dead or in
          jail on some other charge. This is
          probably a copycat.

Detective Snyder points her down the Hall toward the Bedroom
and follows.

<b>                    SNYDER
</b>          That's why we called you. You're
          the God that tells us peons if we
          have a simple murder here or
          something we can dump on you.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Bite yourself.

Atwood arrives in the doorway of the BEDROOM where the
murders took place and stops.

The Bodies of the dance Couple are now on the floor. The Man
is propped up against the bed in a sitting position. The
Woman has her head in the Man's crotch.

Almost like Mr. Brooks, Atwood's nostrils flare, but in
Atwood's case it's not the scent of death that arouses her
but it's like she's searching for the scent of her prey.

In a glance she memorizes the Room, then steps inside.

<b>INT. BEDROOM Ñ AFTERNOON

The Crime Scene TECHNICIANS shift to accommodate Atwood's
inspection.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>              (indicating the Victims)
          He always rearranges the bodies,
          but this is out of character. He
          has never left them in such a crude
          position. Usually it's more
          romantic with their arms around
          each other, kissing, their mouths
          open, their tongues touching.

<b>                    SNYDER
</b>          So we have a copycat?

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Where are the thumbprints?

Snyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed. Atwood
leans in to look at two bloody 'thumbprints' placed side by
side.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          One his one hers?

<b>                    SNYDER
</b>          That's what it looks like.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          What's that?

There are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall.

<b>                     SNYDER
</b>          The bullets went completely through
          the victims. The killer recovered
          the slugs.

Atwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to
the window and cracks the curtains.

There's the four story Apartment Building across the alley,
its windows staring down at her.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Were these open or closed when you

Atwood tries the cord, the curtains are stuck.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Hmm...

She returns her attention to the murder scene.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             It has never been revealed to the
             public that the Thumbprint Killer
             retrieves the slugs.

<b>                       SNYDER
</b>             So this one's yours.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             I don't fucking need this.

She doubles back and cracks the curtains for another look at
the four story Apartment Building.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Have you checked the tenants of
             that building?

<b>                       SNYDER
</b>             Only a few of them are home, they
             say they didn't see anything. We
             checked the whole neighborhood, so
             far nobody saw a thing.

Atwood nods and turns back to the bodies.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Leaving them like this, he must
             have been angry at them for some
             reason.

She reaches down and runs a hand over the carpet.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Where would they keep their vacuum
             cleaner.

A puzzled Snyder follows her out of the room.

<b>INT. PANTRY Ñ AFTERNOON

Atwood opens a service closet. There's the Vacuum Cleaner.

Atwood unzips the cover. There is no bag inside.

</b>             He vacuumed the house and took the

<b>EXT. ALLEY Ñ AFTERNOON

Detective Atwood is standing on an empty capped plastic
gallon milk carton looking over the fence into the back yard
of the Murder House. Snyder has his hand on her back to
steady her.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Okay.

He releases her. She hops down and directs her attention at
the four story Apartment Building.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Our best hope is if someone in

A MAN comes out from behind the next door fence and strides
purposefully toward them.

A YOUNG WOMAN, 19, is dropped off along with an assortment of
luggage and boxes.

<b>INT. BROOKS BOX FACTORY Ñ DAY

It's loud. We follow a thin piece of cardboard as one machine
deals it off the bottom of a stack into the maw of another
machine.

That machine prints one side of the cardboard blue.

It is handed off to the third machine which cuts the flaps.
The fourth machine folds and glues those flaps and spits the
piece of cardboard out onto a conveyor belt as a box.

Wearing safety glasses and ear protectors along with his
business suit, Mr. Brooks picks up the box and hands it to
one of three similarly attired MEN, standing nearby.

</b>             I'm sorry, Daddy, please don't be
             angry with me.

Mr. Brooks kisses Jane on the forehead and goes to sit at his
desk.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             I can guess what you've done, but
             why don't you tell me and then I'll
             decide.

<b>                       JANE
</b>             I dropped out of school.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Okay. Have you told your mother
             this?

<b>                       JANE
</b>             No. I wanted to speak to you first.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             You'll have to tell her, I'm not
             going to do that for you, and then
             together the three of us will
             decide where to go from here.

<b>                       JANE
</b>             I've thought a lot about this, Dad.
             College is a waste of time for me.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             I don't know how you know that half
             way through your Freshman year,
             but...

<b>                       JANE
</b>             You didn't go to college, Dad, and
             you're successful. I want to come
             and work for you.

          I'm not hiring right now.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Just listen to me. What would
          happen to the business if, God
          forbid, something happened to you?
          Mom would probably have to sell to
          strangers. I'm willing to start at
          the bottom, you can treat me as a
          regular employee, I want to learn
          everything there is to know about
          running the box business, and then
          when the time comes, the business
          would stay in the family.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          That's sweet, but you're talking
          about emotion, not business. In
          fact your mother and I came very
          close to selling out last year.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          What?!

</b>          If we had been offered a little
          more money, and they may come back
          to us, we will sell.

There's a knock on the door.

Sunday, the secretary, comes in and crossing to Mr. Brooks:

<b>                    MR. BROOKS

She leaves. Slicing the flap of the envelope, Mr. Brooks
picks up with Jane.

Mr. Brooks can now see the contents of the envelope.

Two snapshot-size PHOTOS taken with a high speed digital
camera. One shows the right side of Mr. Brooks's cheek.

He is in no way identifiable, but that blur of flesh appears
to be looking at the dead dance Couple.

The second Photo is a clear shot of Mr. Brooks closing the
curtains with the dead dance Couple behind him.

Neither Mr. Brooks's voice or his face betray the enormity of
what he's looking at.

He picks up the phone and holds it out to Jane.

A different angle in the same hallway shows Mr. Brooks
walking away from us. A passing EMPLOYEE crosses him. The Men
nod to each other. Marshall is nowhere in sight.

And then we're back to the original angle and Marshall is
again in the picture.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             ... That's why I didn't want to do

             bright side, he came to us he
             didn't go to the Cops. If he tries
             to shake us down we kill him.
             Period. We make it fun but we kill
             him. End of story.

The Man from the Reception Area is nervously admiring a

of the door opening behind.

</b>             I've been watching that Couple for
             months, they liked to make love
             with the blinds open. Sometimes I
             would take pictures, you know,
             visual aides for later. It was fun,
             it was a great way to get off; I
             thought, until I saw you kill them.
             I have to tell you I have never
             ever felt a rush like that ever. I
             know you're the Thumbprint killer,
             you've done this before. What I
             want is to go with you the next
             time you kill someone. And I would
             like that to be soon.

From the end of the table, Marshall cackles a laugh.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             And you were worried that this was
             going to be unpleasant. The answer
             is simple. Just tell him you've
             decided never to kill again and
             he'll go away.

          pictures?

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          He put them in a safety deposit box
          but I'll bet the box is at the bank
          where he has his checking account

          anguish that being in close

          him.

          went through being in close

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Yes, we do. I was the one who paid
          for everything while we were
          married, and now I'm being asked to
          give him a bonus for spending time
          with me when I've already paid for

          Tracy, this is not a lot of money
          for you, and you know how upset I
          was when Meeks said that he was
          going to escape and he would come
          back and kill you.

<b>INT. APARTMENT Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Moonlight seeps around the blinds to reveal Mr. Smith asleep
in bed.

Beyond the open BEDROOM door down the hall is only darkness
until the eruption of illumination from a penlight
momentarily outlines the figure of a Man.

Then we're looking at what the penlight sees.

A keyring. Hands in surgical gloves isolate the - safety
deposit key - and press it into a soft wax block where it
leaves its impression. The light goes off.

In the BEDROOM at the end of the hallway, Mr. Smith begins to
snore. The Figure coasts silently toward the sound.

Mr. Smith's face is sideways on the pillow. The snores and a
little drool burbles out of the corner of his mouth.

WHOOMP!! The impact of something landing on the bed bounces
Mr. Smith upright and awake.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!!

The beam from the penlight hits him in the face. He raises
his hands to shield his eyes.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Don't worry, if I were here to kill
          you, you would already be dead.

The penlight leaves Mr. Smith and Mr. Brooks places it
deliberately under his own chin casting long sinister shadows
up his face. He's sitting on the bed next to Mr. Smith.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          After you left today, I realized
          our friendship was a little one-
          sided.

</b><b>                       MR. BROOKS (CONT'D)
</b>             So when we meet tomorrow night
             would you be so kind as to bring
             all of the pictures and the memory
             card from your camera. That way we
             can like each other simply for who
             we are. If you don't show up, I
             will presume you've gone to the
             police and I will kill you. Even if
             I go to jail because of you,
             someone will find you wherever you
             are and kill you.

The penlight goes off. There's total silence.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>                 (squeaks)
             Mr. Brooks?...

He squints into the black.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Mr. Brooks?...

Finally he gathers the courage to extend a shaky hand. The
bedside lamp goes on. The room is empty. Cautiously Mr. Smith
swings his legs out of bed and stands up.

He forces himself to go to the door and from there curls his
arm around the jamb into the darkness.

The HALL light is dazzling.

A peek into the BATHROOM shows there is nobody there. He
continues on into the LIVING ROOM.

His camera equipment is on the table. The tripod is still set
up. There is no sign of Mr. Brooks.

Mr. Smith eyes the front door. It's closed and the 'security
chain' is in place!!

Another quick scan of the room. It sure seems that he's
alone.

He opens the front door the length of the chain and looks up
and down the hallway. It's empty. Slowly he closes the door.

Standing in the light of his LIVING ROOM, Mr. Smith is more
scared and strangely more excited than he's ever been in his
life.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Wow!...

<b>INT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
</b>
In a robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks comes down the HALLWAY
carrying a glass of milk. The door to his Daughter's ROOM is
partly open. By the nightlight in the plug at the head of the
bed he can see she's asleep.

<b>INT. BEDROOM Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks walks to the bed, leans over and kisses his
Daughter on the cheek.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>                 (quietly)
             It's nice to have you home.

He leaves.

<b>EXT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ MORNING

A garbage truck is picking up the trash.

<b>INT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ MORNING

Dressed for work and a smile on his face, Mr. Brooks comes
down the stairs.

In the BREAKFAST ROOM, the mood is decidedly different. His
Wife and Daughter are leaning against opposite walls staring
at the floor.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS

Mr. Brooks looks directly at his Daughter.

</b>             There will be no abortion.

Large and small Color Photographs pinned to a corkboard
create a Collage of the dance Couple murder scene.

Standing in front of this is CAPTAIN LISTER, a tall slim open-
faced Woman in her mid-fifties, and the lead Crime Scene
Technician we saw earlier at the Murder House.

             There's not a trace of anything

             I'd say these people were killed by

<b>INT. HALLWAY Ñ CRIME LAB Ñ AFTERNOON
</b>
Atwood is waiting for an elevator. It arrives. The doors
open. The car is empty.

<b>INT. ELEVATOR Ñ AFTERNOON
</b>
Atwood gets in and presses the key for her destination, then
slumps into a corner for the ride. The doors close. The
elevator begins to move.

All at once Atwood screams. Her pent-up anger and frustration
rip the air and she goes nuts.

She punches the wall of the elevator, kicks it, throws
herself to the other side, bangs her head against that wall,
punches it, kicks it, all the while screaming.

Then the tears come. The screams stop and she settles upright
against the back wall, where she strikes her chest repeatedly
with the flat of her closed hand.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          What is wrong with me? What is
          wrong with me? What is wrong with

<b>EXT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
</b>
It's raining. The yellow Police tape that still circles the
yard snaps in the wind.

</b>

Up the driveway, out of sight of all the other homes, there's
a movement at the side door of the house.

A closer inspection reveals that it's Detective Atwood. From
under her umbrella she studies her surroundings and as if
she's speaking to the killer, she speaks to herself.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Did you choose them because of
             where they lived or how they looked
             or what jobs they had? Or did you
             just pick them because at the
             instant you saw them, you had
             decided to kill someone? The side
             door was perfect. No one could see
             you pick the lock.

With a key she lets herself in.

<b>EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Parked against the curb opposite the driveway of the Murder
House is an old green Pontiac Convertible with the top up.

The driver's window is down and from inside a WOMAN, late
20's, is watching the house.

<b>INT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Atwood stops in the PANTRY almost in the exact spot where Mr.
Brooks stopped.

The quiet is filled by the rain drumming on the roof. The
wind rattles the windows.

<b>                        DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             How did you know where they were in
             the house?

She steps into the KITCHEN. On the way across she bumps into
a chair.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             It's darker tonight than it was on
             your night. But still how did you
             manage not to bump into the
             furniture? Did you have a little
             light? That would be too dangerous.
             I'll bet you were in the house
             before.

</b>             So I should ask the neighbors if
             they saw a meter reader around the
             house or a telephone repairman or
             someone from the gas company.

These musings take her through the LIVING ROOM to the
entrance of the HALLWAY where she pauses and looks both ways.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Once again, how did you know where
             they were? Did you check the rooms
             before you found them? She had his
             semen in her vagina, they had just
             made love, did you hear them or was
             there a light on?

She steps into the HALL.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             And when did you bag the gun?
             Because even though I'm sure you're
             an expert at it, there's still a
             chance of noise from the plastic.

She continues down the HALL to the BEDROOM.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Was the door open or did you have
             to open it?

She opens the door and goes in.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Were they asleep or awake? Was the
             light on, or did you turn it on?
             Because I know you, you wouldn't
             risk a shot in the dark.

She turns on the overhead light.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Too bright. What if it wasn't that
             light that was on, but this one?

She turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and
turns off the overhead.

If the dance Couple were on the bed and their blood was not
on the wall, the room would look exactly the way it did when
Mr. Brooks said 'hello'.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          That's better... What thrill do you
          get by killing people? Is it
          sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do
          you feel remorse? Probably that
          part of your brain doesn't exist.
          Do you have emotions of love or
          affection or joy? Or have you
          learned to fake them so you won't
          stand out in a crowd.

She's at the window now, feeling the curtains.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          What if these are stuck closed
          because you yanked them closed?
          Which means they were open when you
          came into the room.

She separates the fabric and looks out the rain-streaked
window at the four story building across the alley. There are
lights on in almost all the apartment windows.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD

          with the curtains open and the

She allows the fabric to drop back into place and turns to
look at the bed.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD

Moving slowly across a neutral colored wall.

</b>          Thank you for your time.

A door is closed. We come to the corner and are looking down
a HALLWAY at Atwood coming toward us. We move to her and
arrive just as she raises her fist to knock.

Before she can, the door opens and she and Mr. Smith who is
on his way out of his Apartment are surprised that the other
one is suddenly there. Each one takes a half step back.

Phwap! The manila envelope that was wedged under Mr. Smith's
left arm hits the floor.

                 (bends down and picks up
                  the envelope)
             ... I was about to knock. I'm

</b>                 (accepting the envelope)
             Thank you.

Through the open door, Atwood can see Mr. Smith's camera on a
table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Are you a photographer...
                 (glances at her list)

</b>             No... eh, it's kind of a hobby, I
             just started.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD

</b>             Did you happen to see anything
             unusual or suspicious that night
             around that house? Anything at all?

Mr. Smith puts on his thinking expression and pauses a little
bit before:

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             No... I wondered that when I heard
             what happened, but... no.
                 (looks at his watch)
             I'm sorry, I'm meeting someone and
             I don't want to be late.

He moves into the Hallway closing the door behind him.

          I wish I could be of more help, but
          sorry.

Watching him walk away amid the crinkle of his raincoat,
Detective Atwood, maybe because of her woman's intuition or
maybe because she's a good cop, wonders what is in that
manila envelope under his arm.

The thought is gone almost as soon as it comes and she faces
about to the next door.

<b>EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Hunched against the rain, Mr. Smith is acutely aware of the
traffic. His eyes strain to see the Occupants of each passing
car. He doesn't give a second thought to the older non-
descript Toyota parked against the far curb.

<b>INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks is in the driver's seat. Marshall is in the back.
They're both tracking the progress of Mr. Smith.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          He looks clean. He looks like he's
          alone.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          No, I'm telling you he wants to do
          this.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          I guess I should turn around and go
          pick him up.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          Nah. Just honk. Maybe he'll get
          killed crossing the street and save
          us the mess of doing it.

<b>EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Honk!! Honk!! Mr. Smith looks around. He's not sure that
sound was for him. But when the Toyota honks again and
flashes it's lights, Mr. Smith waves and splashes to the
center of the street.

Even though he stops to let it pass, a car sounds its horn
and swerves to avoid him. Mr. Smith crosses behind the Toyota
and opens the passenger door.

<b>INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT

Mr. Smith flops into the seat.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Woof! It's really coming down out
             there.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             They say it'll be sunny tomorrow.

Mr. Smith fumbles with the buttons and zipper on his
raincoat.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             I never trust those guys, when they
             say it's going to be clear it
             always rains and when they say it's
             going to rain, it's sunny.

He comes up with the manila envelope.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Here's what you asked for.

Mr. Brooks takes it and hefts it.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             The pictures and the memory card
             all here?

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Yeah.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS

             you'll feel comfortable in giving
             me all that I've asked for.

</b>             That sounds fair. Oh, I almost
             forgot. I thought you might be
             interested in this.

His hand comes forward with a card.

</b>             It's the policewoman who's looking
             for you.

Marshall snaps forward from the back seat.

</b>             Wow! We've never known anyone who's
             looking for us before.

Mr. Brooks pinches the rectangle of paper away from Mr. Smith
for a closer view.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             We've got to find out everything
             there is to know about this woman.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             This is too close, Marshall, too
             damn close.

Mr. Smith interrupts Mr. Brooks's focus on Detective Atwood's
card.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             So, what do we do now? What's the
             plan for the evening?

Mr. Brooks slips the envelope under the seat and starts the
car.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             We drive around until we see
             someone we think we might enjoy
             killing.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Really? That's it? I thought you
             might already have someone in mind.

</b>             No. This is your first time, you're
             interested. And you should be if
             you're...

A neutral-colored PICKUP swerves out of the next lane into
Mr. Brooks' lane.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Jesus Christ!!

Mr. Brooks is forced to slam on his brakes to avoid running
up the PICKUP'S tailpipe.

HOONKK!!! Mr. Brooks angrily lays on the horn.

The brake lights of the PICKUP flash in response causing Mr.
Brooks to brake again.

</b>             Oh, fuck, yes!! I've always wanted
             to kill someone who fucked with me

The PICKUP makes a right onto a side street. Mr. Brooks
follows.

</b>             Do you want to kill the driver of

Mr. Brooks begins to slow down.

Detective Atwood is on her way out the Outer Door when the
hair on the back of her neck stands on end.

Footsteps can be heard running toward her through the rain.

Her hand goes under her jacket and comes out holding a Glock
9mm.

She sidesteps out of the light into the grayness at the edge
of the doorway.

Now she sees the RUNNER. A hood hides the face. She can't
tell if it's a Man or a Woman.

Detective Atwood thumbs the Glock's safety to the 'off'
position.

The Runner passes, white breath coming from an unseen mouth.

She waits while the Figure recedes, then with the gun still
in hand she fishes into a pocket for a cell phone and heads
in the opposite direction.

A finger speedials a number. After a second ring a:

<b>                          MALE VOICE

             home in an hour and a half. I'll
             see you there.

The phone is shut, the umbrella unfurled and the darkness
swallows her up.

<b>EXT. MINI MART Ñ NIGHT

The neutral-colored Pickup is parked in front. The DRIVER
gets out.

<b>INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT
</b>
It has stopped at the curb just beyond the Entrance to the
Mini-Mart parking lot.

Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith watch the DRIVER come around the
front of another car before entering the store.

The light reveals the Driver to be a tall middle-age preppie
guy with close cropped dark hair and dark-rimmed glasses.

<b>INT. INDOOR POOL Ñ NIGHT
</b>
The lane lines are in place.

Detective Atwood is the only one in the water. Up and down
she goes with a long smooth stroke flipping the turns. She's
not swimming for pleasure, she's working out.

The underwater lights cast rippling shadows on the walls and
ceiling and since they are the only illumination, the room
feels spooky.

Atwood's fingers touch the wall. She raises her head to check
her time, then takes off her goggles.

Hanging onto the gutter she tries to catch her breath, lowers
herself under the surface, blows a lungful of bubbles, comes
up to face LARRY, a Man slightly younger than she is, in a
beautiful suit, perched on the edge of the deck looking down
at her.

He has a dress on a hangar over one shoulder and a pair of
shoes dangling from the fingers of his other hand.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Hi.

<b>                     LARRY

          from here.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Great idea.

She lifts herself to him and they kiss.

<b>INT. EXCLUSIVE SUPPER CLUB Ñ NIGHT

Detective Atwood and Larry are at a balcony table overlooking
a well-populated dance floor. The Music is 40's and 50's
performed by a live BAND.

<b>                        DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             I did something like that except I
             was the one who took the test. It
             wasn't math, a friend of mine was a
             theology major and needed a second
             language to get into the Master's

             based on?

<b>                       LARRY
</b>             Did you pass the test?

<b>                       LARRY
</b>             Don't tell me she ended up as
             Mother Teresa or the Pope.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             No, she realized very quickly there
             wasn't enough money in religion for
             her, the last I heard she'd written
             a diet book that was very
             successful.

<b>                       LARRY
</b>             She stayed in religion.

Atwood smiles, her fingers find Larry's and they intertwine.

The view floats over the balcony.

As it slowly drops, the PEOPLE on the dance floor, Couple by
Couple, disappear until there are only three Couples left,
one of them is Atwood and Larry. Her head is on his shoulder.

It's a slow dance.

Larry is very good and wherever he leads, Atwood easily
follows. The lights begin to dim and we move in.

Larry touches his lips to Atwood's neck. She arches back and
he kisses her neck again and again.

His lips move up and find hers, and we are now close on the
kiss. Gently the lips separate and we slowly retreat.

Looking into her eyes, Larry traces her lips with a finger,
then replaces that finger with his tongue.

His lips brush a cheek, down her neck to where it meets her
shoulder, his teeth close softly on the muscle, by now we are
far enough away to realize that Atwood and Larry have no
clothes on and we are:

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM Ñ NIGHT
</b>
What light there is, is coming from a room we can't see.

Larry nibbles at Atwood collarbone, kisses a breast, strokes
his hands down her sides. She shivers. He brushes his lips
back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the
flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair.

She's watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall.

Then he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her
legs. From low in her throat, Atwood moans. We lose sight of
the Couple as we move around a corner.

<b>INT. BEDROOM Ñ DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT
</b>
It's dark. Atwood is propped up against the headboard, the
sheet pulled up over her breasts.

The door to the BATHROOM opens. Larry dressed in his suit,
minus the tie, comes out, kneels on the bed and kisses her.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Thank you, this was wonderful.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD

The rain is muffled by the trees.

Move slowly toward the Building then up the side to peek
through the narrow window that circles just below the roof
line.

In the center of the room, the kiln relieves the darkness
with a yellow red glow whose rim touches a slash of white
light coming from under a door tucked in a corner.

We creep through the white light across the floor that's
littered with splashes of paint and smears of clay to the

Mr. Brooks, clad only in a T-shirt and underwear, is sitting
in front of a computer. Marshall, dressed as he usually is,
is in a chair at his side.

They are both staring at the monitor where on one side of the
screen is Detective Atwood's Police ID photo, on the other
side of the screen, Mr. Brooks is scrolling through her
personnel file.

Mr. Brooks taps a key that minimizes Atwood's file then drags
it to the right hand corner. In the middle of a key stroke it
hits him:

          political fundraiser. He owns or
          owned one of the largest insurance

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          You're such a fucking snob, Earl.
          You like her because she's rich.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          No, I like her because she found
          something that's hers. It's not the
          family business. And she's good at
          it. I'd like Jane to find something
          that's hers and that she could be
          good at.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          That's exactly why Atwood scares
          the shit out of me. She's a cop who
          doesn't need the money and she's
          looking for us. That's one fucking
          dangerous human being.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          The fact that you're not wrong
          doesn't make me admire her any
          less.

At a table the Asian Attorney is going over a brief. There
are two foamy coffees in to-go cups in front of her.
Detective Atwood arrives at the table.

<b>                    ASIAN ATTORNEY
</b>          That one's creepy to me. The doors
          are locked, the alarms are armed
          and the people are dead. It makes

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK Ñ MORNING
</b>
Atwood strides toward her car. The PEDESTRIAN traffic is
light. It's too early for the stores to be open.

Up ahead a BROWN VAN is idling at the curb, the sliding side
door is open. Atwood can see inside. Empty except for some
furniture blankets.

The Person in the Driver's seat turns to look into the back.
It's the Woman who was watching Atwood outside the Murder
House. Her hands are unseen in leather gloves.

She looks up and their eyes meet. Two strangers. The contact
is instantly broken.

Atwood takes a deep breath and smiles. After the rain, the
air is brisk and clean. It's good to be alive.

SLAM!!! Atwood is body-checked by a Man who springs out of
the recess of a doorway. His arms wrap around her, she's
lifted off her feet and the Man throws himself and her into
the Van.

<b>INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING
</b>
Oooff!! The wind is knocked out of Atwood when she lands left
shoulder first on the furniture blankets, the Man on top of
her.

The Man is Thorton Meeks, the Hangman, six feet, a solid two
hundred pounds. He's also wearing tight leather gloves.

<b>EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING
</b>
The Brown Van accelerates fast away from the curb.

<b>INT. BROWN VAN Ñ MORNING
</b>
His body crushing hers, Meeks kisses Atwood's cheek.

<b>                       MEEKS
</b>             Surprise, surprise, Tracy. I told
             you I was coming back to get you.

He frees his right hand and pulls his gun.

</b>

<b>                       MEEKS
</b>             I already know where I'm gonna hang
             you. But first I'm gonna watch
             her...
                 (indicates the Driver)
             ... have some fun with you, then
             she's gonna watch me have some fun
             with you.

He kisses her again and puts the gun to Atwood's head.

<b>                       MEEKS
</b>             Now, don't move.

He raises up and straddles her.

<b>                       MEEKS
</b>             You know the drill, I'm gonna put
             the cuffs on.

With his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back
pocket and snaps them on Atwood's right wrist.

<b>                       MEEKS
</b>             Now the left.

He rolls Atwood on her back and with the chain of the
handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left.

All Meeks' talk has allowed Atwood to catch her breath and
suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at
the top of her lungs.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b><b>             SHOOT ME!!!
</b>
At the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her
right wrist. A startled Meeks is thrown off balance. The gun
comes away from Atwood's head.

Her left arm now free, Atwood swings her palm with all of her
might into Meeks' right ear. POP!! His eardrum breaks.

Aaaggh!! He instinctually reaches to cover the damaged ear
with his gun hand.

The Driver doubles around to see what's happening. From
outside, HOONNNKK!! The Driver's attention returns to the
road.

</b><b>CONTINUED: (2)
</b>

Atwood swings again. This time she snags the barrel of the
gun and using it as a lever bends Meeks' hand back on the
wrist.

BLAM! The gun goes off. Neither one of them is hit.

At the same time Atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that Meeks
is holding in his left hand and twists into him. This
dislodges Meeks and he's off of her.

Snarling like animals they fight for the gun.

CRACK! Atwood's leverage breaks Meeks' trigger finger. His
grip loosens on the weapon. She pulls it out of his hand.

A quick push skitters it across the floor. It drops through
the open side door into the street.

Atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun. Now it's
Meeks' turn. A sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls
her motion.

He flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into
his right hand. Snap!! The blade comes out. Atwood is
reaching again for her ankle gun. She sees the flash of metal
and flings her head back.

Luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye.
Blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow.

Meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to
pull Atwood into the range of his knife.

With one foot Atwood kicks at him, with the other she pushes
off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the
Driver's hair.

Atwood's weight hinges the Driver's head back until she's
looking at the ceiling. Her scream is equal parts pain and
surprise.

<b>EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING
</b>
The Brown Van veers into the on-coming traffic. The Driver of
the car dead ahead swerves. The Van solidly clips the rear of
that car.

<b>INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING
</b>
The sudden deceleration of that impact slingshots Atwood and
Meeks forward. She hits the back of the Driver's seat.

Meeks has further to go. He loses his hold on the handcuffs
and smashes into the passenger seat.

Her right hand now free, Atwood scratches for the gun on her
hip.

<b>EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING
</b>
Careening across its lane, the Van sideswipes a parked car.

<b>INT. BROWN VAN Ñ MORNING
</b>
That impact rips Atwood's hand out of the Driver's hair and
sends her sliding on her knees toward the side door.

On her way she unclips her gun and is bringing it out of her
holster when Meeks who has managed to hang onto the passenger
seat sees this and slams a foot into her chest.

Atwood is launched backward out the side door.

<b>EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING
</b>
In slow motion Atwood flies through the air while at normal
speed the Van is leaving her behind.

SMASH! Butt first, Atwood hammers into the back window of a
parked car. The shattering glass breaks her fall.

Groggily she rolls out of the indentation. Gun still in hand
and blood covering one side of her face she slides off the
car to stand in the street.

The Van is nowhere in sight.

<b>INT. EMERGENCY ROOM Ñ DAY
</b>
Captain Lister is watching a DOCTOR sew up the gash on
Detective Atwood's forehead.

             escaped. No contact that way so far

<b>EXT. DRUG STORE PARKING LOT Ñ NIGHT
</b>
In the scattering of vehicles Mr. Brooks' Toyota is hidden in
plain sight in a row of cars.

<b>INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Behind the wheel, Mr. Brooks is again wearing his Pottery-
Throwing clothes. Mr. Smith is in the passenger seat and
Marshall is leaning forward from the back.

They're all focused to varying degrees on the Entrance to the
store. Mr. Smith raises his watch for a look at the time.

Mr. Smith looks.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Uh huh.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             This is not the kind of guy who
             leaves his pickup in an unguarded
             Lot overnight.

The silence returns.

All three Men idly observe an old green Pontiac convertible
with a frayed top and paint peeling, come into the Lot and
park two spaces away facing them. We saw this car last
watching Atwood from outside the Murder House.

The headlights go off.

The Driver's door opens. The Woman who was with Meeks in the
Van steps out and hurries toward the Drug Store.

She of course means nothing to Mr. Brooks but in the brief
seconds the domelight is on, he catches sight of the Man in
the passenger seat. A memory tickles his brain.

He turns to Marshall.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          Remember that cop you like, Atwood,
          who's chasing us, she's the one who
          put him away. I think his name is
          Thorton Meeks.

Mr. Brooks cocks his head at the vague outline of Meeks.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Well, well, well... What would life
          be without surprises?

Mr. Smith who, remember, cannot hear or see Marshall,
straightens up.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          There he is!

The Man they are waiting for is coming down the steps of the
store. On the way to his Pickup he takes off a Manager's
smock.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          You know what's weird? I'll bet he
          has all these plans of what he's
          going to do tonight and tomorrow
          and he doesn't know he will already
          be dead and won't be able to do any
          of them.

Mr. Brooks nods absently. The Drug Store Manager arrives at
his truck.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          I don't think I want to kill this

</b>              (to Mr. Smith)
          I know I said we would, but I don't
          think it would be that much fun.

Mr. Brooks starts the car and puts it in reverse.

</b>          So just like that, you're saying
          'no', it's not going to happen.

</b>          I know you're upset, Mr. Smith, and
          I'm sorry.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          Yeah, I am upset.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Maybe I was a little abrupt back
          there, but let me explain. Finding
          someone you think would be fun to
          kill is a bit like falling in love.
          You meet a lot of candidates, and
          you like some of them and they're
          nice, but they're not right; and
          then that special one shows up and
          your heart beats faster and you
          know that's the one. The man in the
          pickup did not make my heart beat
          faster.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          Okay, he did not make your heart
          beat faster. If not him, who?

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          I don't know, I think I have
          someone in mind.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          Do you need me to do any work on
          it?

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          No, let's see how it plays out.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          You see? That's my problem. That
          makes me feel like I'm being jerked
          around, Mr. Brooks. I thought it
          was happening last night, then it
          was happening tonight. And now it's
          "Let's see how it plays out".

<b>                       MR. SMITH

He gets out and with the door still open, turns back.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             I want to do this. But if it drags
             on too long, I could change my

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Maybe you don't anymore.

He shuts the door. Marshall and Mr. Brooks watch him walk
away.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             Even if that guy was charming and
             funny I still wouldn't like him.

Mr. Brooks vacuums the passenger seat and dash and floor and
everything around it.

Mr. Brooks removes his shoes and leaves them on the plastic,
then slips his feet into paper slippers.

With handiwipes he wipes down the outside of the passenger
door, in fact anything on that side Mr. Smith could have
touched.

He opens the door and wipes down the seat and the dash and
the console.

Back on the plastic, Mr. Brooks undresses. On top of his
clothes he drops the used handiwipes, the slippers and the
vacuum bag.

The corners of the plastic sheet are folded up, twisted
together and Zip-tied to create a nice neat package which Mr.
Brooks picks up and takes into the Ceramics Studio.

Jane is on a couch flanked by her Mother and a LAWYER.
Standing behind them is a heavyset LAWYER and a YOUNG LAWYER.
We've never seen any of these Men before.

Facing this Group from the opposite couch are the two
Detectives. There are two tape recorders on the coffee table.

Mr. Brooks is in a chair off to one side watching everything.

For him the conversation is merely a burble of voices. He
studies his daughter while she answers a question.

She is unaware of his scrutiny. And finally all he can see
are her lips moving. Even the burble has faded to silence.

             really didn't know the guy that
             well. It happened at about the same
             time I found out I was pregnant,

<b>INT. KITCHEN Ñ BROOKS HOUSE - DAY
</b>
With a shaky hand, Mr. Brooks raises the glass to his lips.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          God help me. What do I do?

Sitting on the island behind him Marshall waits for Mr.
Brooks to gulp the glass dry.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          She did it, didn't she?

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Yeah. It'll take the Cops a week to
          ten days to put their case together
          and then they'll come back and
          arrest her.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          What are you going to do?

Mr. Brooks puts his hands over his eyes and sobs, then wiping
away the tears:

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          I've been afraid of this since the
          day she was born. She has what I
          have.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          Yes, she does. But you've always
          been smart about it. She was
          stupid. She did it because she got
          off on it, she did it for fun. Why
          didn't she think it through? A
          hatchet! And she left it there!!

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          They were pretty graphic, weren't
          they?

<b>                    MARSHALL

          mistake.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             What does she think I think?
             Doesn't she remember what she told
             me? That the BMW was being driven
             across country by a friend and now
             right in front of me, she tells the
             Cops it was stolen.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             You've always cleaned up after her,
             whatever she did, all her life.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             If the BMW has anything
             incriminating in it, I hope it was
             stolen or she dropped it at the
             bottom of a very deep lake.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             Do you think she knows what kind of
             trouble she's in?

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             I think she thought she had gotten
             away with it until the Cops showed
             up. I should have listened to her,
             it was there. She was telling me.
             'I didn't quit school because I was
             pregnant'. I should have dug
             deeper.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             And where would you be but at the
             exact same place you are now. It is
             not your fault, Earl. Part of your
             problem with her is that you always
             think it is.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             She has what I have, Marshall. So
             on a very basic level, it is my
             fault.

<b>                       MARSHALL
</b>             What are you going to do?

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Maybe the best thing for her would
             be to let her go to jail.

</b>          You might be right, Earl, you might
          be. Because you know if she's not
          stopped, she's going to do it
          again. And if she wants to take
          over the box business, the next
          victim could be you.

<b>INT. CRIME LAB Ñ DAY

A slide of what looks like enlarged grains of sand among
giant carpet fibers is projected onto a screen.

The Lead Crime Lab Technician:

<b>                    SIGY (O.S.)
</b>          We found traces of this in two
          places.

The slide changes to an overhead schematic showing the
interior of the house where the dance Couple was murdered.

Detective Atwood and Detective Snyder are standing with Sigy
watching the presentation. Atwood has a bandage covering the
stitches over her eye.

             was tracked it into the house and
             it stuck to the carpet fibers.
             We're thinking it was the killer.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             It could have been tracked in by a
             friend.

<b>                       SIGY
</b>             That's the thing, you see, the
             friend would have had to have been
             there almost at the same time the
             killer was. Otherwise the samples
             would have been dry and the killer
             would have vacuumed them up.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Is the clay rare, is it difficult
             to get?

<b>                       SIGY

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             No, Sigy, it doesn't. It does give

The door closes behind her.

<b>INT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ DAY
</b>
With a hidden lever, Mr. Brooks lowers casters under the kiln
and rolls it aside to reveal a Combination Safe imbedded in
the concrete floor.

He spins the dial, opens the Safe and extracts four quadruple-
pocketed plastic sleeves which he lines up in front of
himself.

Each sleeve contains a Driver's License, two Credit cards and
cash.

The pictures on the Driver's Licenses are of Mr. Brooks, but
you wouldn't immediately recognize him because of the
disguises.

As he's trying to decide which of the four Identities would
be best for what he has in mind, Marshall comes forward to
look over his shoulder.

<b>                    MARSHALL

          things, is what does Mr. Smith do
          when he's walking west tonight and
          you don't show up. That little
          freak could flip out.

Mr. Brooks chooses the first sleeve and the third sleeve. The
other two go back into the Safe.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          I'll take care of it on the way to

Mr. Smith exits one of the doors and continues on into the
Parking Lot to a moderately expensive foreign car sitting in
a space identified by a sign which reads:

Mr. Baffert.

He squeezes the 'disarm' button on his key chain. The car
chirps twice and he opens the door. Bending his knees to get
in, he stops.

There is a section of Newspaper wedged in the steering wheel.

When his brain unlocks he straightens up and moving only the
top of his body, makes a quick recon of the surrounding area
and his back seat.

Nothing threatening seen, he eases into the seat. Slam! The
door is closed and locked.

<b>INT. CAR Ñ DAY

Gingerly, Mr. Smith removes the Newspaper. It folds open. On
the first page there are words circled in red.

As his eyes dart from one to the other we go in close on the
words and hear Mr. Brooks say them as Mr. Smith finds them.

passenger seat.

Atwood steps back as Mr. Smith gets out. Behind her,
Detective Snyder is standing next to the Driver's door of an
un-marked Police car which has blocked Mr. Smith in.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Really? Because I was driving
             around and I got this sudden
             feeling that you had something to
             tell me about the murders.

<b>                       MR. SMITH

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             That's disappointing. Because when
             I left you the last time we talked,
             I felt I had missed a clue that was
             right in front of me that would
             solve this whole case.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Are you positive? Because we found
             potter's clay on the carpet of the
             murder house and I was sure you
             said to me that you worked with
             clay, that you made pots.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             No. I said my hobby was
             photography, not pottery.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Maybe that was it. The Stewardess
             upstairs said the victims kept
             their curtains open when they made
             love. Could I see some of the
             pictures you took of that Couple?

Mr. Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood. His Adam's
apple moves up and down though he makes no sound. Should he
or shouldn't he?

Finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn
of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at
the passenger seat of his car.

Part of it is draped over the console. The red circles around
the words on that page jump out at him.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS (V.O.)

Mr. Smith returns his attention to Detective Atwood.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             You are harassing me, Detective
             Atwood. You know very well I'm not
             a potter and I don't have any
             pictures! So my feeling is that
             your feeling is wrong and that you
             should move your car and let me go

In his Pottery-Throwing clothes, Mr. Brooks is behind the

There's an Ace Hardware Store bag sitting upright and open on
the passenger seat. We peek over the edge of the bag.

A brand new hatchet with a gleaming blade sits at the bottom.

Mr. Brooks adjusts the rearview mirror. Marshall is on the
passenger side of the back seat.

The Alamo Rental car carrying Mr. Brooks continues on.

<b>INT. HIGH CEILING BUNGALOW Ñ NIGHT
</b>
It's dark. There's barely enough ambient light to see that we
are close on the knob of the Front Door.

From outside we hear the muffled sound of a Black & Decker
cordless drill and the knob begins to vibrate. Someone is
drilling the lock.

The sound stops. The knob turns. The door opens. A flashlight
is shone into our face.

<b>                       UNIFORMED POLICEMAN (O.S.)
</b>             Mr. Alvin Griffin, this is the

<b>EXT. HIGH CEILING BUNGALOW Ñ NIGHT
</b>
From the protection of the doorjamb, a very young UNIFORMED
POLICEMAN is the person shining the flashlight into the
house.

He's flanked on either side of the door by Detective Atwood
and Detective Snyder.

The Officer's flashlight illuminates a short ENTRYWAY with a
HALL immediately off to the left and the LIVING ROOM fading
into darkness, straight ahead.

<b>                       UNIFORMED POLICEMAN

Flashlight in her left hand and the Glock in her right,
Detective Atwood is the first one across the threshold.

She directs the beam at the wall next to the door; finds the
light switch. Click! Click! Click.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Lights don't work.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

She continues to the Hall. The darkness is so oppressive
there, it seems that her stream of light must struggle to
pierce it.

The Room at the end is the KITCHEN.

With Snyder hanging in the Entryway to protect her back,
Atwood eases the hand with the flashlight around the corner.

The dishwasher, the sink, the cabinets gleam dully back at
her. She steps inside.

A debris field of empty pharmaceutical boxes and vials trails
away from the Refrigerator.

Her flashlight sweeps the rest of the Room. Beyond an open
countertop in the DINING AREA, the light blurs past an oval
of white, and then comes back.

It's the face of a WOMAN!!

Careful of the litter, Atwood moves forward until she can see
that the Woman is sitting in a chair at the far end of the
dining table.

Her throat has been cut. Her head is being held upright by
her hair which is taped to the back of the chair.

She has a pen taped between her fingers, but the Appointment
Book in front of her is drenched in blood.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD

             We have a dead woman in here.

A light and footsteps hurry toward her from the LIVING ROOM.
Atwood swings her light at them.

<b>                       SNYDER
</b>             Hey!

He squints and turns away.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             I thought you were behind me.

<b>                       SNYDER

Atwood swings her light back onto the dead Woman. The
combined illumination of the flashlights cause the support
joists twelve feet up to throw eerie shadows onto the open
ceiling.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Snyder, meet Mona.

The Uniformed Policeman comes up beside Atwood.

<b>                    UNIFORMED POLICEMAN
</b>          I called it in.

The smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much
for him. His gorge rises and he gags.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Do that outside.

The Officer doesn't have to be told twice.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>              (to Snyder, re: the body)
          Meeks did this.

<b>                    SNYDER
</b>          I thought Meeks hung people.

Atwood retraces her steps in the Kitchen.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Meeks is a steroid freak. This
          Refrigerator was always full of
          steroids. Mona was Alvin Griffin's
          niece, receptionist, lover and
          keeper of the keys.

She focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a
steel band that runs around the Refrigerator. With the barrel
of the Glock she opens the door.

The only edibles inside are a tomato, half a loaf of bread, a
package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a KFC box.
The rest of the space is vacant.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Well, the steroids are certainly
          gone.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD

She shuts the Refrigerator.

<b>                     DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Let's go see what's in the rest of
          the house.

</b>
Atwood and her flashlight pass us. Three feet to her right
and slightly behind is Snyder and his flashlight.

The two Detectives are leaving the Living Room and entering
the HALL toward the bedrooms. The ceiling is low here and it
feels very claustrophobic.

Ahead is a Door painted red.

But before they get to it, there's a Room on the right.
Snyder shines his light in.

It's a BATHROOM. The shower curtain is open. Nobody in the
tub.

The Door ahead is waiting, but there's another Door on the
right. Snyder shines his light in.

This one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves
of oils and unguents.

They've come to the red Door. Atwood will open this one.

She turns the knob and pushes. The Door is stuck. She and
Snyder exchange a look.

Snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against
the wall. He shuts off his flashlight.

Atwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the
door and pushes.

There's a sudden Snap! Then the door swings freely open. The
beam of Atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a
bed, a dresser, a...

CREEEKKK!!! The sound is coming from up in the rafters.
Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction.

For an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape
falling fast right at her.

</b><b>CONTINUED: (4)
</b>

Then it's lost in the darkness and then picked up again in
the reflected light in the Hall. The shape is a naked Man.

WHACK!! The Man nails Atwood in the shoulder. BANG! Her gun
goes off. She bounces into the wall and onto her ass.

Barely slowed the Man continues in an upward arc. His feet
and knees slam into the ceiling. Plaster dust rains.

The Man swings back, past Snyder. He's lost in the darkness
again. Then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop
just inside the bedroom Door.

The Man is hanging from a rope around his neck. He's dead.
His Body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare
flesh.

In fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the Man's
chest. Printed on the paper in big black letters are the
words:

<b>HA! HA! HA! HA!

</b>          Dirty.

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          That's understandable. You've never
          killed for this reason before. The
          feeling will go away.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          I don't think so. It's the whole
          thing, Marshall. If I could find a
          way to just disappear, where there
          was absolutely no trace of me;
          because eventually I will get
          caught doing this. And it'll be
          very embarrassing for me and Emma
          and Jane. So I've been thinking...
          is there a way that Mr. Smith could

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          Number one, Mr. Smith is not smart
          enough to do that. Number two,
          there is no reason, if you're

          get caught.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS

<b>                    MARSHALL
</b>          I'm not particularly fond of that
          plan, Earl. Remember if you die, I

There, as a first car in a double space is the old green

Reflected in the glass of an open mirrored closet door is a
tastefully furnished DEN with floor-to-ceiling windows that
look out at LAKE MICHIGAN from the 20th floor.

An empty suitcase falls into this picture and bounces on the
carpet. Behind the mirrored door, Detective Atwood is atop a
stepstool rummaging through the suitcases on the highest
shelf.

Throughout the Condo there is an incessant ringing of the
phones.

Another suitcase goes down and Atwood finds what she's
looking for - a framed color 8 x 10 photo of her husband,
Jesse. He's in a business suit and holding some kind of
trophy.

The phones stop ringing.

Atwood comes down the stepstool, folds it and is carrying it
back to where it lives when the phones start ringing again.

She picks up a cordless in the Den.

She slams the frame of Jesse's photo against the inside of a
metal trash can.

Nancy winces and then smiles at the sound of shattering
glass.

Atwood plucks the photo out of the frame and tears it so that
the rip can be heard over the phone.

<b>INT. KITCHEN Ñ BROOKS HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
In his slippers and robe, Mr. Brooks is standing in the
Doorway watching Jane who is leaning over the Counter with an
open Newspaper next to a bowl of cereal.

He has a chance to take a good long look before she feels his
presence and raises her head.

<b>                       JANE
</b>             Oh, Hi, Daddy, I thought you'd
             already be gone.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Roger called. There was another
             murder last night near Stanford.

<b>                       JANE
</b>             Oh...

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Done the same way as the one they
             talked to you about. Right down to
             the hatchet being left at the
             scene.

Jane can't quite conceal the tremor of surprise that ripples
through her and Mr. Brooks sees it.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             They think they have a serial
             killer. Obviously you were here
             last night, so you're in the clear.

<b>                       JANE
</b>             That's good news, isn't it? I mean
             even if you're innocent it's good
             news to know you're not a suspect.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Oh, yeah. How's the morning
             sickness? Do you want to ride in
             with me today?

<b>                       JANE
</b>             I feel fine, but I don't know how
             long that will last.

Mr. Brooks nods, turns to leave, then turns back.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Look where? Please tell me.
             Everyone knows who Meeks is and is
             looking for him. The chiropractor
             was the last link to his old life
             that I know of. The only way we'll
             find him, now, is if someone turns
             him in or we trip over him at a bus
             stop. On the other hand, Detective
             Snyder, no one knows who the
             Thumbprint Killer is or where he
             is. However, I have a fucking hunch
             this guy Baffert does. I have two
             days to play that hunch. If you
             feel like you're wasting your time

Atwood and Snyder watch Mr. Smith enter the Restaurant. They

She twists the screen around so she can read the message.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             No. She would have said that.

Snyder points across the street at Mr. Smith coming out of
the Restaurant carrying a Take-Out bag.

<b>                       SNYDER

She starts the car. There's the muted 'tone' again. Atwood
looks at the computer screen.

</b>             This is my case, what you're doing

It's deserted with only a small spill of light coming from
Mr. Brooks' Office.

Mr. Brooks is at his desk.

The lamp at his elbow throws a yellow cone across his face.
His head is in his hands, he's been crying.

Marshall steps out of the shadows behind him.

<b>                       MARSHALL

<b>                       MR. BROOKS

He reaches into a bottom drawer and as he takes out an
envelope, Marshall reads the tear-stained hand written letter
resting on the blotter.

<b>                       MARSHALL

<b>EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT
</b>
On the sidewalk Mr. Smith is walking toward the on-coming
traffic. The headlights make it difficult to tell one car
from the other until they pass. That doesn't keep him from
looking for Mr. Brooks.

The houses stop and he's passing a pocket park. In a dark
space between the street lamps, a hand falls on Mr. Smith's
shoulder. He jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat.
It's Mr. Brooks, in his Pottery-Throwing clothes.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS

Mr. Smith swallows hard and nods. Mr. Brooks propels him into
the park.

             didn't see the killer or anything
             like that, but since it was weird I
             thought I should call.

She's about to hang up when Struber speaks again.

Atwood disconnects then quickly dials.

<b>                     DETECTIVE ATWOOD

          apartment with a Search Warrant...

<b>INT. APARTMENT BUILDING Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Coming up the back STAIRS we arrive at a LANDING and make a
right. In front of us is Mr. Smith watching Mr. Brooks pick
the deadbolt in the Service door.

<b>CLICK!
</b>
Mr. Brooks straightens up, twists the handle and pushes the
door inward. It's caught by a chain. He takes the bent rubber-
tipped forceps from one pocket, from another he hands Mr.
Smith a pair of latex gloves.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Put these on.

<b>INT. APARTMENT Ñ NIGHT
</b>
In the middle of the large darkened KITCHEN, Mr. Brooks
pauses to listen to the sounds of the Apartment.

The gun with the silencer is already in his right hand. Both
are encased in a Ziplock bag.

Beside him, Mr. Smith is wide eyed with fear and
anticipation. His teeth are even chattering.

<b>                     MR. BROOKS
</b>          Try a couple deep breaths through
          your nose.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             This won't take long.

Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith come out of the Kitchen. The LIVING
ROOM is quite well appointed. There's a fire going in the
Fireplace.

The sound of a T.V. is coming from a ROOM off a HALL up
ahead. That is where Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith are headed.

They're more than half way across the LIVING ROOM when DING!
DONG!, the doorbell rings.

Mr. Smith gasps and looks beseechingly at Mr. Brooks. Without
an ounce of hurry, Mr. Brooks maneuvers him back into the
shadows of the KITCHEN.

The doorbell rings again.

A wet spot appears in Mr. Smith's crotch and runs down his
pant leg. Pee drips onto the linoleum.

A Man comes out of the Hallway. The Living Room light goes
on.

The Man is Jesse, Detective Atwood's estranged husband.

He opens the Front Door.

The Woman who comes in is Sheila, his divorce lawyer.

They kiss, tongues. His hands brush over her breasts. He
begins to unbutton her blouse. The kiss breaks. As he
continues unbuttoning.

<b>                       SHEILA
</b>             I called your wife's lawyer.
             They're thinking about the five
             million dollars.

Jesse opens the blouse and looks at the breasts under the
bra.

<b>                       JESSE
</b>             Realistically how much do you think
             we can get?

Sheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the LIVING
ROOM where she drops her briefcase on the couch.

<b>                     SHEILA
</b>          If we go to court, best case, two,
          if she wants to settle, best case,
          three, but I would be happy with
          two seven.

Backlit by the Fireplace, Jesse kisses her again.

From the KITCHEN, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith watch Jesse unzip
Sheila's slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her
legs.

She steps out of them. He kisses the inside of her thighs,
her crotch, then standing up:

<b>                    JESSE
</b>          I'll be right back.

On his way out of the LIVING ROOM:

<b>                    JESSE
</b>          I think we should hold firm for
          three.

He shuts off the light. In the glow of the Fireplace, Sheila
removes her jacket.

<b>                    SHEILA
</b>          Let's not be piggish, two five, two
          seven, would be a good deal.

The T.V. goes silent. Jesse returns with a partially full
glass of Champagne.

He hands Sheila a glass from a side table, takes a bottle out
of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass:

<b>                    SHEILA
</b>              (teasing)
          You've already had half a bottle.

<b>                    JESSE
</b>          You're late; if we want it, there's
          more.

They clink glasses.

<b>                      SHEILA
</b>          To us.

<b>                    JESSE

<b>                    SHEILA
</b>              (after a sip)
          We have to do this fast because
          remember, Marie is meeting us here.

<b>                    JESSE
</b>          We could ask her to join us.

<b>                       SHEILA
</b>          Not funny.

<b>                    JESSE
</b>              (undoing the front of her
               bra)
          I wasn't trying to be.

She bops him playfully. He bends and slips a nipple into his
mouth. Sheila bites her lip and moans.

In the KITCHEN, Mr. Smith shifts around for a better view.
The floor under him CRREEEKKS!

In the LIVING ROOM, both Sheila and Jesse react to the sound.

<b>                    SHEILA
</b>          Are we alone?

<b>                       JESSE
</b>          Yeah.

Mr. Brooks seems to appear magically out of the darkened
Kitchen with his gun raised. He's followed by Mr. Smith.
Sheila opens her mouth to scream.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Don't do that.

<b>INT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT BUILDING Ñ NIGHT

Detective Atwood hurries down the HALL and out of breath,
stops in front of Mr. Smith's door. She raps sharply. Waits a
bare three seconds and raps again.

<b>                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>          Mr. Baffert?... Mr. Baffert?

The door of the Apartment behind her opens and an OLDER WOMAN
sticks her head out.

<b>                       OLDER WOMAN
</b>          He's gone.

Atwood shows her badge.

<b>                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Do you have any idea when he'll be
             back?

<b>                       OLDER WOMAN
</b>             He skipped out. I heard him leave
             this evening and a few minutes
             later there were Movers here. Musta
             been behind on the rent. He didn't
             even say good-bye.

<b>                          DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Thank you.

As the Old Lady watches, Atwood tries the knob. It's
unlocked. She pushes the door open.

The HALLWAY and LIVING ROOM she can see are completely empty.
Furniture, T.V., camera equipment, art, gone.

<b>                       OLDER WOMAN
</b>             I told you.

<b>INT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT Ñ NIGHT

On her way in, Atwood draws her gun.

Keeping close to the walls she audits the KITCHEN. All the
Cabinet doors are open. Dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, gone.

She moves on to the BATHROOM. Soap, shampoo, toilet paper,
toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, washcloths, the contents of
the Medicine Cabinet, gone.

She moves on to the BEDROOM. Bed, night table, lamps, T.V.,
computer, gone. Clothes closets, empty of everything.

She looks around. Mr. Smith's entire Apartment has been
stripped absolutely clean, except...

... there's a crumpled piece of paper in the far corner of
the Bedroom.

Atwood goes over and gets down on one knee. With her fingers
pulling at the corners she is able to straighten the paper
enough to make out that it's a work order from a Moving
company.

Reading it with the paper pinched between thumb and
forefinger of her left hand, Atwood rises. There's the
silhouette of a Man in the doorway behind her.

<b>                       MAN
</b>             Obviously Baffert's gone...

Atwood whirls, gun up. She sees that it's Snyder.

             order and...
                 (points))
             ... it looks like this is the
             address where they're taking
             Baffert's stuff.

<b>                       SNYDER

in stunned silence.

Without taking his eyes off the road.

Mr. Smith slides a pistol from under his jacket and points it
at Mr. Brooks.

             DNA at the scene of a double
             homicide, and there's nothing to
             indicate that I was ever there. If

             No. I still have pictures of you
             doing the first murder.

Mr. Brooks smiles a knowing smile. Beyond him on the other
side of the Divider, cars are zipping by in the opposite
direction.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Yes. But what were you doing at the
             second murder?

Mr. Smith doesn't have an answer for that.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Let me help you with a thought. You
             say I forced you to come along and
             if I'm not here or more
             specifically my body is not here to
             say different, you might have a
             chance to beat the rap. Now you're
             probably asking yourself why I
             would help you. I'm tired, Mr.
             Smith, I'm tired of killing. But
             I'm an addict, I can't quit. I've
             tried. I can't do it on my own. So
             I'll let you kill me but I want you
             to do it smart, in a way that I
             disappear and my family never knows
             what I was.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          How do I do that?

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          There's a cemetery I know about. We
          find an open grave, you shoot me, I
          fall in the grave, you shovel in
          just enough earth to cover me,
          tomorrow a casket is lowered onto
          me and I've disappeared. It's a
          good plan. What do you say?...

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          Why should I trust you?

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          You don't have to trust me. You're
          the man holding the gun, you saw me
          put mine in the trunk.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          I don't know. You really want me to
          kill you?

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Yes.

<b>                    MR. SMITH
</b>          Okay... But any sudden moves and
          you're dead on the spot and I'll
          make sure your family knows what
          you are.

Atwood crosses to the elevator. She pushes the call button.
With an arthritic rattle the door opens.

<b>INT. ELEVATOR Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Atwood selects the 5th Floor. Creek!, Clatter!, Clank!, the
door closes and after a stuttering liftoff the car begins its
ascent. The overhead light flickers on and off. Atwood looks
up at it.

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks leads Mr. Smith across a street to a pedestrian
gate set in a high wall.

Through the bars of the gate we can see a Cemetery bathed in
moonlight.

Mr. Brooks reaches into his pocket. Mr. Smith tightens his
grip on the gun.

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Uh uh, take your hand out real
             slow.

Mr. Brooks does as he's told. A key dangles from his fingers.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             It's locked. You don't want to

<b>                       MR. SMITH
</b>             Why do you own a cemetery?

Mr. Brooks unlocks the gate and preceding Mr. Smith, goes
inside.

</b>             You always want to invest in things

He locks the gate and handing the key to Mr. Smith:

             around here somewhere. Let's see if
             we can find it.

He produces a small flashlight from his pocket and off they
go.

<b>INT. OLD DECO BUILDING Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Repeating their arthritic performance the elevator doors
open. Atwood steps out into a wide sporadically lit HALLWAY.

Peering at the numbers Atwood goes to her Left.

In the middle of the Hall behind her a Couple exits a Room
and drifts to the other side of the Hall on their way to the
elevator.

Atwood re-checks the number on the Moving Company's Work
Order - 517, she's going the wrong way. She turns around.

Now Atwood and the Couple are walking toward each other on
opposite sides of the Hall.

Atwood steps into an area of light.

The reflection off her face catches the attention of the Man
who is wearing a wide brimmed hat. He lifts his head.

It's Thorton Meeks. The Woman with him was the Driver of the
Van. She's wearing a watchcap.

Meeks gently takes his Companion's arm. They stop. Her eyes
go to where he's looking and then back to his. At some
unspoken signal they both draw their guns.

Intent on finding 517 and Baffert, the Couple hasn't
registered on Atwood's radar.

BANG! TWOCK! A chunk of plaster blows off the wall next to
her head. Startled, Atwood winces away. BANG! The Woman
fires. The slug explodes the plaster on the other side of
Atwood's head.

Now Atwood is turning toward them, gun in hand.

Meeks fires. The bullet passes through Atwood's jacket.

</b>

Instinctively Atwood assumes a classic duelist's pose
offering the smallest target possible. Calmly she squeezes
off her first shot.

The plaster explodes from the wall above Meeks' head. The
Woman fires.

A hole appears in Atwood's sleeve. Atwood pulls the trigger
again.

SMACK! The Woman screams and falls back into Meeks, a bullet
in her hip. Atwood's third shot takes the hat off Meeks head.
She now realizes who her attackers are.

<b>                        DETECTIVE ATWOOD
</b>             Meeks?!!

Dragging the Woman in the direction of the stairs, BANG!
Meeks fires. Maybe it's his broken trigger finger that
affects his aim. The shots miss. BANG! BANG! The Woman fires.

Atwood's next two shots miss.

Meeks and the Woman arrive at the stairs and before rounding
the corner, BANG! BANG! BANG!, fire at Atwood who is now
moving deliberately at them.

Atwood doesn't try and dodge the bullets or flinch away from
them and her shots are unhurried.

The next one catches the Woman in the side. The one after
that nails Meeks in the left shoulder. He's spun into the
Woman.

<b>INT. STAIRS - OLD DECO BUILDING Ñ NIGHT

Leaning on each other Meeks and the Woman lurch down the worn
marble steps.

</b>
Atwood reaches the stairs and cheats a look around the
corner. BANG! BANG! BANG! From the landing below, Meeks and
the Woman fire.

Atwood steps out from behind the wall and shoulders square,
shoots. Another sidestep. This shot shatters Meeks' knee. He
bellows in pain.

Moving to the side again, Atwood shoots. But Meeks' knee has
collapsed and he and the Woman are already tumbling down the
next set of steps. Atwood waits. There's silence, then the
murmur of voices.

<b>                       MEEKS
</b>                 (calls out)
             Atwood?

<b>INT. STAIRS - OLD DECO BUILDING Ñ NIGHT

Gun at the ready, Atwood edges her way downward. At about the
tenth step she is able to lean over and look through the
banisters.

Meeks and the Woman are propping themselves up against the
wall on the LANDING below. Both of them still have their
guns.

The moment Meeks' eyes meet Atwood's, he puts his gun to the
Woman heads. BANG!

Atwood sucks in her breath.

Meeks puts the gun to his temple. BANG!

Atwood clasps a hand to her mouth and exhales in ragged
gulps.

The finger of light from Mr. Brooks' handtorch discovers a
freshly dug GRAVE.

</b>             There we are. Now if I stand
             here...

He positions himself at one end of the Grave.

</b>             ... and you stand there, not too
             far away and you shoot me, I should

Mr. Brooks shuts off his light and straightens up.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             Okay, let's get this over with.

Mr. Smith raises his gun and points it at Mr. Brooks's head.
He hesitates.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             I'll close my eyes.

He does. Mr. Smith pulls the trigger.

Click!

Mr. Smith looks in horror at the malfunctioning gun. Mr.
Brooks opens his eyes. Mr. Smith aims the gun again.

Click!... Click!

<b>                          MR. BROOKS
</b>             I'm sorry.

As he talks he counters around until Mr. Smith is the one
with his back to the open Grave.

<b>                       MR. BROOKS
</b>             I really did want you to kill me.
             But in case at the last minute I
             changed my mind, I returned to your
             apartment and bent the firing pin
             on your gun.

He wrenches the shovel out of a mound of waiting earth. Mr.
Smith tries to fire the gun at Mr. Brooks again.

<b>CLICK!... CLICK!
</b>
<b>                       MR. BROOKS

          story.

</b>          The contents of your safety deposit
          box, Mr. Smith, have vanished.

Without warning, Mr. Brooks swings the shovel. The force of
the blow breaks Mr. Smith's left arm. He howls.

The next blow comes almost immediately. It smashes into the
left side of Mr. Smith's head.

The screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes Mr.
Smith to stand up straight and wobbling, look directly at Mr.
Brooks.

The blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight.

Mr. Brooks takes a step to the side, cocks his wrists and
swings again. His full weight is behind this one.

The blade of the shovel strikes Mr. Smith in the throat very
nearly taking off his head. The flesh that was once Mr. Smith
falls to the ground.

Mr. Brooks takes a shovel of dirt from the pile and whistling
'By The Light Of The Silvery Moon', begins the task of
covering Mr. Smith.

<b>INT. COFFEE SHOP Ñ MORNING

A Newspaper is lying unfolded on the Counter next to the
remnants of a breakfast.

The headline reads - NATIONWIDE MANHUNT FOR THUMBPRINT KILLER
- Under that headline is a large picture of Mr. Smith aka Mr.
Baffert.

In the lower right corner is another headline to a story -
Murder Suicide For The Hangman -.

The reader of the paper is Mr. Brooks. On a stool next to
him, Marshall is also reading.

<b>                    MARSHALL

          meetings and I'll control it.

On the other stool next to Mr. Brooks is a WOMAN. Her large
purse hangs open from the back of the stool; the cel phone
clearly visible inside. Mr. Brooks looks at the phone.

We follow the phone down, down, down, until it hits the
pavement and disintegrates.

<b>EXT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Everything is as it was.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - BROOKS HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
</b>
It's dark. In his robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks is standing in
front of the open refrigerator gazing blankly at the contents
with a glass of milk in one hand. There's nothing he wants in
here. He closes the door.

<b>INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY Ñ BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Carrying the glass of milk, Mr. Brooks passes Jane's ROOM.
The door is ajar. He stops, backs up and looks. His
Daughter's asleep.

<b>INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - BROOKS HOUSE Ñ NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks walks to the bed and leans over to give her a kiss
on the cheek.

His lips have just brushed her flesh when she twists
violently under him and stabs upward with a pair of scissors.
The blades are driven deep into his throat. Mr. Brooks jerks
back, the milk flies out of his hand.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>          Agghhh!!! Agghhh!!!

He grabs at the handle of the scissors, but his blood makes
them too slippery. He can't pull them out.

<b>                    EMMA (V.O.)
</b>          Honey, Earl, Earl...

<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM Ñ BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Brooks is tossing in his sleep next to Emma. She has a
hold of his arm.

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          Wake up, wake up...

On the pillow Mr. Brooks' eyes fly open.

<b>                    EMMA
</b>          You were having a nightmare.

<b>                    MR. BROOKS
</b>              (breathing hard)
          Oh... I woke you up.

<b>                       EMMA
</b>          It's okay.

She kisses him on the forehead.

<b>                    EMMA (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm here, go back to sleep, I'm
          here.

Taking his hand, she lies back down. After a moment Mr.
Brooks turns over on his side and looks directly at us. His
lips begin to move but we can't hear what he's saying, so we
move in on his face. It's not until it fills our view that we
can hear the words.
