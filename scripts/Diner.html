          FENWICK walks along the dimly lit basement. Heavy wiatei
          coats hang from hooks on the wall. In the b.g., there
          is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the
          rest rooms. From above we hear the MUFFLED SOtJV OF THE

<b>          ROCK AND ROLL BAND.
</b>          Fenwick is in his early 20s and dressed in the "JOE
          COLLEGE." style of the late fifties. Sports jacket, button-
          down shirt, chino pants, and Bass weejuns. We sense
          that he is a little lost in himself, confused. He looks
          out one of the windows that views the parking lot. Then
          without any outward anger, he punches his fist through a
          window pane. Seconds later he breaks another window with
          his fist.

          Fenwick, picking up the music beat from above, struts to
          the sound as he approaches another bank of windows. He
          calmly breaks another window pane with. his fist.
          A GUY coming out of the bathroom in the b.g . sees Fenwick's
          actions and then heads up the steps.

          The crowd is gathered around the bandstand listening to
          the local group, the SH K RS, playing their popular hit
          HOT NUTS. The song is played toward the end of the even-
          ing because of its risque Lyrics.

          As the crowd swings the verse back to the Band Leader.
          The Guy who spotted Fenwick breaking windows approaches
          BOOGIE. Boogie is something of a "Dandy," flashiar
          in dress than others in his crowd. Although he isn't
          particularly good looking there is something about his
          attitude that is very appealing to girls. Boogie

          They don't respond. Eddie sits at the bar amused. Billy
          claps his hands to a strong rhythm, but of course, the
          guys pay no attention.
          Billy goes up on the stage and pulls a cover off a small
          piano in the corner. He sits down and runs his fingers
          down the keyboard, then starts to play. It bas a nice,
          pleasant sound to it. The dr er and the saxophonist
          stop, not knowing what to do. The Stripper also stops.
          The club bouncer at the front door turns toward the stage,
          notices something is wrong and makes his way forward.
          Billy's "piano playing becomes more intense. Stronger. He
          drives the keys hard. Full tilt rock ane roll. The sound
          becomes infectious. The sailors and other customers pick
          up the beat. One after another they start to pound the
          tables with the wooden mallets.
          Eddie moves toward the stage banging empty beer battles
          together .
          The saxophonist joins Billy. Then the dry--?e,. The
          Stripper stands by the side of the stage watching. The
          music builds.
          Billy's fingers pound the piano. Eddie jL ps up on the
          stage and starts dancing around. He grabs the Stripper
          and they jitterbug.
          The sailors and other customers are cn their feet, banging
          .the mallets Cr. the tables for all they are worth. A room
          full of dr-=..e,s. The Lemon heightens.
          Billy kicks back the stool a la Jerry Lee Lewis. The crowd
          cheers. The bouncer cheers along.
          The saxophonist struts the stage playing his heart out.
          The dr'er drives the bass dr.:.m with his foot. His hands
          sweep back and forth across the skins.
          Eddie's feet are flying. Enthusiasm over grace. The Scrip
          per is a whirlwind of motion and sexuality. The tempo is
          fierce.

          The MUSIC BEGINS. However, it is not the traditional
          wedding math but rather the Baltimore Colts'Fight Song.
          Even though the organist has softened it, there is still
          _a _"rah-rah" quality to it. The flower girl comes down the---
