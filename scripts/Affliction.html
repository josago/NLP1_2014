               Still-life tableaus. Lawford, N.H., a town of fifty buildings 
               on a glacial ridge, neither mountain nor plateau. Developed 
               as 1880's forestland, discarded in the Depression. Winter 
               has set in. Halloween day. Snowy fields yield to overcast 
               skies: oppressive, horizonless, flourescent.

               -- Wickham's Restaurant. Where Route 29 bends. 24-hour diner. 
               Margie Fogg works here.

               -- Trailer park in shadow of Parker Mountain. Home of Wade 
               Whitehouse.

               -- Toby's Inn. Roadhouse three miles from town on the river 
               side of Route 29. Everything not tied down ends up here.

               -- Glen Whitehouse farm. White clapboard.

               -- First Congregational Church. North on the Common from 
               City Hall.

               -- LaRiviere Co. Ramshackle well-digging firm embarrassingly 
               near the town center. Wade works here.

               -- Merritt's Shell Station. Cinder-block.

               -- Alma Pittman's house. Like so many others.

               -- Town Hall.

<b>                                     ROLFE (V.O.)
</b>                         This is the story of my older 
                         brother's strange criminal behavior 
                         and disappearance. We who loved him 
                         no longer speak of Wade. It's as if 
                         he never existed. By telling his 
                         story like this, as his brother, I 
                         separate myself from his family and 
                         those who loved him. Everything of 
                         importance -- that is, everything 
                         that gives rise to the telling of 
                         this story -- occurred during a single 
                         deer-hunting season in a small town 
                         in upstate New Hampshire where Wade 
                         was raised and so was I. One night 
                         something changed and my relation to 
                         Wade's story was different from what 
                         it had been since childhood. I mark 
                         this change by Wade's tone of voice 
                         during a phone call two nights after 
                         Halloween. Something I had not heard 
                         before. Let us imagine that around 
                         eight o'clock on Halloween Eve, 
                         speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes 
                         a pale green eight-year-old Ford 
                         Fairlane with a police bubble on 
                         top. A square-faced man wearing a 
                         trooper's cap is driving the vehicle. 
                         Beside him sits a child, a little 
                         girl with a plastic tiger mask 
                         covering her face. The man is driving 
                         fast --

               -- Route 29 tableau dissolves to night. A pale green police 
               Ford Fairlane drives past.

               Wade grimaces, holds his jaw. The Fairlane swerves around

               The Fairlane approaches Town Hall, a square two-story building 
               on the north side of the Common. Exhaust billows from idling 
               cars as parents and children come and go.

               Clowns, tramps, angels and vampires fill the brightly lit 
               room. Parents watch from the walls as GORDON LARIVIERE, a 
               beefy fiftiesh man with a silver flat-top, announces the 
               costume contest. Wade nods to various townspeople.

               Jill steps forward, retreats. Wade looks at her flaxen hair, 
               her blue sneakers protruding from her pathetic costume. His

<b>               INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

               On stage, LaRiviere arranges the contest winners. A fairy 
               godmother with a wand beams while, nearby, a hobo writhes in 
               his mother's grip -- a hard loser.

               Wade looks for Jill, first among the winners, then among the 
               losers; she's nowhere to be found. He heads toward a hall 
               leading to the restrooms.

               Jill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone, tiny, 
               forlorn. Wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her 
               before she had found a friend.

               Most parents have left or are leaving with their costumed 
               children. Hewitt's burgundy pickup breaks alongside the Audi. 
               Wade swings open the passenger door, jumps to the ground:

               LILLIAN, 40, attractive in an ankle-length hooded coat. 
               Whatever pose Wade strikes, she strikes the opposite. Her 
               dress and demeanor set her apart.

</b>                         Me and Jill, we just had a little 
                         spat. She felt kind of left out, I 
                         guess, from not knowing some of the 
                         new kids --

               Jack and Hettie neck inside the cab.

               Jill at the window in her tiger mask. Lillian waves; Jill 
               motions she'll be down.

</b>                         Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It 
                         looks like you've won this fucking

                         for Christ's sake.

               HORNER, 45, Lillian's new husband, thin with thinning hair 
               and a Tyrolean hat, sees Jill at the entrance and heads toward 
               her.

</b>                         Horner! Leave her be. This's got 
                         nothing to do with you, so just act 
                         like the chauffeur. Got it?

</b>                         Wade. Nobody wants any trouble.

               Horner greets Jill, walks her to the silver Audi. Passing 
               parents, listening, give Wade a wide berth.

</b>                         Don't cause a scene. No one's trying 
                         to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it 
                         any worse.

</b>                         I'm not making it any worse. You 
                         are. Me and Jill could've worked 
                         this thing out. It's normal, it's 
                         even normal for me to get a little 
                         touchy about it. Believe it or not. 
                         How do you think this makes me look, 
                         treating her like some tragic victim 
                         or something?

               Horner opens the car door for Jill, shuts it. Wade shoves 
               him:

<b>                                     WADE

                         goddamnit!

               Horner's hat falls. Lillian, icy, stares at Wade. He backs 
               off. Wade sometimes wonders: how'd Lillian Pittman of Lawford, 
               N.H., get so much class?

<b>                                     WADE
</b>                         Don't you say a word. I didn't hit 
                         him. I'm not going to hit anybody.

               Horner sits behind the wheel. Lillian silently stares Wade 
               up and down, gets in the car beside Jill. The automatic locks 
               latch as the Audi drives away. Its taillights merge with 
               vanishing traffic.

               Wade looks down, picks up Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat, 
               examines it, as if unsure of its function.

               Wade walks toward Town Hall. MARGIE FOGG, exiting, greets 
               him:

               NICK WICKHAM, 45, Marg's boss, passes by:

                         I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.

               Wade, lost in thought, continues toward Town Hall. At the 
               door, LaRiviere, one of the last to leave, eyes him. Wade 
               tosses Horner's hat inside.

               Wade nods as he lights a cigarette. Alone, he watches the 
               last cars pull out. He holds his jaw.

               Wade Whitehouse rolls over, runs his tongue across mossy 
               teeth, shuts off the music. He looks out the window, grunts: 
               "Shit!" He steps over to the phone by the frayed plaid couch, 
               dials.

               Wade's trailer is surprisingly neat, considering its owner 
               smokes too much, drinks too much, eats take-out and rarely 
               cleans up.

<b>               EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING
</b>
               Wade Whitehouse, wearing a reflective vest, waves a district 
               school bus into the parking lot. Noisy, jostling grade 
               schoolers emerge from the bus. Jill's former classmates. 
               Straight as a statue, Wade holds back traffic. Cars and trucks 
               are backed up on the unplowed road. Horns honk and bleat; a 
               woman's voice yells, "Whitehouse, we 'ain't got all day!"

               Wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion. Oblivious -- 
               or just plum contrary.

               A shiny black BMW approaches, speeding, passing traffic on 
               the shoulder. A man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front, 
               two children in back. Whitehouse waves for it to stop.

               The BMW accelerates through the intersection, ignoring Wade 
               and the traffic. It whizzes past, spinning Wade, and is 
               quickly up the road, spewing ice and exhaust. Wade slips to 
               one knee. Honking ensues; every car goes where it wishes.

               Wade, brushing off snow, follows the last bus as it pulls 
               in. LUGENE BROOKS, 60, school principal, rushes over:

                         some big weekend party planned.

               Wade sets his face, thinking.

               Snowprints lead from Jack's pickup to where he and Twombley 
               walk, guns pointed skyward. They enter a line of trees.

               Jack watches Twombley walk ahead of him, wrapped like a huge 
               infant in red bunting, crunching twigs underfoot. He looks 
               from side to side, checks his gun, returns to watching 
               Twombley. They're alone.

               Twombley nods, slips, thumps to the ground. His rifle lands 
               silently.

               Jack sprints over, helps him up, safety latches the 
               Winchester. Hands it back.

               his rifle at Twombley as he approaches.

               Jack and Twombley walk through fresh snow. The hillside's

               Twombley peers over a slight cliff at a lumber trail twenty

               Jack zig-zags down the incline, while Twombley, gun poised, 
               waddles along the edge.

               Jack stops fifty feet away, watches Twombley, a cartoon 
               character. A stag pokes his nose through the pines, steps 
               into a clearing. Jack aims his rifle, looks at Twombley.

               An open cab grader ("Our Business Is Going In The Hole") 
               sits in the rutted lot outside Toby's, a beer joint with 
               fake wood siding and 24-hour neon sign.

               A four-wheel drive plow with the LaRiviere motto pulls in, 
               parks beside the blue grader. JIMMY DAME, 40, gets out, 
               glances at the grader as he enters.

               bullshits with two long-haired locals at a nearby table; 
               their conversation drifts in and out. Country music plays

                         shooting himself. I've been wondering

               He shoots Twombley with his own gun.

                         Elbourne? You love me boys? Do you 
                         love your Pop? Of course you do!

               Wade, frightened, retreats as Sally enters in her housecoat.

               Glen reaches for the Canadian Club; Sally tries to block his 
               hand. Glen pulls his arm from hers, clipping her cheek with 
               the bottle.

               Sally gasps, grabs her cheek.

               Wade pushes between them, protecting his mother.

               for help.

               Pop's fist comes crashing down. Wade raises his arms to 
               protect himself. Wade's arm bone CRACKS with the blow. Wade 
               grimaces in pain.

               Rev. Doughty calls for Glen Whitehouse, who has been sitting,

               Wade stiffens. Pop cocks his fist. Marg, screaming, jumps 
               between them as Pop swings.

               The old man bounces blows off Margie's arms and shoulders.

               Wade pushes Marg aside, grabs his father in a bear hug and 
               walks him backwards, flat against the wall. Wade releases 
               him. Pop, frail, collapses to the floor. Wade kneels over

                         northward to Concord where it melted 
                         by midmorning.

               Rev. Doughty finishes. The mourners exchange farewells. Wade

               let him be. He walks over, hugs Jill.

               the barn. Firewood's stacked alongside.

                         in the union who don't want Twombley 
                         to testify. They probably include 
                         his son-in-law who's vice-president 
                         and will probably be the next 
                         president. I read that in the papers.

                         of illegal union loans or whatever, 
                         starts nosing around cause of the 
                         investigation and finds out. Finds 
                         out his son-in-law is involved.

                         professional hit. That'd make the 
                         feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

               Wade, driving Gordon's 4x4 with running lights and roll bar, 
               takes 29 toward Pop's farm.

               A pickup passes him: Jack Hewitt's burgundy Ford. Wade stops. 
               Jack turns up Parker Mountain -- the road to the accident 
               scene. Something's up.

               Wade turns and follows. Jack's fresh tracks lead the way. 
               Hewitt is driving fast. Wade keeps up.

               Jack, far ahead, approaches the accident scene. Stops. Night 
               has fallen.

               Wade comes over a low rise, spots Jack's pickup. He kills 
               the lights, parks to block Jack's exit.

               Silence. Footsteps in the snow. Wade watches, listens. What's 
               he doing? Looking for evidence?

               The burgundy pickup engine suddenly ROARS -- Jack's back and 
               at the wheel -- the tires squeal, spit snow as he spins past 
               Wade.

               Wade starts his engine, gives pursuit. The pickups gun their 
               engines, bumper to bumper, down mountain roads, lumber roads, 
               rocky trails. Wild headlamps their only guide.

               A trail turns sharply past a shallow beaver pond -- too 
               sharply for Jack. He crashes through a stand of skinny birches 
               straight out onto the pond. The pickup's momentum carries it 
               across the pond.

               Wade drops into first gear, follows, his headlights reflecting 
               ice. He drives directly to Jack, bumper to bumper, headlight 
               to headlight. Jack sticks his head out:

<b>                                     JACK

                         Get off!

               Wade doesn't budge. Jack backs away; Wade inches forward.

               Hewitt's trapped. Trees behind him. Neither truck has traction 
               on ice.

               Jack steps out, swinging his fists wildly. Wade gets out. 
               Jacks grabs his rifle, points it:

<b>                                     JACK

                         don't move away from that truck!

                         you move!

               Jack gets back in his pickup, maneuvers it slowly around the 
               Dodge, crosses the ice and is gone.

               Wade stands in darkness. The only sound his idling truck, 
               the wind. Then a third sound -- the snap of ice. Ice cracks 
               ripple from the middle of the pond. Ice planes tip around 
               the truck.

               LaRiviere's snazzy Dodge slips, descends, disappears.

               Headlights glow under water, then go out. "Our Business Is 
               Going In The Hole."

               Wade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to 
               shore. Freezing, he finds Jack's tire tracks in the snow. He 
               bangs his jaw.

               Wade drives Margie's car toward LaRiviere's. In his rear 
               view window he spots Chick Ward driving Chub Merritt's tow 
               truck, lights blinking, pulling LaRiviere's pickup like a 
               dead fish.

               He pulls over, lets it pass. He's parked in front of Alma 
               Pittman's house. A sign on the lawn reads, "Alma Pittman, 
               Town Clerk."

               He looks at the house, decides to go in. Wade walks up the

               Wade, open phone book in hand, walks back and forth speaking 
               into the receiver. Margie looks up from the KITCHEN table, 
               an old newspaper in front of her.

               The other party has hung up. Margie stands, upset. Wade slams 
               the phone down.

                         matter a bit.

               Pop enters from outside with firewood, passes.

</b>                         I'll get another job. People are 
                         going to need me. After this is over, 
                         they'll make me into a Goddamned

                         they can send me howling into a corner 
                         like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll 
                         be different soon.

               Margie's face falls. She retreats from the room as he speaks, 
               taking her coat and pocketbook. Wade and his old man, she 
               thinks: just the same.

               Wade looks out the window and she gets in her car, drives 
               off.

               Wade holds his inflamed jaw; he can hardly see straight. Pop 
               turns on the TV in the living room, boosts the volume.

               Pop comes back in the room, gets the Canadian Club, pours 
               himself a drink.

</b>                         Leave the bottle out!

               Pop growls, goes back to wrestling on the TV. Wade walks to 
               the cabinet, removes a pair of pliers from the tool drawer, 
               goes toward the bathroom.

               In the BATHROOM, Wade opens his mouth -- it hurts -- takes a 
               bite of whisky, sets the bottle on the toilet tank.

               He looks at the stranger in the mirror, reaches inside his 
               mouth with the pliers. Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse 
               locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes 
               and pulls.

               He steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from 
               his mouth. The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink. He 
               takes another bite of whisky.

               Rolfe's voice plays over:

                         and perhaps I should have. But even 
                         so, what could I have done by then? 
                         Wade never went inside. He lived 
                         almost wholly out there on his skin, 
                         with no interior space to retreat 
                         to, even in a crisis.

               Wade takes another swig, sets the whisky bottle in the LIVING 
               ROOM beside the TV set. Wade and Pop exchange looks.

               Wade exits through the KITCHEN, snatching his coat.

               gasoline from under the porch.

               He crosses to the barn, prepares to pour the gas into the 
               beat-up red truck.

               Wade and Jill enter Wickham's, crowded with out-of-state 
               hunters at the end of the deer season.

               Wade, flaring, reaches across the counter and grabs Nick by 
               the shirtfront! Nick's arm knocks over a cup of coffee.

               The diner goes silent. Hunters look up. Jill's face is white; 
               she starts to cry.

               Wade looks over -- it takes him a moment to react -- bends 
               down, comforting her. He wipes her nose with a napkin.

               Jill waits in the old red truck parked outside.

               Wade emerges with cardboard boxes of office miscellany, rifles 
               laid across top. He shoves the boxes and guns into the back 
               of the pickup, gets in and drives off.

               Wade and Jill pull up the drive, past Margie's car, into the 
               barn. Her trunk and two side doors are open.

               Margie comes out back with a battered suitcase, goes to her 
               car. She's leaving. A plastic bag of clothes sits in the 
               trunk.

               Wade and Jill get out, approach:

</b>                         Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.

               Jill, suitcase in hand, looking pathetic, tries to smile. A 
               sadness passes over Wade's face.

<b>                                     WADE

                         Marg.

               Margie, watching him, quivers, starts to cry. She drops her 
               suitcase, out of nowhere bawling like a baby.

               Wade goes over, puts his arms around her, pats her back. His 
               face is racked. He, too, seems about to cry -- if he could.

               In his arms Margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by Wade's 
               circumstances and terrible sadness. She pushes:

<b>                                     MARGIE

                         Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

               She struggles in Wade's grasp. Jill, frightened, wildly hits 
               him from behind:

               Wade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms. 
               Jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying.

               Wade stumbles backwards into the snow. Jill still swings. 
               Margie dashes to intervene as Wade swings his arms wide.

               Jill flies into Marg. Her nose is bleeding. Wade's caught 
               her across the mouth and nose. She takes cover behind Margie, 
               crying.

               Margie and Jill stand side by side, saying nothing. Wade 
               looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock. Marg slowly backs 
               away, her arms behind her holding Jill.

                         Get in.

               Marg eases Jill into the front seat, closes the door, edges 
               around the car slamming the trunk and gets into the driver's 
               seat. Wade stands.

               She closes the front door, starts the car. She backs out the 
               drive.

               In her rear view mirror she sees the image of Wade receding, 
               standing frozen, staring down at the snow. Pop emerges from 
               the house, looks at his son, grinning.

               Wade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered 
               on his father's face. Glen Whitehouse holds an empty whiskey 
               bottle like a pistol.

               Hunters' gunshots echo in the distance.

               Wade unloads the cardboard boxes filled with his office 
               belongings from the back of the truck and sets them on the 
               ground. He gathers up his rifles.

               Suddenly! A whiskey bottle SLAMS against the back of his 
               head. He drops to his knees, the guns scatter. He looks up 
               with child's fear and guilt at his father.

               Glen Whitehouse hovers over him, huge and ferocious: a 
               colossus, lifting the bottle like a jawbone.

               Wade cringes, scrambles for the dropped rifle. He grabs it 
               by the barrel and, twisting around, swings it in a slow motion 
               arc, smashing the edge of the wood stock against his father's 
               head. A cold hard CRACK of bone.

               Glen Whitehouse -- shriveled again, no longer mythic -- flies 
               back like a stuffed dummy. He collapses beside the empty 
               C.C. bottle.

               Wade, bleeding from the head, stands, staggers off Pop's 
               inert body, aims his rifle at the old man's face.

               Wade bolts the rifle, flicks off the safety, fires -- a loud 
               CLICK. The gun's empty.

<b>                                     WADE

                         Joke. You scared me.

               He kneels down, lovingly touches the old man's face, caresses 
               his lips, cheeks, nose, brows, smoothes back his stiff gray 
               hair.

               Pop's eyes are clouded. Blood suddenly drips from his ear to 
               the ground.

               Wade rests the rifle against the truck. He bends over, slips 
               his hands under his father's body, lifts him up. He carries 
               Pop over to the workbench, lays him out.

               Groping beneath the bench, Wade finds the kerosene lamp. He 
               unscrews it, pours kerosene the length of Pop's body.

               Wade takes out his cigarette lighter, ignites it, holds it 
               for a moment, places it to Glen Whitehouse.

               Fire spreads the length of Pop's body, bursting like a shroud 
               of yellow flame. The oil-stained bench crackles; flames shoot 
               up the old weathered wall.

               Burning flesh and heat drive Wade backwards.

                         beaten by their fathers, whose 
                         capacity for love and trust was 
                         crippled almost at birth and whose 
                         best hope, if any, for connection 
                         with other human beings lay in an 
                         elegiac detachment, as if life were 
                         over.

<b>               EXT. PARKER MOUNTAIN - DAY
</b>
               Pop's red truck is parked behind Jack Hewitt's 4x4 on a snow-
               banked road. Wade, hunting rifle pointed up, traces Jack's 
               footsteps down the slope of the mountain.

</b>                         It's how we keep from destroying in 
                         turn our own children and terrorizing 
                         the women who have the misfortune to 
                         love us; how we absent ourselves 
                         from the tradition of male violence; 
                         how we decline the seduction of 
                         revenge.

               Wade spots Jack poised in a spruce grove, watching for deer. 
               Wade bolts his rifle, releases the safety, aims and FIRES.

               Jack, hit in the chest, falls bleeding between trees. Blood 
               stains the snow.

</b>                         Jack's truck turned up three days 
                         later in a shopping mall in Toronto. 
                         Even without the footprints, the 
                         bullet, Wade's utter disappearance 
                         seemed evidence enough of his guilt.

               Camera glides from room to room, glimpsing details, fragments 
               of former times, as if this were an historical site or 
               memorial. The walls resonate: lives were molded here.

</b>                         LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed 
                         in business. The Parker Mountain Ski 
                         Resort is now advertised all across 
                         the country. Jimmy Dame tends bar at 
                         the lodge. Chub Merritt opened a 
                         snowmobile dealership, Nick Wickham 
                         runs the new Burger King. Margie 
                         Fogg moved to Littleton, nearer her 
                         mother; Lillian and Jill went with 
                         Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle.

               Out a window, workers gather charred timbers from the barn, 
               throw them on a truck.

</b>                         We want to believe Wade died, died 
                         that same November, froze to death 
                         on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot 
                         understand how a man, a normal man, 
                         a man like you and me, could do such 
                         a terrible thing. Unless the police 
                         happen to arrest a vagrant who turns 
                         out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe 
                         he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will 
                         have turned himself into one of those 
                         faceless fellows working at the video 
                         store and lives in a town-house 
                         apartment at the edge of town until 
                         his mailman recognizes him from the 
                         picture at the post office -- unless 
                         that happens, there will be no more 
                         mention of him and his friend Jack 
                         Hewitt and our father. The story 
                         will be over. Except that I continue.
