</b>          An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy
          receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced
          reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...

</b>          A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.
          MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-
          stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have
          time for office parties, she's working.
<b>          
</b>          Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as
          he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a

          Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid

<b>          
</b>          He climbs into his front seat, and as he pulls out of the

</b>          Gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: CASS, HANDKERCHIEF
          OVER HER NOSE, PACK OF FLAMING MATCHES IN HAND. Cass tosses
          the matches and handkerchief, AND PUNCHES MILO IN THE BALLS.
<b>          
</b>          Milo groans and crumbles to the ground. Cass jumps out of the

</b>                       And we think they're ditching it
                       tonight.
<b>          
</b>          A SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the
          motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT
<b>          COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE
</b><b>          OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          "SPARROW".
</b><b>          
</b><b>                                 BOBBY
</b><b>                           (CASUALLY)
</b>                       You know, if I was them, I'd store
                       the evidence on a boat, drive the
                       boat about 30 miles out, and blow
                       the whole thing up.
<b>          
</b>          Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN
          AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look:
<b>          
</b><b>                                 BOBBY
</b>                       Hey, man. I got mouths to feed.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 103.

</b><b>                              MILO
</b>                    Aw. That's what all the dirty cops
                    say.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He
          steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the
          motorboats engine.
<b>          
</b>          Milo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER
<b>          THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO
</b><b>          SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR.
</b><b>          
</b>          Milo struggles back up to a seated position.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BOBBY
</b>                    You've always been such a stubborn
                    asshole, Milo. You just don't
                    listen. All you had to do was stay
                    where I told you and none of this
                    would have happen. Now the two of
                    you are gonna have to go down with
                    the boat.

</b><b>                              MILO
</b>                    Ok. Here's what we do. We're going
