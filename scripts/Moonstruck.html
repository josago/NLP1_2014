<b>               INT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY
</b>
               Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on 
               end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end 
               in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.

               We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products 
               calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is 
               November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been 
               penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica 
               counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter, 
               in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat 
               red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE 
<b>               WHITE BACKGROUND.

</b>
               Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low 
<b>               TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.
</b>
<b>                                     ZITO'S VOICE
</b>                              (barely discernable)
                         Three times they cancel the order 
                         with me, and three times they come 
                         back. Who they kidding? They cheap, 
                         cheap, cheap. The other bread they 
                         get is no good. They save pennies. 
                         Everybody complain and they come 
                         back. "Zito, your bread is the best." 
                         They're like children stupid in school 
                         who cannot learn. The water. It's 
                         the water. You buy bread in Hoboken, 
                         you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water 
                         is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask 
                         your father. He knows.

               During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE 
               DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently 
               with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the 
               pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.

<b>               NOW WE SEE ZITO
</b>
               He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's 
               early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, 
               so he's a little tired and disgruntled.

<b>               NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME
</b>
               She's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is 
               Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked 
               with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes 
               of a dark color.

<b>               EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY
</b>
               Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping 
               satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She 
               moves off briskly.

               This is a little Italian funeral parlor.

<b>               INT. THE "WAKE" ROOM"
</b>
               A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes, 
               many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front, 
               the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and 
               formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We 
               discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises.

               She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over 
               and says.

<b>               INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR
</b>
               First WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO 
               CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE.

<b>                                     CONTI'S VOICE

               The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half 
               cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming 
               mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's 
               tabulations.

<b>                                     LORETTA'S VOICE
</b>                         If you're such an artistic genius, 
                         why can't you keep track of your 
                         receipts? How am I going to do your 
                         income tax?

</b>                         I am an artistic genius.

               The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta 
               sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of 
               coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering 
               figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger.

<b>                                     LORETTA
</b>                         If you're an artistic genius, how 
                         come you got butter on your tie?

               He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss.

<b>                                     LORETTA
</b>                         Give it here. I'll give you this, 
                         Al, you make good coffee.

               She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has 
               taken off, and slams the ledger shut.

<b>               INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL
</b>
               We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They 
               are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall 
               starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes 
               are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is 
               ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. 
               He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, 
               heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that 
               Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a 
               ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. 
               After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something 
               to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and

<b>               INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
</b>
               WE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.

               Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping 
               block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits, 
               unskinned.

<b>               INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY
</b>
               A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the 
<b>               FLORIST'S VOICE.
</b>
<b>                                     FLORIST'S VOICE
</b>                         Red roses. Very romantic. The man 
                         who sends these knows what he's doing.

               Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the 
               box of roses.

<b>                                     LORETTA
</b>                         The man who sends those spends a lot 
                         of money on something that ends up 
                         in the garbage can.

               The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.

<b>                                     FLORIST
</b>                         I'm glad everybody ain't like you, 
                         Loretta. I'd be outta business.

<b>                                     LORETTA
</b>                         Without me, you'd be out of business. 
                         I like flowers.

               She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first 
               time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of 
               her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red 
               rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.

<b>               EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
               A red neon sign hangs in the window.

               It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A 
               YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested 
               in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.

</b>
               White tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the 
               door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That's because 
               they're all related. The place is about half full, and bustles 
               along pleasantly.

<b>               MUSIC
</b>
               A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.

               MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.

               They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is 
               Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is 
               impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens 
               to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a 
               pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a 
               mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is 
               Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked 
               with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and 
               high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.

               Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who 
               hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.

               Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she 
               watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.

               BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their 
               order.

               About a third of the windows in the house are lit.

               From within can be HEARD the faint strains of VICKI CARR 
               SINGING and one DOG BARKING. Loretta appears, carrying 
               champagne, approaches the front door, unlocks it, and goes

               VICKI CARR is SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM."

               The front hall is typical of big old brownstones. There's a 
               big old oak coat rack with a built-in mirror and an umbrella 
               stand. There are several coats hanging from it. The floor is

               On the table is a large cut-glass bowl filled with a couple

               Loretta comes in and takes off her coat. A single MAD HOWL

               off the old stereo. He is a powerful man, about 65, with a 
               huge shock of white hair and gold wire glasses. He's wearing 
               a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas, and royal blue 
               slippers. The room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture, 
               once grand, now threadbare; shawls and doilies cover holes 
               in failing fabric. There's a fireplace containing a dying

               Loretta and Cosmo sit at the kitchen table. It's a big tin 
               table with a black-and-white design. Loretta has put two old- 
               fashioned champagne glasses on the table, the split of 
               champagne, a bag of sugar cubes, and a bottle of bitters.

               She pours the champagne, drops a little lump of sugar into

               The gates in the big archway are opened from the inside.

               It's Cosmo. He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an 
               overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black 
               Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he 
               gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and 
               goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man 
               approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.

               The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.

               Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and 
               son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective 
               door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the 
               same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.

               Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears 
               within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.

</b>
               Receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of 
               satisfaction. A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around 
               until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread 
               with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.

               Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula 
               flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the 
               cooked side.

               Two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in 
               the bread.

               The circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula, 
               scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs.

               A WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash 
               of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results 
               from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates.

               Now WE SEE that Loretta is just finishing setting the tin 
               table for two. In the b.g., Rose is turning away from the 
               big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled 
               coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes 
               toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a 
               nice old apron over a blue housedress. She's thoughtful.

               As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work 
               shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As 
               Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta, 
               who's at the stove.

               Loretta returns with the coffeepot to the table, and pours.

               Then she takes the pot back to the stove.

               By the bed are THREE MOURNERS, old crones dressed in black.

               One clutches a missal, the other two clutch rosaries. All

               various pieces of baking equipment, dough-mixers, etc., 
               scattered willy-nilly. And everywhere there is bread.

               PIETRO, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long 
               wooden spatula. RONNY is working at the other oven.

               Actually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking 
               bread and burning coals. He's dressed in black jeans streaked 
               with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves, 
               and around his neck, a red handkerchief. He is black-haired, 
               handsome and intense.

               He picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven.

                         I was engaged to be married. Johnny 
                         came in here, he ordered bread from 
                         me. I put it in the slicer and I 
                         talked with him and my hand got caught 
                         cause I wasn't paying attention. The 
                         slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 
                         'cause - when my fiancé saw that I 
                         was maimed, she left me for another 
                         man.

               He goes to the big table, which is floured and covered with 
               bread. He sweeps everything off the tabletop during the next.

               The table is bare. He stares at it blankly. He wanders away, 
               to the back room where the flour sacks are kept. We hear a 
               single sob escape him from that room, and then silence.

               Everyone in the oven room looks after him. Then Chrissy 
               approaches Loretta. She holds the big knife at her side.

               Loretta considers Chrissy, decides what she's going to do, 
               and goes to the flour room.

               Many 50 lb. bags of flour are stacked under a bare electric

               a glass case displaying various desserts, and behind the 
               case, a big burnished gold cappuccino machine. The place is 
               almost empty.

               The CAMERA TRAVELS along the face of an exposed brick wall,

               TO the figure of COSMO. He's sitting at a table which is 
               inset into a nook, so we cannot see who he's with.

               At a little table away from prying eyes, Cosmo sits with

               It's a two-bedroom apartment. The decor reflects Ronny's 
               love of the opera. The furniture is overstuffed, fringed in 
               the colors of Italian passion. But it is all a bit faded, 
               the remains of an old flamboyance. The walls are decorated 
               with opera posters; and over the fireplace there is a painting 
               depicting a scene from "La Boheme": Mimi is standing in the 
               snow. Ronny stares at the picture of Mimi in the La Boheme 
               poster. Loretta comes in from the kitchen and sets down a 
               cup of coffee.

</b>                         I was raised that a girl gets married 
                         young. I didn't get married until I 
                         was twenty-eight. I met a man. I 
                         loved him. I married him. He wanted 
                         to have a baby right away. I said 
                         no. Then he got hit by a bus. No 
                         man. No baby. No nothing! I did not 
                         know that man was a gift I could not 
                         keep. I didn't know... You tell me a 
                         story and you think you know what it 
                         means, but I see what the true story

               the fifth Judas is whining. He looks around at the other

               Judas is running down the stairs and into the hall. We FOLLOW 
               HIM down the hall. The hall is only dimly lit. He finds the 
               four other dogs. They are crowded at a narrow doorway.

               From the doorway comes a golden light.

               We are in the Castorini dining room. Cosmo sits at the head 
               of the table, a napkin tucked into his shirt.

               Rose has just laid down a massive platter of steaming baked 
               fish. Already on the table is a platter of pasta, loaves of 
               bread, a big bowl of salad, two bottles of wine, and an 
               appetizer plate of salami and pimento. Seated at the table 
               is COSMO, the Old Man, and RAYMOND and RITA CAPPOMAGGI.

               Raymond is rotund, moon-faced, bald, somewhere in his fifties.

               He has a pencil-thin mustache over his small mouth. His wife, 
               Rita, looks very like him, except she has hair on her head 
               and none on her lip. Raymond is Rose's brother. There are 
               two empty places at table, for Rose and Loretta.

               The Old Man has piled his plate high with food. Now he stands 
               up, walks over to the Dogs, and puts the plate down in their 
               midst. The Dogs attack the food and each other. The Old Man 
               walks back to the table and sits down. He looks down at the 
               empty place in front of him, a little sad.

               Rose gets another plate from a sideboard and puts it in front

               his new plate. Rose goes to her place and sits down.

                         the house all day and look in the

                         it's not really a story. But one 
                         time I woke up in the middle of the

                         think a what it was. I looked out 
                         the window, and it was the moon! Big 
                         as a house! I never seen the moon so 
                         big before or since. I was almost 
                         scared, like it was gonna crush the 
                         house. And I looked down, and standing 
                         there in the street was Cosmo, looking 
                         up at the windows. This is the funny 
                         part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I 
                         thought you brought this big moon 
                         over to my house cause you were so 
                         in love and woke me up with it. I 
                         was half asleep I guess and didn't 
                         know no better.

               Raymond stares at Cosmo, nodding, remembering. There's a 
               lull at the table, the SOUND of SILVERWARE.

               Provolones and salamis hang from above. To the one side is a 
               deli counter, to the other a series of tables displaying 
               cheeses by the pound, packaged cakes, etc. In the back are a 
               few tables and a kitchen with counter. Up front, behind the 
               deli counter, stands Rita Cappomaggi in a blue apron.

               Out by the tables, Raymond unpacks some jars of olives. In 
               the back, a TRUCK DRIVER can dimly be seen eating his lunch.

<b>               INT. A CHURCH BASEMENT
</b>
               It's been set up for a church bazaar. There are several wheels 
               of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game 
               of ring toss, etc. AS THE CAMERA inventories the contents of 
               the various stands -- a LITTLE NUN sleeps in one of them -- 
               we HEAR the Old Man's VOICE.

<b>                                     OLD MAN'S VOICE
</b>                         I've got a lot on my mind. Things 
                         are getting bad in my house. My 
                         daughter-in-law is mad at my son 
                         because he will not pay for the 
                         wedding.

<b>               A TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER
</b>
               An old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it 
               with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand 
               belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old 
               Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives 
               a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer.

               Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips 
               it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy 
               goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray 
               where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the 
               Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever 
               to drive the stake into the apple. This frustrates Felix.

                         the apple will fall off the stick.

               is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta 
               greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey 
               what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she 
               wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.

               There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various 
               dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some 
               incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in 
               a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her 
               because they're so sexy, one bores her. We don't see the 
               dress that she ultimately does buy.

               and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and 
               stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.

               Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy, 
               bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology, 
               and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop 
               window.

               A SINGLE BARK is HEARD from the top of the stairs. She looks 
               up.

               Loretta goes through a door and into the kitchen. She opens 
               the refrigerator and a cabinet, and makes herself a scotch 
               on the rocks. She sips it and starts to HUM in an understated 
               way. She takes her drink and wanders out of the kitchen.

               She walks to each lamp in the room and turns it on. There

               nicely. She puts her drink down and gets a big standing 
               antique mirror on rollers from its place against the wall.

               She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she 
               picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and 
               then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair. 
               Then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums.

               CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created 
               by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled 
               with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand 
               and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. 
               Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, 
               inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous 
               color.

<b>               LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN
</b>
               The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.

               She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights 
               up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger 
               jets.

               Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher 
               into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her 
               eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, 
               like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.

<b>               FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER

               Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for 
               its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing 
               quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite 
               side of the fountain, is Ronny.

               He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and 
               topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises 
               a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles 
               brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and 
               starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the 
               fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her 
               attempt at composure from, Ronny.

               Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around 
               the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her.

               Ronny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they 
               walk off in the direction of the opera house.

               already off, and he's helping Loretta off with hers. He hands 
               her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns 
               and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time.

               He's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles.

                         the Opera.

               His eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts 
               to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself.

               in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands.

               Next is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son, 
               John. They are seated and people are looking at them.

               Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down, 
               something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing 
               good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes 
               her look like a big piece of hard candy.

               Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row 
               of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.

               They are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program.

               She's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly 
               approaches her. She's very dignified.

               Jimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the 
               wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV, 
               and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, 
               is having an argument with the man across from her.

               But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and 
               the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's

               Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table 
               catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a 
               little louder.

                         how I feel, you explain how you feel. 
                         I don't think that's really much of

               Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at 
               the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the 
               man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument

               Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the 
               man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and 
               stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.

               When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to 
               Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his 
               50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the 
               earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with 
               beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and 
               apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.

</b>                         I teach these classes I've taught 
                         for a million years. The spontaneity 
                         went out of it for me a long time 
                         ago. I started off, I was excited 
                         about something and I wanted to share 
                         it. Now it's rote, it's the 
                         multiplication table. Except 
                         sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning 
                         along and I look up, and there's 
                         this fresh young beautiful face, and 
                         it's all new to her and I'm this 
                         great guy who's just brilliant and 
                         thinks out loud. And when that 
                         happens, when I look out among those 
                         chairs and look at a young woman's 
                         face, and see me there in her eyes, 
                         me the way I always wanted to be and 
                         maybe once was, then I ask her out 
                         on a date. It doesn't last. It can 
                         go for a few weeks or a couple of 
                         precious months, but then she catches 
                         on that I'm just a burnt out old 
                         gasbag and that she's as fresh and 
                         bright and full of promise as 
                         moonlight in a martini. And at that 
                         moment, she stands up and throws a 
                         glass of water in my face, or some 
                         action to that effect.

                         she was going to die. I knew she was 
                         sick...

               Ronny gets the coats and helps her on with hers.

               Ronny is putting on his coat.

</b>                         I know. She was coughing her brains

                         the time...

               Loretta has stopped suddenly, transfixed by the sight before 
               her.

               Loretta and Ronny are standing face-to-face with Cosmo and 
               Mona. Mona's wearing a coat like a wrapper for hard candy.

               Cosmo is wearing his coat and has his hat in his hand.

               Stunned at seeing Loretta, he unconsciously puts his hat on.

               Then he thinks about it and takes it off again. He looks at 
               Ronny. Then he looks at Mona.

               Ronny looks at Loretta. He waits to follow her lead.

               Mona obeys after looking curiously at Loretta.

               He takes Loretta's arm and steers her a distance away for a 
               confidential exchange.

               Cosmo puts on his hat again. He glares at Ronny. He looks at 
               Loretta, but he's at a total loss. At last, he stalks off. 
               Loretta looks after him, angry and disturbed.

               Rose and Perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly 
               shining. About half a block away stands the Castorini house.

               They regard it. Over the house hangs the moon, cut through

                              (nothing)
                         A person can see where they've messed 
                         up in their life, and they can change 
                         how they do things, and they can 
                         change their Luck. Maybe my nature 
                         does draw me to you, but I don't 
                         haveta go with that. I can take hold 
                         of myself and say yes to some things 
                         and no to something that's just gonna 
                         ruin everything! I can do that. 
                         Otherwise, what is this stupid life 
                         that God gave us for what?

<b>               NOW WE SEE THE STREET
</b>
               Just as the door shuts. A moment passes. Lights go on in 
               Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of 
               the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the 
               middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted 
               windows.

<b>               NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY

               Her heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks 
               up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one 
               slender, slender thread.

<b>               MUSIC
</b>
               It's "MIMI'S ARIA"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME.

<b>               WE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING

               At the lighted window above. "MIMI'S ARIA" PLAYS. This tableau 
               reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in 
               the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long 
               moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy 
               shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She 
               hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks 
               away down the street.

               With a great and abrupt ROAR, a big jet is landing.

<b>               INT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT
</b>
               PASSENGERS are pouring into the terminal from the plane.

               Most of them are Italian or Italian-Americans. Suddenly, Mr. 
               Johnny appears out of the shifting crowd, up very CLOSE to 
               the CAMERA. He looks alert, determined, geared up for action.

<b>               MR. JOHNNY AT THE LUGGAGE CAROUSEL
</b>
               He pulls his two suitcases off the carousel with one quick 
               powerful jerk.

               Mr. Johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes 
               to him.

               Mr. Johnny leans forward to the DRIVER and says in a very 
               definite, determined way.

               The cab pulling up to the Castorini house. The living room 
               windows are all lit up. VICKI CARR can be made out SINGING 
               "IT MUST BE HIM". Mr. Johnny gets out of the cab, gets his 
               luggage, and heads for the front door. He RINGS THE BELL.

               The door opens. It's Rose. MUSIC floods out around her.

               She holds the door open for him and he goes in past her 
               carrying his suitcases. She closes the door.

                         took a rib from Adam and made Eve. 
                         Maybe men chase women to get the rib 
                         back. When God took the rib, he left 
                         a hole there, place where there used 
                         to be something. and the women have 
                         that. Maybe a man isn't complete as 
                         a man without a woman.

                         one woman?

<b>               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAWN
</b>
               We watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house. It 
               begins in darkness, and goes through the many graduations of 
               light very quickly until it's lit by the light of bright 
               morning.

               He's got them on their leashes and, over his head, he carries 
               the black umbrella. He walks off toward the park and 
               disappears.

<b>               EXT. STREET - DAY - LORETTA IS WALKING
</b>
               Along a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. She is a wreck.

               She's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't 
               slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the 
               complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks 
               great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has 
               a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is 
               slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched 
               in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING. 
               We follow her as she SINGS and walks.

</b>
               She's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt. 
               She comes to it again. She kicks it again.

<b>               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Loretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and 
               enters the house.

<b>               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
               Rose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and 
               sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal.

               Another range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles 
               into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down.

               There are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta.

                         last night.

               Loretta is suddenly electrified.

</b>                         I guess it ain't modern times in 
                         Sicily. He came right from the 
                         airport. He wanted to talk to you. 
                         You got a love bite on your neck. 
                         He's coming back this morning.

               With a long low MOAN, Loretta lowers her head to the table.

<b>               EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
               Ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta 
               just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he 
               hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown 
               leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts 
               to SING "O SOAVE FANCIULLA". He SINGS it any old way, 
               occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just 
               muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he 
               remembers, which is a lot.

<b>               WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW
</b>
               He's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an 
               ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize 
               what he is singing. They start to SING along with him.

               They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a 
               resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other 
               appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back 
               to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.

<b>               EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Ronny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and 
               then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him 
               in.

<b>               INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN

               Rose walks in with Ronny behind her. There's no one in the

               Loretta comes out of a closet, where she was hiding. She's 
               very surprised to see Ronny.

                         Yes, I would like some oatmeal.

               Ronny and Loretta sit down and Rose serves them oatmeal.

               COSMO WALKS IN dressed for business. He regards the trio, 
               puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.

               Cosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of 
               him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he 
               puls down his spoon.

               Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.

               The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.

<b>               THE OLD MAN WALKS IN

               He looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him.

               He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his 
               hand opens in a gesture of supplication.

                         pay for the wedding of your only 
                         daughter. You are breaking your house

                         I'll pay for the whole thing.

               The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at 
               the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.

               He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.

               The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts 
               down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking 
               to Cosmo.

<b>                                     ROSE

               Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old 
               clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists 
               to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this. 
               Then slowly, he sits down.

                         A man... under stands one day... 
                         that his life is built on nothing.

               He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts 
               his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been 
               able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS.

               Loretta runs out of the kitchen and reappears with her

               it to Raymond.

               There is a general acknowledgment. Everybody wants coffee.

               Rose passes out white mugs and begins pouring steaming drafts 
               of coffee. Raymond and Rita are standing. The rest are 
               sitting.

               She takes the ring. Ronny and Loretta kiss.

               Ronny and Loretta enter into a long kiss. The Old Man starts 
               to cry. Cosmo leans forward to the Old Man solicitously.

               Loretta pushes Ronny away, breaking the kiss. They have both 
               neglected to breathe the whole time they were kissing.

               They are both gasping for air, especially Loretta.

               But then she looks at Ronny, and lunges back to him, diving 
               into another kiss like a mermaid diving into the bluest ocean.

               Glistening in sunlight on the white tabletop. Into each is 
               dropped a lump of sugar. A bottle of recently employed bitters 
               sits nearby with its cap off (like a respectful peasant in 
               aristocratic company. And the roses in the center.

               Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK. WE SEE the table is surrounded.

               Cosmo is dropping the last of the sugar cubes in the last 
               glass of champagne. Rose is by him. Rita and Raymond are 
               side by side, as are Ronny and Loretta. The Old Man sits, 
               staring at his son, intent and approving. But where is Mr. 
               Johnny?

                         Wait.

               The Old Man takes the glass and walks over to a corner of 
               the kitchen where Mr. Johnny, deeply disturbed and somewhat 
               catatonic, sits on a step-ladder.

               But the Old Man, wise and merry and tough, presses the glass 
               on Mr. Johnny, who takes it.

               Mr. Johnny sits without moving, holding his glass. A long 
               moment passes. Mr. Johnny is thinking. Then he nods to 
               himself. He lifts his glass and murmurs for no one to hear

               And he laughs his laugh. This laugh could kill him. The CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK a little. He pounds the table and knocks over the 
               roses.
