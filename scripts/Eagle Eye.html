</b>
          CLOSE ON A WOODEN STICK-FIGURE TOY, held by a SIX YEAR OLD BOY.
          Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing --
          CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a
          small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their
          MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned
          MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil
          scene of life in another part of the world...

<b>          EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with
          surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK
          MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to:

<b>          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN
</b>
          POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN
          SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the
          cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned
          Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES:

<b>          SPECIAL FORCES LEADER
</b>          We have visual onthetarget. Confirm
          'go' for UAV launch.

<b>          SUPER: "JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON"
</b>          Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes:
           SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American;
           eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL
          THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated).

<b>          COLONEL THOMPSON
</b>          Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active
          UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero.

<b>          EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN
</b>
          The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV
          into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent.

<b>          INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the
          caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling
          the drone from 6500 miles away:

          DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The
          drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield --

<b>          INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY
</b>
          Over speakers, VOICES speak "Balochi." A TRANSLATOR listens:

<b>          CALLISTER
</b>          Is it him?

<b>          TRANSLATOR
</b>          Four males, one of them's speaking with
          a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ€¢dialect,
          consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei.

<b>          COLONEL THOMPSON
</b>          Gimme voiceprint analysis.
          The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation.
          VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a

<b>          BEARDED MAN: "37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI."
</b>
<b>          CALLISTER
</b>          I'm not taking 37% to-the President...
          John, weigh in here?
          He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via
          teleconference from the White House Situation Room:

<b>          DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
</b>          CIA and NCTC concur this is the target
          based on reliable Intel from the Brits.
          WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road.

<b>          TECHIE
</b>          Sire they're pulling off the highway.

<b>          TECHIE #2
</b>          We have abort recommendation.
          The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The
          source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery.

<b>          COLONEL THOMPSON
</b>          If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
          once in a lifetime, we can't let him go.

          Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the
          vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge...
          INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints

<b>          COLONEL THOMPSON
</b>          Looks like a training camp.
          THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he
          emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the
          file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm.
          MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP:
          THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL
          WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH -

<b>          TECHIE
</b>          51%. 'Abort' rec holds.
          THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin
          MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of
          the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT.
          THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds:

<b>          CALLISTER
</b>          What is that, a weapons cache?

<b>          ANALYST
</b>          Sir, the placement of stones around the
          pit, markers for the Five Pillars of
          Islam... I think it's a funeral.
          Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated.
          THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted,
          shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the
          procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body...
          THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION

<b>          SCROLLS:

          The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in --

<b>          PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL
</b>          "Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open
          to international prosecution. But we
          have no independent intel verifying it's
          in fact a funeral, and the presence of
          weapons certainly leaves room for
          interpretation.

<b>          TECHIE #2
</b>          I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.

<b>          CALLISTER
</b>          (a beat, looks around).
          Everyone agree this is the best course of
          action?
          No one dissents. Callister picks up:

<b>          CALLISTER (CONT'D)
</b>          Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity
          match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some
          possibility he's at a funeral, but we
          don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks
          we can claim 'Overriding Legal
          Authority.' Also, you should be aware we
          have an abort recommendation, but your
          cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs
          urge a 'go.'

<b>          THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
</b>          You left yourself out of the lineup.
          Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS

<b>          BLINKING: "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT..."
</b>
<b>          CALLISTER
</b>          Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two
          standards: the highest probability of
          success with the least amount of
          collateral damage. At 51% probability,
          we don't have either one.

<b>          GENERAL THOMPSON
</b>          And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir,
          we're putting our people at risk.
          There's a long silence as the President considers.

</b>          I respect your caution, Geoff, but we
          won't get another chance like this... you
          have a green light.
          Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue:

<b>          CALLISTER
</b>          Understood.
          (hangs up)
          We're weapons free.
          And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:

          The women begin to SING the "Nasheen," a.funeral song praising
          Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE.
          DRONE POV: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE-CONE as it
          LAUNCHES its missile -- it ZOOMS toward the funeral gathering --
          The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before
          impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of
          running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand
          over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his
          mother's...

          We land on: "...whenever any form of government becomes
          destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to

          We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds --
          then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen:
          this is JERRY SHAW, 30, handsome, roguish. Somewhere between an
          adult and a child -- under his breath:

<b>           VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Now. Who are you gonna be?
           So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING
           CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from
          KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE
           game, CASH on the table.

<b>           JERRY KWAME

          A thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK:

<b>          BECKY
</b>          You know what would be great? If you
          guys took a longer break. That'd be
          awesome.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Hey, Becky? When're you going to start
          wearing makeup?
          Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry:

<b>          BECKY
</b>          .The collator's broken.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Dude: no its not.

</b>          (putting on a jacket)
          Oh yeah it is, dude!
          She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own
          smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson:

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Your first mistake? Underestimating

          I'm going to Cornell.
          And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever we are,
          this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your
          last night. You're gonna spend it
          collating.

<b>          KWAME
</b>          -- what? But she said the collator's
          broken.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          And that's why we have those rubber
          thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations
          on Cornell, though, that's huge!
          TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his
          NAMETAG: "JERRY." Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES.
          He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up:

<b>          JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you?
          The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets
          louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF:

<b>          INT. "EL" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING
</b>
          The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at
          their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS
          and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the
          train wall. A society lost in an "electronic elsewhere."
          And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good
          pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's
          got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage
          of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims:

<b>          SHEPARD SMITH
</b>          a heightened terror alert due to a
          series of suicide bombings, believed to
          be in retaliation for a deadly attack
          outside Abadan that killed forty people.
          Though the White House has denied
          involvement, Shia leaders have denounced
          the U.S. as responsible...

<b>          EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING

          An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM
          CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his
          attention: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS." He processes this a moment...
          his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT."

</b>          So where is girl? I don't see her?

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's
          over. She got smart.

<b>          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
</b>          Like the others.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've
          discovered.

<b>          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
</b>          You are like Johann.
          Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Your -- I'm like your dog?

<b>          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
</b>          Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But
          he believe... he is terrier. So is
          Labrador... but no labrador.
          Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:

<b>          JERRY
</b>          why do you think that is?
          As she pours a drink into a plastic cup --

<b>          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
</b>          Perhaps many things. When I rescue
          Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.

          (hands Jerry the cup)
          You need someone for rescuing you.
          Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit:

<b>          JERRY
</b>          This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight-
          thirty in the morning --

<b>          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
</b>          -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka.
          Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS.
          He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices.

<b>          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
</b>          Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are
          Labrador. Then ask if she give you money
          for rent.
          But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the
          phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly:

<b>          JERRY
</b>          its my mother.

<b>          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
</b>          Is problem?

<b>          INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT
          TO DO. Finally, he answers, as if ready for punishment:

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Hey, mom...
          Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is
          happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the
          floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain --

<b>          EXT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
          MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands.
          Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi.
          Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do
          is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally,
          from somewhere, strength. He walks forward.

          Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of
          the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he
          passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry
          BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN
          pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses --
          Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him--

<b>          JERRY
</b>          -- no! I-- I'm not him!
          All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken:

<b>          JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          It's okay! I'm not Paul!
          Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew.
          Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a
          lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN.
          Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body:
          And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that
          seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident.
          Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's
          identical twin. Off the surreal moment...
          A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's:

          THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, booming from a trumpet played by an 8 year-
          old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL
          HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but
          fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's
          knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a
          short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores:

          The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The

</b>          we need to get a new car --

<b>          KYLE
</b>          I like your car. We're gonna be late.
          The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows
          up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out:

</b>          No we're not: the bus.

</b>          -- are you kidding?

          Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling
          with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet
          case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)--

<b>          RACHEL

</b>          And your inhaler, which I may need to use

          They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse:

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          Yup -- that's what happens when you have
          a kid on lay-away.

          A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and

          A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the

          Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a

          Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances
          across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa.
          We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts.
          Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood.
          He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up
          there. So he does. We MOVE with him:

</b>          I'm trying, you know, just to --
          But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss.
          Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry
          hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again.
          And just then, William says, quietly, through tears:

<b>          WILLIAM
</b>          You sound just like him.
          Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And
          now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls
          back. Takes his wallet from his pocket:

          His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars.
          It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride
          to reject the offer? And the answer is...

          Jerry whips open his apartment door -- as far as he can: it's
          blocked by something. He reaches in, flips on the LIGHT: BOXES
          EVERYWHERE. Reeling, he picks one up, rips it open. Packing
          peanuts fly: a pair of night-vision binoculars. WHAT IS
          HAPPENING? Goes through more boxes in a flurry of CUTS:
           FALSE PASSPORTS; a POLICE SCANNER; BODY ARMOR; HAND GUNS; large
          BAGS OF FERTILIZER; strange CHEMICALS; 747 MANUALS. Jerry looks
          around, fear and confusion growing. His cell rings.,. startles
          him -- all the LCD says is: "ANSWER NOW."

<b>          JERRY
</b>          -- hello?
          A WOMAN'S VOICE. We can't place why... but it's really creepy.

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>          Look out your window. They're coming for
          you.

<b>          JERRY

          -- what? Who is this?

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>          Jerry. You have to run.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Who the hell is this?!
          Rips back the curtain to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP -- a flack-
          jacketed TEAM pours out, assault rifles ready. Jerry goes pale.

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>           Leave your residence. Get to the Mathis
          train station. You have 4 minutes.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Jesus Christ -- what's happening?!

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>          Run, or you'll be captured and convicted
          -- go NOW.
          CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE. Jerry whirls,
          goes out to the hall, hears THEM coming. Starts to run. But a

          Jerry sits cuffed to a table. Frightened, confused, on the
          defensive. The door opens and AGENT THOMAS MORGAN enters: 40s,
          born to the job, never smiles. Takes a seat, opens a "file:

<b>          JERRY

<b>          MORGAN
</b>          My condolences. I understand you've had
          a tough day.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          it hasn't been ideal.

<b>          MORGAN
</b>          Your brother worked for the State
          Department.
          This was almost a question. And while it's obviously news to
          us, Jerry clearly knew...

<b>          JERRY
</b>          You tell me.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Why? What am I doing here. I don't even

          Morgan tosses his black leather BADGE WALLET onto the metal
          table. It lands open with a substantial CLUNG!

<b>          MORGAN
</b>          Tom Morgan, Special Agent attached to the

          crossed out in red: "DECLARE WAR ON WAR!"

          Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd

          And with a smile he heads off. She watches him go -- dammit!
          really liking him in this moment. She watches longer than she
          should... then goes back to her work.

</b>          Excuse me? I would offer this whole
          situation isn't "obviously" about
          anything.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          Just think about it: you said your

          or whatever you're implying --

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Well hasn't that been the question my

          wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had
          been, he would've been the best fucking
          terrorist in history: he wouldn't have

          as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck,

</b>          That blast was the result of one single

          isotope that leaves no chemical markers --
          it's eighty times more powerful than C4.

</b>          Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency
          undetectable to the human ear. For this
          test we made it audible -- that was the
          tone you heard before the explosion --
          the tone was the trigger.

<b>          CALLISTER

</b>          Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I
          understand you're in a hurry, why don't I
          show you to your box.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          (WHAT THE FUCK?! then:)
          yes, thank you, we'd... like that.
          The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a
          THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly,
          waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of
          light, identifying him as: "SAXON, CARL." Jerry's eyes: this is
          madness. The elevator doors OPEN.

<b>          INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY
</b>
          They exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX.
          He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle
          Eastern Man gave Jerry:

<b>

</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>          MANAGER
</b>          Your key?
          Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box
          slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to
          give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          You gonna open it?

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Maybe it's not gonna be so bad.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          Yeah... maybe it's something good..
          They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO
          GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of
          the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: "EAR:MIC. NOW."

<b>           JERRY RACHEL
</b>          Oh, shit -- it's bad --
          They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear:

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC
</b>          Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In
          sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the
          adjacent vault carrying a briefcase.
          Take it -- by force if necessary -- then
          exit the building..
          Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know:

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          -- what?!

<b>          JERRY
</b>          -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier
          way to`get whatever the hell it is you
          want -- is there? Miss?
          But she's not answering.

<b>          JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Excellent.

          -- just take i t-- -- no! Jesus! I don't even
          let Kyle play with water guns!
          -- hey, I applaud your
          parenting skills -- take it!
          The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS
          COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC
          BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist -- the other spots Jerry's gun and
          REACTS, going for his gun:

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Don't!
          The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly --

<b>           JERRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the
           floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna
           hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just --
          we need the case.

<b>          COURIER #1

<b>          JERRY
</b>          I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do
          it.
          The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a
          combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his
          wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it... AND
          COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE -- SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun
          out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC
          falling out of his ear... he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under
          the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance:
          snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator --
          Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps
          up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel
          table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up
          GUN from his ankle -- brings the barrel up as:
          BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the
          gun that was kicked across the floor:

<b>          RACHEL
</b>
<b>          DROP THE GUN ASSHOLE!
</b>          Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip.
          Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother.

          The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO:

<b>          INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - ELEVATOR - DAY

          Alone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline
          coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle:

<b>          "01:12:36. 01:12:35."

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE

          JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:

</b>          Would you stop doing that?!

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>          There will thirty five seconds of

          TWO MORE BRINKS COURIERS wait by an armored truck. Jerry and

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Like you got into a fight. Me?

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          Like you lost one.
          AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel
          walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the
          stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR.
          SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing
          their weapons. Rachel tensing.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Just keep walking
          Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his
          shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR.
          Trying to stay calm.

<b>          JERRY (CONT'D)

          The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT
          JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING
          TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel--

          Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they

          sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2..

          in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them.
          Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them --
          Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards
          the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees
          them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door --

<b>          CHAUFFEUR
</b>          Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the
          game.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry --

<b>          CHAUFFEUR
</b>          I bet.
          Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he
          closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops
          and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we
          reveal, etched across the rear: "JUST MARRIED."

<b>          EXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY

          Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing
          madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY
          they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly
          as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each
          as tall and broad as the next --

          afternoon... afternoon, General...
          Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by
          ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders.

<b>          LATESHA (CONT'D)
</b>          Secretary Callister?
          He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID:

          And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling
          like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS:

<b>          LATESHA
</b>          Secretary Callister.
          Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by
          the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the
          GENERALS, planting herself in front of him:

          just had a meeting back there with more
          brass than the Navy Marching Band and
          with the terror threat rising every three
          hours, I'm going to just have to assume
          you're in the middle of a very delicate
          dance to stave off World War Three... so

          my thirty seconds and tell me what the
          hell B-36 is, or this world just fell
          into an even bigger heap of trouble.

          Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit
          a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO:

          Of course he was involved in some super

          everything that's taken place. Stop and look at each other. An
          awkward, high school beat. So... I guess this is it:

<b>          SCOTT
</b>          So...

<b>          LATESHA

          piece of paper. Hands it to him.

<b>          LATESHA
</b>          That's my address. I'm not using a cell
          phone anymore. Pick me up at eight.
          They smile at each other, Latesha's eyes catching a SURVEILLANCE

</b>
          Kyle's birthday party: streamers, other kids, cake, ad hoc
          soccer game. Rachel cutting pieces of cake when --

<b>          KYLE'S VOICE
</b>          Jerry!
          She turns to see JERRY standing there. He's still got his
          scratches, arm in a SLING. It's the only real injury we can see
          and it'll heal. Kyle runs up to him and throwing his arms
          around his waist.

<b>          JERRY
</b>          Hey, little man!
          Locks eyes with Rachel. Her heart beating like a drum, happier
          to see him then she'd ever imagine. And. Jerry holds up a
          present for Kyle.

<b>          JERRY (CONT'D).
</b>          Sorry I'm late, this was hard to find --
          Rachel's eyes well. She pulls it back. Manages to say:

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          Kyle. What do you say?

<b>          KYLE
</b>          I dunno, I haven't opened it yet.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          (rolls her eyes, grins)
          Who brought you up?
          Kyle rips open the present to find a brand new PLAYSTATION 3.

<b>          KYLE
</b>          They're on backorder everywhere! Mom --
          can I go play with it?

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          One hour. That's it...
          As Kyle tears off with his friends, Jerry walks over to her.
          It's like everyone else at the party has disappeared...

          Kyle turns on the TV, eagerly plugging in the Playstation -- we
          catch a snippet of the NEWS: CALLISTER being sworn in in front
          of a CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW COMMITTEE --

          Oblivious, Kyle flips on the video game and the screen CHANGES

          the screen fritzes and goes BLANK...

<b>          FRIENDS
</b>          Aw, what the hell?! It's broken!
          A prompt appears with a BLINKING CURSOR. Then... words scroll:

<b>          "HELLO, KYLE..."
</b>          The kids look at him, confused. Kind of freaked out. Kyle
          stares at the screen, eyes riveted, his breathing quickens.
