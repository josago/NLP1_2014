<b>   FADE IN:

   From an absolutely glistening WHITE ­ an image which first appears to be a
   brilliantly shining glass globe, and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid
   matter, less of a mystery. It's the

<b>   EXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) ­ DAY
</b>
1. FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned,
   spotless ­ a vision of small town normalcy and virtue.

   This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems
   to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to
   have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic.

   We hear a woman's voice:

                                 MARGARET (o.s.)
                          Carrie! Carrie

   The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue,
   which initially involves:

<b>2. STELLA HORAN ­ DAY
</b>
   An all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy
   white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun.

   The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body ­ luxuriant, taking it in
   inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming
   from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard.

<b>3. DOWNWARDS ANGLE ­ STELLA
</b>
   As she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half-
   grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door.

<b>                                VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                          What are those?
<b>                                                                                                    2

<b>4. STELLA'S POV ­ CARRIE WHITE
</b>
  A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-
  white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a
  pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella
  through the hedge.

<b>                                STELLA
</b>                         Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright.
                                (turning down the radio)
                         How long have you been there?

<b>                               CARRIE
</b>                               (not smiling; pointing with her finger)
                         What are those?

  Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing
  her breasts ­ white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit ­ not out of any particular
  modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.

<b>                                STELLA
</b>                         Those are my breasts, honey.

<b>                                STELLA
</b>                         You will. `Course you'll have to wait a
                         couple of years, but ­

                         No, I won't.

                   Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts?

<b>5    CARRIE
</b>    Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door.
    She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is:

<b>                                      CARRIE
</b>                   ...dirtypillows.

<b>                                 CARRIE
</b>               Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them
               `cuz she was bad when she made me.

<b>6   STELLA
</b>
    Incredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she
    too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge.

    She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off.

<b>                                   STELLA
</b>                           Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen ­ you must be real
                           hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and
                           get us some lemonade, would you like that?

<b>7   CARRIE
</b>
    Clearly torn ­ tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror ­ as if she expected the
    earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head.

<b>                                      STELLA
</b>                           C'mon.

                           It'll be our secret.

    Carrie ­ now really scared ­ shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge.
<b>                                                                                                    4

  And just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house.
  Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably
  MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets
  out a bloodcurdling scream:

<b>                            MARGARET
</b><b>                  CAARRIEETTAAA!!!
</b>
<b> 8 CARRIE, STELLA
</b>   Both frozen by this terrible sound

<b> 9 STELLA'S POV ­ CLOSER ON CARRIE
</b>
  As she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks
  quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she
  seems to smile ­ or is she about to cry?

  And then, she's gone ­ running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the
  White house as fast her legs can carry her.

<b>10. STELLA
</b>
  Stands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to do. It's utterly silent for a
  moment.

  And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White
  house ­ an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs
  that she's sorry, that she forgot.

<b>11. THE HORAN HOUSE
</b>
  As MRS. HORAN ­ in an old housedress with the hem falling down in the back ­ rushes out
  to answer to her daughter's call.

<b>12. THE WHITE HOUSE

  The sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot. Again, it should appear like a huge
  glass globe over which we counterpoint one mother/daughter dialogue with the less distinct
  babble of another:

                                  MARGARET (v.o.)

  Which continues over:

<b>13. TWO SHOT ­ STELLA AND MRS. HORAN

  Their eyes riveted on the house ­ trying, squinting to see through the sun's terrible glare.

                         The child...

  At this point, the hysteric babble reaches its crescendo; we should be able to pick out phrases
  in this cacophony as Margaret rants at Carrie to go into her closet and pray for forgiveness;
  as Carrie's frightened little voice proclaims that she forgot, that she's sorry. And then
  suddenly the screaming stops and it's quiet ­ dead quiet.

<b>14 THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
  As it becomes more distinct, visible. There's a low WHISTLING sound, and then what
  appears to be a stone the size of a small pebble lands on the roof.

  Another, slightly larger one appears a second or two later. And then another, and another,
  and...

<b>15 TIGHTER TWO SHOT ­ STELLA AND MRS. HORAN
</b>
  squinting, blinking at the pebbles which are coming down like marbles.

<b>16 THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
  as it's pelted with what are now even larger stones ­ WHISTLING, SCREAMING in the air
  like miniature bombs.

  Stones from a perfectly blue summer day.

  Stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs.

  One of them hits a downspout, knocking it onto the lawn. CRASHING, CRACKING
  SOUNDS as these pieces of granite tear into the stucco roofing, leaving holes.

  The effect is that of a drum being bombarded.

<b>17. TWO SHOT ­ MRS. HORAN AND STELLA
</b>
  Frozen to the spot: Mrs. Horan with her hands over her ears, her screams blending with the
  SOUND of larger and larger stones as they pelt the house and we hear Margaret throughout
  screaming:

<b>                                 MARGARET'S VOICE
</b>                          Stop that! Stop that!

  Stella is clutching Mrs. Horan like a child terrified by the freakiest of summer storms ­ a
  healthy young woman as her figure in the bikini testifies, but a child nonetheless, this
  nightmarish moment.

<b>18 THE HOUSE
</b>
  As still larger stones hail from the sky.

  And then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they started, they stop.

<b>19 TWO SHOT ­ THE WOMEN
</b>
  Mrs. Horan with her hands still over her ears, her daughter standing next to her, transfixed on
  the lawn. Once again, it's quiet.

<b>20 THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
  As one final stone ­ this one the size of a mere pebble ­ falls from the roof and plops onto
  the lawn.

  The image grows lighter and lighter. All the color seems to bleach out, turning the screen
  once again into an incredible, silently blazing white.

<b>  MAIN TITLES.
</b>
<b>21 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE ­ MORNING
</b>
  Now some years later ­ and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously. We see the
  front of the house as the door flies open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the
  doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs
  behind her.
<b>                                                                                                   8
</b>

  She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress ­ much too long, not so much out of style as utterly
  without style. What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we
  glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes.

  As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear:

<b>                                   MARGARET'S VOICE
</b>                         Carrie!

  Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house.

<b>                               CARRIE
</b>                         Yes, Momma.

</b>                         You come straight home from school.

  A moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but:

<b>                                CARRIE
</b>                                (sweetly)
                         I always do, Momma.

  Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening.

<b>22. EXT WHITE HOUSE ­ ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
  As Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk, in the course of
  which she passes by where the Horans used to live. Only the Horans no longer live here. No
  one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From
  the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago.

<b>23 EXT. TOWN STREETS ­ DAY
</b>
  Carrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her. The farther she gets from her
  house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out,
  an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest. And to help persuade us
  about this possibility, there is MUSIC.

</b>
  About five, BOBBY bikes on the other side of one of the streets, keeping pace with Carrie on
  a twenty-inch Schwinn with training wheels.

<b>27 FROMM'S POV ­ THE CLASS

  We will see, among others, Carrie.

  We also see TOMMY ROSS ­ a mid-seventies version of the boy next door. Good-looking,
  clean-cut, intelligent, athletic.

<b>28 FROMM
</b>
  He is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of puzzlement.

<b>                                  FROMM
</b>                         I must say ­ I must confess ­ this poem displays an extraordinary

                         ...a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross.

<b>29 THE CLASS
</b>
  All eyes are on Tommy, who doesn't seem very abashed. In fact, he turns, clasps his hands
  over his head, to the delight of his classmates. But you don't get the feeling he is a goof-off;
  he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it.

<b>30 FROMM
</b>
<b>                              FROMM

<b>31 THE CLASS
</b>
  The usual hesitation. Then Carrie's hand shoots up.

<b>32 FROMM
</b>
  He appears surprised to see Carrie, ordinarily shy, volunteering.

   Her volunteering has surprised her as well. But she's stuck with it. The eyes of the class are
   on her. And she has to say something. So she does.

<b> 34 FROMM
</b>
   He leaves his desk, moving into the class area, seeming to pounce on Carrie.

<b>                        FROMM
</b>                `Beautiful.' `Bee-t-ti-ful!' `Oh beautiful for spacious
                skies, for amber waves of grain.' Is that the beautiful you mean?

   The class is snickering. Carrie throws a despairing glance toward Tommy. Tommy looks at
   her, and away, embarrassed. Carrie looks down at her desk, almost burying herself.

<b>                        FROMM

                        (no one else)
                Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White
                          to say something!

   Tommy looks toward Carrie, with something suggesting compassion.
   Then he looks toward Fromm, and he is muttering something. Or to be specific:

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>                        (muttering)

<b>36 EXT. VOLLEYBALL COURT ­ DAY
</b>
 Two teams of girls, among them NORMA WATSON, HELEN SHYRES, CORA and
 RHONDA WILSON (sisters although not identical twins), CHRIS HARGENSEN and SUE
 SNELL. Supervising the game is MISS COLLINS wearing a warm-up suit and holding a
 whistle awaiting the next point. Among the girls is CARRIE anxiously watching for the ball
 to come her way. It has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily.
 When the shot begins, Miss Collins has just blown her whistle to announce:

<b>                       COLLINS
</b>                Okay, now. This is game point.

 This is the final point of the game and Rhonda Wilson is serving (she is on the opposite team
 as Carrie).

<b>                      RHONDA
</b>                      (giving the score)
                Twenty ­ Twenty.

 The ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley
 it back and forth over the net. And then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes
 over the net toward Carrie. It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her
 success. The little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier.

 The other girls are (AD LIB) shouting cautions and admonitions to Carrie. Carrie almost
 trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it.

 Carrie whacks the ball. She shacks it hard. And on a line ­ straight into the net.

 Another chorus of groans, with remarks like "Wouldn't you know!" and "Dumbo!"
 reinforcing them. Chris storms back toward Carrie.

<b>                      CHRIS
</b>                      (low, harsh)

<b>37 INT SHOWER ROOM ­ DAY
</b>
  Steam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler and cavort under individual
  showers. They banter little barbed pleasantries, bits of sexual information, family plaints,
  talk of college ­ all of which we hear from separate stalls.

  One by one the showers are turned off, the girls stepping out, removing pastel bathing caps,
  toweling, spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into. Steam hangs in the air.
  So do words, running into one another, tumbling, drifting.

  `...Tommy says he hated it on me... My sister's husband picks his nose... So does your
  sister... too cheap to spend a penny... we'll go after school... I'm going with Billy, we'll
  meet you... Friday night...'

  We PICK UP Miss Collins as she steps among the girls, spies Carrie still standing under the
  shower. She claps her hands together once, smartly.

<b>                          COLLINS
</b>                 What are you waiting for, Carrie?
                          (as Carrie looks at her)
                 Bell in five minutes.

<b>                          CARRIE
</b>                 Oh uh?

  As Collins departs, and the other girls start to move toward their lockers, Carrie is left alone
  in her shower stall. She is soaping herself. In a virtual reverie, she begins at her shoulders,
  moving her hands over her breasts in small, regular, virtually erotic circles. Her hand goes
  out of frame, below her stomach. Slowly, it emerges back into frame ­ full of blood. And
  just as she and we see this, so do the girls.

<b>                        CHRIS
</b>                 Peer-iod! Peer-iod!

  Carrie stares at her dumbly.

  The other girls are quick to take up the chant. Chris leads them.

<b>                        GIRLS
</b>                 Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod!

  One voice chimes in:

<b>                          NORMA

</b>
                Plug it up!

Others take up this new chant. For a while, like counterpoint, he chants overlap; then the
new chant emerges solely:

<b>                        GIRLS
</b>                Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!

Dime-sized drops are striking the tile floor at Carrie's feet.

<b>                       SUE
</b>                For God's sakes, Carrie, you got your period.
                       (as Carrie turns toward her)
                Clean yourself up!

Carrie seems bewildered.

<b>                       SUE
</b>                       (furiously)
                You're bleeding! You dumb pudding, you're bleeding!

Carrie looks down and wails, the sound is very loud.

A tampon strikes Carrie's chest, plops to her feet. Carrie just stares at it.

<b>                        NORMA
</b>                She thinks they're for lipstick.

Behind her, another girl pretends to throw up.

Shrieks of laughter. Another tampon strikes Carrie. Another. The girls are bombarding her
with tampons and sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken dispenser on
the wall. As they bombard Carrie:

<b>                        GIRLS
</b>                Plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up....

We isolate Sue Snell at the moment she joins in the chant, and watch her beginning to be
caught up in what can only be described as a fury.

Carrie howls and begins to back away, howling louder and louder.

The door is flung open by Collins.

<b>                        COLLINS

</b>
                What is this?

And she takes it in. She jerks the whistle to her mouth, blows and blows! The sound is
louder than a shriek (which it resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't).

And there is sudden silence.



<b>                       COLLINS
</b>                       (to girls)

The girls retreat, Sue last.

</b>                It must be her first...

<b>                        COLLINS
</b>                Out!

As the girls slip out, Collins turns to Carrie, who has backed up and is whimpering. Collins
slaps her face, not too hard at first, then with a flash of anger.

<b>                      CARRIE

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                I'm bleeding.

One blind searching hand comes up, clutches Collins' white shorts, leaving a bloody
handprint.

<b>                      COLLINS
</b>                Damn you!

She hurls Carrie part way across the room toward the broken sanitary napkin dispenser.

   There's a bright flash as a light BULB POIPS, fizzling out. Collins is surprised.

<b>                          COLLINS
</b>                   What...?

   And she looks at Carrie. Her anger seems to seep away. Her voice softens.

   Again, Carrie is shaking her head.

<b>                        MORTON
</b>                  We could call you a cab.

                  from gym for a week. Take study hall instead.

   Morton picks up the dismissal slip, hands it to Carrie.

<b>                         MORTON

                  That's not my name!

   Two things happen simultaneously; Morton recoils slightly and the ashtray quakes a little
   and then tumbles from the desk.

   Then Carrie goes out.

   Morton comes around the desk, stoops to pick up the ashtray, stares at it curiously for a
   moment, then looks at Collins.

   Okay, that's reality. He puts the ashtray back on the desk decisively, dismissing any
   "peculiar" thought he may have had.

  A quiet residential street in a lower middle-class neighborhood. Carrie is walking down the

  There comes Bobby Erbeter again on his bike, paralleling Carrie (as before)

  Screaming with anger (more than anything else) as he disentangles himself. He stands up,
 looks toward Carrie across the street, shakes his little fist.

  Eleanor frowns momentarily, leaves the kitchen.

  Through the middleclass, rather tasteful home, to the front door.

  Eleanor opens the door.

<b>67 ANGLE ON MARGARET WHITE
</b>
   Standing in the doorway. She is a large lady dressed in black, carrying a worn black leather
  sack, which we will discover is bulging with religious tracts.

<b>68 ELEANOR WITH MARGARET
</b>
  Margaret White is not a welcome visitor, but Eleanor Snell is a polite lady.

<b>                       ELEANOR

</b>
<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>               Sue is... fine.

 An impasse. Finally Eleanor feels constrained to open the door wider, put a smile on her
face, and:

<b>                     ELEANOR
</b>               Won't you come in, Mrs. White?

<b>                     MARGARET
</b>               Thank you.

She steps inside and Eleanor closes the door behind her, saying:

<b>                       ELEANOR
</b>               I think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.

Margaret is fishing tracts out of her bag.

Eleanor looks at the tracts with pretended interest

                 Children are godless these days, Mrs. Snell.

   Margaret's voice is almost toneless ­ now and throughout.

</b>                 My Sue is a good girl.

   Margaret doesn't sit, and Eleanor flees into the kitchen.

   As Eleanor reaches the phone.

   She hangs up, opens a drawer, takes out some hidden household money (a couple of bills),
  and drags herself back into the living room.

<b>70 INT. SNELL LIVING ROOM ­ DAY

   Margaret is still where we left her.

</b>                Thank you. I'll give you a receipt.

  Eleanor shifts from foot to foot while Margaret writes out the receipt, gives it to her.

<b>                      ELEANOR
</b>                Thank you, Mrs. White.

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                I'll pray you find Jesus before it's too late.

   What can one say? Eleanor stands there, completely exasperated but retaining her politeness
 like a steel, middle-class glove. She accompanies Margaret to the door and the latter leaves.
 Eleanor is about to close the door, stops, seeing:

<b>71 EXT SNELL HOUSE ­ FROM DOOR ­ DAY
</b>
  Sue is coming toward the door. She passes Margaret with a quick (inaudible) greeting and
 hurries to the front door where her mother is waiting.

<b>                       SUE
</b>                That's Carrie White's mother...

  As Eleanor nods and closes the door.

<b>                      SUE
</b>                      (apprehensively)
                What did she want?

                        (conspiratorial sigh)
                ...and I gave her a donation.

  Sue's face betrays relief, but Eleanor notices nothing.

</b>
<b>                        SUE
</b>                  Today? Like always.

    HOLD ON Sue, staring at the tracts on the table (or perhaps out the window as Margaret
   leaves). A long beat, then:

<b>                                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>72 CARRIE
</b>
    Who is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street.
   She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe ­ her plain dress and school books
   on the narrow bed.

    She is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of "Seventeen" ­ absorbed in the
   mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men.
   An escape of sorts.

   And we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe. It's
   decorated with just the fewest embellishments (i.e. high school pennant) that Margaret would
   allow in exchange for her own prices ­ a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an
   equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various
   religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall.

<b>73 ANGLE ­ FEATURING CARRIE
</b>
   Caught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick
   Madison Avenue mind. And then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears it's
   about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, Carrie glances out the window and down to
   see:

<b>74 EXT THE STREET ­ MARGARET
</b>
   As this formidable vision of black strides down the walk. Another woman like this would be
   coming home from a funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black.

<b>75 CLOSEUP ­ CARRIE
</b>
   Her heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier ­ a scared little girl
   now encased in the body of an adolescent.

   As she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat,
   Carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress. Then she begins to dress as we hear
   the SOUNDS of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea.
<b>                                                                                                  28
</b>
  And then the telephone RINGS ­ only to stop as Margaret picks up the receiver. It's just as
  Carrie dreaded ­ it's the school ­ and she stands by the door, trying desperately to overhear
  Margaret's muffled voice. And then Margaret hangs up, and in a deadly tone of voice ­ not
  yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity ­ she calls up the stairs:

<b>                        MARGARET'S VOICE
</b>                 I know you're listening. Come downstairs.

  And defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the:

<b>76 HALLWAY, STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, FOLLOWING CARRIE
</b>
  As she hurries down toward her mother and into:

<b>77 INT WHITE KITCHEN ­ DAY
</b>
  Where Margaret is standing by the stove, her back to her in stony silence.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Hello, Momma.

  No response. The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner, and in this altogether
  strange little kitchen ­ a veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art ­ Margaret is a rock.
<b>                                                                                                29
</b>
  Carrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame and the need to talk. Yet she
  recognizes her mother's wall of silence, knowing she won't speak until she's ready. They've
  been through this dance a thousand times. Finally, Carrie breaks.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                 Who was it that called?
                       (no response)
                 What did they say?

<b>78 MARGARET
</b>
  Point one and some grim satisfaction. Yet she doesn't respond immediately. Then she turns
  from the stove.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                        (softly)

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                 Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared...

  Margaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie. She puts on rimless glasses, then
  opens the Bible and starts to read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her
  face:

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                 `And God made Eve from the rib of Adam. And Eve was

  She pushes the Bible at Carrie, her finger on the place.

Margaret's hand flashes out, backhanding Carrie into the wall. It's a wallop of a slap, the
sting of it bringing tears to her eyes.

<b>                   CARRIE
</b>               Momma, please listen. It wasn't my fault.

Another backhanded blow knocks Carrie to the floor.

<b>                   CARRIE

The teakettle starts to WHISTLE.

Margaret clutches Carrie's wrist in a vise.

<b>                     MARGARET
</b>                     (heavenward)

               been tempted by the Antichrist. She may have committed the Sin of
               Lustful Thoughts.

The teakettle is WHISTLING louder ­ a high-pitched scream.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               No, Momma.

<b>                      MARGARET

Margaret flings open the door of the kitchen closet.

She switches on the light, and there is Jesus on the wall, rictus, crown of thorns, bathed in an
ominous blue light. A vision of a wrathful God. Throughout the following, Carrie struggles
desperately, but she's no match for her mother.

  She propels Carrie into the closet, slams the door behind her. Margaret's voice continues,
  overlapping onto:

<b>79 INT. CLOSET ­ CARRIE ­ DAY

  Very much the little girl now as she sinks to the floor of the closet ­ crying, disheveled,
  beaten. The closet is just what every child ever dreaded about the night.

  Looking down at Carrie.

  Falling on the shower floor.

  Surrounding Carrie, jeering her, bombarding her.

  In the forefront of the pack.

  MOVING IN SLOWLY on Tommy Ross' 1963 Ford, which is parked in the shadows on The
  Hill (something of a ridge which overlooks the town and is dedicated to Eros by high school
  students and occasional graduates). The MUSIC swells as we MOVE IN. And finally, we
  PEER into the car, where we see:

  Sue and Tommy have finished making love in the back seat. They are both putting their
  clothes in order, silently, slowly.

  Then they climb into the front seat. Sue takes out a cigarette. Tommy lights it with the
  dashboard lighter. They say nothing as Sue smokes for a few moments. Then Tommy looks
  at her closely.

How would you like to be Carrie White?

</b>How would I like to be Carrie White?

<b>       SUE
</b>How would you like to be Carrie White? How would you like to be
Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross... big man, big jock, popular.

<b>        TOMMY
</b>What's the big deal about being popular? I mean, one day I'll wake up
and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and
Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe
married with a bunch of kids...
        (stops)
What's that got to do with Carrie White? Or anything?

<b>        SUE
</b>I did something wrong and I feel bad about it.

</b>I can understand that. Hey, back in seventh grade, there was this kid...

I've got to do something about it.

Tommy moves back from Sue. He is looking at her, trying to figure her out. He wants to do
something, he doesn't want an argument, but...

<b>                     TOMMY

He stares off through the windshield. He is really puzzled. He steals a look at Sue. He starts
to put his arm around her; she moves a little, subtly but clearly. Tommy stares off into space
again.

<b>                       TOMMY
</b>               I never thought about her. I mean, she wasn't someone you had to

               She was always there ­ keeping to herself in that stupid dress ­ that

               You know what I mean?

Sue glances toward him. Of course she knows. And he is beginning to understand.

Tommy looks straight ahead again. He is starting to think. It's not all that easy.

<b>91 INT. WHITE LIVING ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
  Margaret is at the sewing machine. She is either listening to a reasonable facsimile of
  Kathryn Kuhlman preaching on the radio, or instead, to an old Victrola which plays
  Tennessee Ernie Ford's "Let the Lower Lights Be Burning." A Black Forest cuckoo clock,
  providing a sense of lapsed time.

  Suddenly the treadle on the sewing machine depresses itself. The needle begins to dip up and
  down; the bobbin whirs and jerks.

  Margaret turns around to see:

<b>92 CARRIE
</b>
  She is standing in the entrance of the living room. Her demeanor seems more peaceful, calm,
  almost too calm.

<b>93 MARGARET
</b>
  A touch of fear in her eyes. But:

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                  Go to bed.

<b>94 CARRIE

  She crosses over to her mother, kisses her lightly on the (unmoving) head.

  Carrie turns on a light. She undresses slowly, wearily. And then she stops and looks at
  herself in the mirror. A close, tired inspection. Her eyes seem hollow, haunted. Carrie
  doesn't like what she sees; she doesn't like herself.

  Flex. Slowly cracks appear in the mirror, spiderwebs.

  Flex. The mirror cracks wider.

  And flex: the mirror shatters, crashes to the dresser in pieces, loudly; some of the pieces fall
  on the floor.

<b>                        MARGARET

  A moment of utter panic ­ now what?

<b>98 HALLWAY STAIRS
</b>
  As Margaret strides up them, past the landing, and tries the knob on Carrie's door. It's
  locked. She rattles the knob. But to no avail. Then:

</b>                 Carrie! Carrie, open this door!

  Another beat; then:

</b>                         (sweetly)

  Margaret tries the knob again, and it is, indeed, open.

   Margaret peers around the room; she did hear a mirror break, no mistake about it. But there it
   is ­ whole again as her reflection in it testifies. Margaret walks over to it, rearranges the
   plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child on the dresser.

   She leaves the doorway and we return to Carrie, who smiles sweetly. And then:

   Flex.

   The door slams closed.

<b>                         COLLINS
</b>                  That would hit you where you live, now, wouldn't it? And you'd
                  deserve it ­ I don't think any of you have any idea of just how nasty
                  what you did was. The office has decided that you're to have one
                  week's detention.

   The girls sigh with relief. Chris has a particularly smug look. Collins takes in their reactions;
   then she reels in the line:

<b>                         COLLINS
</b>                  But. There's one little catch. It's to be my detention. Right here in
                  the gym. Fifty minutes every day. Get the picture?

</b>
   As they realize just how they've been had ­ indeed, getting the picture.

   Furious, defiant.

</b>                   That's up to you, Chris. That's up to all of you. Punishment for
                   skipping detention is three days' suspension and the loss of your
                   prom tickets. Any other thoughts?

    And then another, and another, and yet another flipping by us, one title following another as
    Carrie looms over the card catalog, searching. The title cards include POISON, POLITICS
    and POLTERGEISTS ­ on this latter card, it reads: "A ghost supposed to be responsible for
    table rappings and other mysterious, noisy disturbances." It also contains a cross-reference ­

   Sue is scared now ­ she hears it coming. There's no question about it, though; the rumbles

   Sue sits in the bleachers overlooking the field. She is preoccupied, still shaken by the
   afternoon's confrontation with Chris. The track team is moving past the bleachers (a coach in
   the field clocking them and shouting orders). Tommy, in his track uniform, peels away from
   the group and comes running up to Sue.

   To avoid the noise of the cheerleaders practicing down in front of them, and the other girls
   sitting in the bleachers half watching their boyfriends and half eyeing Tommy and Sue, Sue
   beckons Tommy to follow her away from the group behind the bleachers, and as they walk off
   together we hear the following:

   which belongs to the aforementioned BILLY NOLAN ­ a character whose life and brains
   stopped around the time he saw "Rebel" on television. He's Chris's boyfriend, and a huge
   cross swings around his neck. Right now, he's utterly amused by his harrowing driving, and
   turns to Chris who ignores him, still brooding over her afternoon losses. Billy takes a huge
   toke from a joint and hands it to her; she ignores that too, and proceeds to busy herself
   applying makeup in the visor window. So Billy looks out his window and strikes up some
   banter with a fellow cruiser idling beside them at the light. The light changes, and Billy peels
   out ­ an action with throws Chris backwards onto the seat.

He grabs her. She pushes; he grabs. A struggle. Grabs at her tit. There goes the blouse; the

again, and she responds. He goes at it. And she squirms away.

  Carrie is lying in bed, motionless, asleep.

  Margaret crosses the room quietly. She leans over the bed. On the table next to it is the

  No answer.

  Margaret bends over Carrie. And with surprising tenderness, she kisses Carrie's forehead.

  Carrie opens her eyes. She pulls a book out from under the covers; then she stares at the

he does:

</b>               Hey, Ross!

But Tommy ignores him in his singular pursuit.

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>               Hey, Carrie! Wait!

A couple of other students watch this ­ is this their Tommy Ross actually trying to speak with
Carrie? But he's oblivious of any looks now, any snickering ­ all he wants is to catch up with
Carrie.

Which he does; he manages to touch her arm, and it's a weird moment, this contact. She turns
around, her head painfully ducked down.

</b>                       (continuing)
               Hey, it's no big deal.

And she looks up and stares at him with that peculiar intensity that cuts through all the clamor
around them. Quiet, quietly:

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               Do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever?

A beat. Tommy stands there helpless, sensing just how much of a big deal it is. Seeing that
she's on the verge of tears, he's feeling even worse, and all he can say is:

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>               Sorry.

But it's too little, and too late. She's crying. And what's more, she's gone ­ swallowed up
into the clamor of students rushing to beat the bell. Which RINGS as we:

  As Collins tidies up after one of the classes ­ throwing towels into huge cans, etc. Only to
  hear a mewing, whimpering sound and come upon Carrie who's huddled in one of the dark
  corners of the room, crying. It's almost as if she created her own closet of space.

remains on the porch side of the screen door, he catches glimpses of the weird house within.

</b>
    The sun is shining ­ perhaps the next day, a day later. The house is a picture postcard ­ under
    it, we hear the sweet, muffled sound of "Amazing Grace." It's just loud enough for us to hear
    it ­ joyous, triumphant.

</b>
    Margaret sits beneath the plaster crucifix.

    The sampler, however, sits in her lap ­ unfinished, unminded. She's virtually catatonic.

    "Amazing Grace" ­ a sweet, contemporary rendition ­ is on the Webcor. A pleasure after
    Kathryn Kuhlman.

    Carrie sits at the sewing machine, finishing work on the pattern for her prom dress. She
    removes the material from the sewing machine, which we now see is a lush crushed velvet.

    The cuckoo clock is TICKING, TICKING.

    Carrie stares at Margaret, then turns the sewing machine off. She looks back at Margaret,
    then turns her attention to the machine, her eyes sparkling.

    Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine depresses itself.

    The needle starts to bob up and down, up and down, up and down... WHIRRING, jerking.

    The side wheel spins. And then stops.

    She smiles. Then rises and goes to start up the stairs to her room.

    Margaret looks after her. Hate. And fear.

   Very dark, shadowy, deserted. The night before the prom. Silence, then a SCRAPING sound
   of a:

<b>162 WINDOW
</b>
   Being jimmied open. Behind the thick glass, we see a face ­ just whose isn't clear yet. The
   slip-lock comes free, the sill is being pushed up, and Billy's head appears. Chris is right
   behind him.

<b>163 LONG SHOT ­ THE GYM
</b>
   As a flashlight is shined upwards ­ at the criss-crossing girders sheathed in crepe paper; at
   banks of lights which will later be used to shine down and highlight two areas in particular ­
   the huge wall mural and the chalked-in spot where the King and Queen of the Prom will be
   crowned.

<b> 164 TWO SHOT ­ BILLY AND CHRIS
</b>
   DOLLYING right behind them as they proceed toward the stage area ­ past the numerous
   tables set up for the prom-goers, past the twin bandstands. Billy is carrying the ice chest,
   Chris the flashlight.

<b> 165 ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
   As they arrive behind the stage. Billy puts the chest down and takes out a pair of Playtex
   rubber gloves, snaps them on. Then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine.

<b>166 CHRIS' POV ­ BILLY
</b>
   Looking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer, climbing a ladder which takes him up to a
   narrow platform overlooking the stage area.

   Shining the flashlight to guide Billy, her face flushed with excitement.

unable to see him, suddenly feeling very alone.

                       (no answer; genuinely scared)
               Billy!

And just at that moment, a piece of crepe paper floats into the FRAME and lands in Chris's
hair. She jumps, utterly unnerved. She looks up to see Billy staring down at her from the
platform, grinning.

  CUTTING between the final arrangements for the prom itself and Carrie's preparations as the
  night approaches. The emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, although this montage ­
  scored throughout with happier and happier MUSIC ­ will also feature some of our lesser
  characters.

  Among other things, we will see:

             A) THE GYM ­ as last-minute arrangements are made ­ more crepe paper hung,
         party favors put on tables, etc.;

             B) CARRIE ­ in a town store as she shops for makeup;

            C) NORMA WATSON ­ under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a
         manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted;

             D) TOMMY ­ picking out Carrie's corsage at the florist;

             E) CARRIE ­ at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't
         see), a happy look on her face;

            F) THE GYM ­ as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage

             G) SUE ­ having dinner with her parents

            H) THE TWINS ­ in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on
         enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously;

            I) ERNEST ­ the class president ­ making sure the microphone on the stage
         works;

             J) THE BAND ­ among them, The Beak, setting up;

             K) SANDRA STENCHFELD, practicing her fabulous twirling baton act;

            L) A DOOR ­ which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them
         several inches taller than their depressed-looking dates;

<b>171 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
  Carrie sits in front of that same mirror, but this time, there's a different attitude. And a
  different girl, which pleases her. She looks different, very different, from before. She's
  dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress, but the SHOT is ANGLED in such a way
  that we don't see it. In any case, it is not prim. She is wearing some makeup. She looks...
  well, there has been a transformation.

  In the background, the door is opened by Margaret.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                 Come in, Momma.

  Margaret advances into the room.

  Carrie opens a florist box and takes out a lovely corsage of tiny tea roses.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                 Do you want to pin it on, Momma?

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                 I can see your dirtypillows. Everyone will.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Breasts, Momma, breasts. Every woman has them.

  Carrie's voice is calm; nothing, not even Margaret, will spoil tonight, and ever so slightly, this
  scene ­ and all that follow for a considerable period of time ­ has an edge of unreality to it.
  It's all been diffused a bit ­ a fairy tale through Carrie's eyes. What would look bad or tacky
  looks acceptable; what looked good before now looks spectacular.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                 Take off that dress.

<b>                         CARRIE

The Black Forest CUCKOO CLOCK sings out downstairs. It's eight o'clock.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               Stop it, Momma. I'm nervous enough.

Margaret reaches up and pinches her cheek hard, leaving a red mark. She looks toward
Carrie.

Carrie is pinning the tea roses on herself.

Margaret hooks her right hand into a claw, rips at her cheek, leaving a thin line of blood.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>               Stop hurting yourself, Momma. That's not going to stop me either.

Margaret strikes herself in the mouth with her fist.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               Go away, Momma.

<b>                     MARGARET

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>               No. It'll be okay.

Bur she's rattled, and nervously starts moving around a series of objects in the room.
Cosmetics on the bureau, the florist box, the glow-in-the-dark statue. But it's sheer will at
this point. It's after eight, and there's no sign of Tommy.

<b>                       MARGARET
</b>               It's not too late. You can stay here with me.

  Margaret is pushed back on the bed. Horrified, she rises again.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                 `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'

  The words stop. But Margaret's eyes are fixed on Carrie, as Carrie leans toward her. Carrie's
  voice is soft and compassionate.

<b>                         CARRIE
</b>                 You'll say nothing, Momma. You are going to have to learn that
                 I'm not like you, not anymore.

  The BUZZER downstairs sounds. Carrie goes to her window and sees:

  at the front door, the overhead light shining on his hair, making it glisten. He looks very
  handsome.

  She goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap; then, to Margaret:

</b>                 I'll be home early, Momma.

  Carrie who opens the door.

   Down the stairs, through the dining room, into the kitchen. Almost the same path that Carrie
   trod, but trod so differently. While Carrie's pace had been light, nervously expectant,
   Margaret's is slow and heavy.

   Margaret crosses to one of the drawers.

   She reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams in the light.

   The school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the Prom; cars are pulling in, among them,
   Tommy's Ford.

<b>184 INT. TOMMY'S CAR
</b>
   as Tommy turns off the ignition. Carrie's staring at the other couples getting out of their cars.
   Tommy watches her taking it all in.

<b>                           CARRIE
</b>                  It's like a dream.

   She turns to him and realizes he's teasing her.

<b>                          CARRIE
</b>                  Easier said than done.

                  Can we sit here another minute?

   Tommy laughs and nods. A moment of silence. Carrie is miserable ­ she's happy to be with
   Tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard. It's like getting up to dance the first
   time. Perhaps it would be better to sit this one out.

<b>                          TOMMY

                  Don't be nervous. Besides...
                          (a little self-mocking)
                  I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself.

   And that's just enough ­ he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh.

<b>185 INT. GYM

   where the prom is already under way, the band PLAYING an energetic version of "Harlem
   Nocturne." From Carrie's POV it's all magic ­ explosions of pastel color, everyone looking
   like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness.

   Carrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in
   as Tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door. As Carrie stares at the giant mural on the
   stage wall ­ full of celestial moon, stars and rockets ­ a VOICE bellows out behind her.

<b>186 GEORGE DAWSON

  The source of the salutation and Tommy's best friend. He bounds INTO FRAME, wearing a
  T-shirt with a painted black tie under his dinner jacket. His girlfriend, Frieda Jason, tags
  behind.

                  asked you instead of Frieda.

  The two boys immediately go into a mock fight. Frieda comes up to Carrie.

</b>                  Don't let it bother you. If they destroy each other, I'll dance with you.

  Carrie smiles back at her nervously; there's an awkward silence.

</b>                  Hey, where'd you buy your dress? I love it.

<b>                         CARRIE
</b>                  No shit.

  Frieda laughs; so does Carrie, and the tension eases up. Behind them, Tommy keeps one eye
  on Carrie. He shrugs ­ it's working, goddammit ­ and he stuffs his hands into his dinner
  jacket.

          and launch into an oldie-but-goodie. On drums ­ The Beak himself.
              B) THE TWINS ­ CORA AND RHONDA ­ dressed identically, dancing with
              C) ERNEST PETERSON, the black class president, is wonderfully officious as he
          gets the evening's first entertainment organized. It (or she) is ­
              D) SANDRA STENCHFIELD and her fabulous twirling baton act, a phenomenon
          to the lilting STRAINS of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head."
              E) NORMA is off in a corner, bending another girl's ear; STAN is standing idly
          by, pretending to be invisible.
              F) MORTON, FROMM and the other chaperones including MISS FISH look for
          something to do, for someone who's stepping out of line. And find it. In the person of
          FREDDY DE LOIS, who's guzzling the punch.
              G) TOMMY and CARRIE sit at their table next to GEORGE and FRIEDA.
          Tommy lights a candle.

Carrie turns around and finds herself facing Collins ­ dressed up, looking more like one of the
students than a teacher.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               You look very pretty, Miss Collins.

Carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her. They're virtually alone at this
moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied.

               But it's over with. It's over.

Collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's eyes follow hers. At this particular
moment, the band is PLAYING a quiet number ­ slow, romantic.

<b>                      COLLINS
</b>               I remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I
               went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed
               with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never
               had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you?

<b>                       CARRIE

And then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly.

  He has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out onto the floor. He is a young man
  of considerable confidence ­ the best part of his popularity ­ and it's a contagious trait.
  Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less
  awkwardly, begins to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her
  freedom.

<b>190 A CORNER OF THE GYM
</b>
  Tommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit breathless and very happy. For some
  moments, Tommy keeps his arms around Carrie, looking at her. And then he leans forward,
  about to kiss her, impulsively. And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back. And is
  immediately embarrassed.

<b>                          TOMMY

</b>               No harm, no foul.

They stand there for a couple of seconds.

And suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy. It's a quick, awkward, frightened kiss. A
bird peck.

And again they stand there, until:

<b>                       CARRIE

And he kisses her. She breaks, looking up at him.

He pauses; he's on the edge. And steps back.

She's puzzled. And she's about to ask something else.

  She laughs aloud ­ the sound of her own laughter is so foreign to her that she claps a hand
  over her mouth, at her own daring. She takes the pencil and quickly circles their names ­ so
  quickly that the pencil breaks, bringing a small drop of blood to her finger. She gasps.

   The band launches into a rock version of "Pomp and Circumstance."

   Ushers appear at Tommy and Carrie's table. George is pounding Tommy's back. An
   aluminum foil scepter is thrust into Tommy's hand; a robe with a fur collar is thrust over
   Carrie's shoulders.

<b>215 SUE ­ STAGE WINGS
</b>
   Peering out farther to get a good look. Unseen at first by her, there's a cord on the edge of the
<b>   FRAME.
</b>
<b>216 MORTON
</b>
   Blocked by the clamor of the students, he's unable to make a straight bee-line for Sue in the
   wings. So he takes the long way around ­ back behind the stage...

<b>217 TOMMY AND CARRIE
</b>
   Dollying as they're led down the center aisle; past a blur of smiling faces, the APPLAUSE
   SWELLING. They're being led toward the stage area ­ the thrones waiting for them. The
   lights get brighter; the MUSIC gets louder.

<b>218 THE BANDSTAND
</b>
   As they pass by. The Beak winds conspiratorially at Carrie.

<b>219 THE STAGE
</b>
   as Tommy gives Carrie his hand, helping her up the steps, over tangles of black power cables.

<b>220 BENEATH THE STAGE
</b>
   Where we finally reveal just where Chris and Billy have been hiding all this time. Chris
   listens to the footsteps (of Carrie and Tommy) coming overhead; grasping the cord that Billy
   has hooked up, holding it very tightly...
<b>                                                                                                 106

<b>221 CARRIE AND TOMMY
</b>
   as they're helped into the massive thrones; behind them is the huge mural of stars and ships.

<b>222 ERNEST
</b>
   the showman now, P.T. Barnum in all of his expansiveness.

<b>223 SUE
</b>
   In the wings, watching this action. In the corner of the FRAME, the cord we glimpsed earlier
   ­ the same one which Chris clutched beneath the stage ­ jiggles, and Sue notices it move.
   She traces its path with her eyes, seeing that it goes up to:

<b>224 A BANK OF LIGHTS
</b>
   Concealing a single silver bucket; meanwhile:

<b>225 CARRIE
</b>
   Staring down at the gym floor; the lights are searing ­ so hot and bright that it's impossible to
   see clearly, and a new set of spotlights being shone on Tommy and her only makes it harder.

<b>226 ANOTHER ANGLE ­ CARRIE
</b>
   as a piece of crepe paper lands in her hair...

<b>227 THE STUDENTS
</b>
   A sea of faces, the spectrum of reactions.

</b>
   spreading his arms; a politician.

</b>
<b>229 SUE IN THE WINGS
</b>
   The implications of the cord and bucket positioned over the throne just starting to dawn on
   her as everyone begins singing the school song:

                           ALL (o.s.)
                  All rise for the John F. Kennedy Hiyyyyh...

   And a hand comes into FRAME, clutching Sue's wrist. It belongs to:

<b>                        MORTON
</b>                  What're you doing here, young lady?

</b>
   From the throne, she sees Sue ­ and Morton and he pulls her toward the back exit.

   Chris is almost hyperventilating as the school song continues.

<b>232 CARRIE'S POV ­ SUE
</b>
   As Morton firmly pushes Sue out the rear gym door. The door shuts, and as it closes:

</b>
   Confused, wondering what's happening in the glare of lights and noise...
<b>                                                                                                108

   locked out by Morton, trying to get back in. The door won't open. She debates going to try

   as the song reaches its crescendo:

   Chris shudders involuntarily at the mention of this nickname. She violently jerks the cord
   with both hands, yanking it. A sound ­ half-scream, half-moan ­ comes from her mouth,
   overlapping into:

<b>237 THE STEEL BUCKET
</b>
   high above the stage, slowly tipping over, the blood pouring from it.

   almost proscenium-like in this FRAMING, from all the way in the back of the gym.

   Carrie and Tommy sit on their huge thrones as the buckets above them deposit their contents
   on top of them.

   The blood splashing down...

<b>240 THE MURAL

   As more blood splatters them in their white dinner jackets, the MUSIC halting.

<b>245 INT. GYM ­ THE STUDENTS
</b>
   As the singing stops, the students staring at the stage.

<b>246 CARRIE
</b>
   Her eyes tightly clenched shut, looking as if she's been dipped in a bucket of red paint. She's
   gotten the worst of it.

<b>247 THE BUCKET
</b>
   dangling on the pulleys over the throne, clanging back and forth. A high-pitched GIRL'S
<b>   VOICE SCREAMS.
</b>
<b>248 TOMMY
</b>
   Splattered with blood. Below them, the sounds of hysteria begin ("My God, that's blood!")
   Tommy starts toward Carrie just as:

</b>
<b> 249 ANOTHER ANGLE ­ STAGE ­ FEATURING TOMMY

    As the bucket falls and hits Tommy on the head; it knocks him unconscious, and he slumps to
    the floor.

<b> 250 THE STUDENTS ­ FEATURING HELEN SHYRES
</b>
    Watching this in pure horror. She starts to giggle uncontrollably, the kind of hysterical laugh
    that comes out of pure terror. It overlaps onto:

</b>
    As the hysteria begins to spread.

<b> 252 CARRIE
</b>
    as she starts toward the unconscious Tommy.

</b>
    as more of them start laughing... the sound of it becoming contagious.

<b> 254 CARRIE
</b>
    hearing the dreaded laughter.

<b> 255 CARRIE'S POV ­ THE STUDENTS
</b>
    Through the harsh glare of the lights ­ laughing, pointing (see Norma Watson), doubling up in
    hysteria, utterly out of control.

    Laughing...

   As Carrie makes her way to the stairs, tripping over the black power cords. A horrified
   Collins is on her way up the stairs.

</b>                   Oh, Carrie ­ let me help you.

   Carrie hesitates at the sight of the teacher. But it's too late for help, and in the fastest flex
   we've seen to date, she jerks her head and Collins bounces backward ­ down the stairs,
   slamming into a wall.

<b>259 THE STUDENTS
</b>
   Laughing harder now, unable to stop.

<b>260 THE GYM ­ ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
   Where all is pandemonium.

   Morton makes his way to Collins, giving her his handkerchief; she has a bloody nose.

</b>
   Tears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she takes in the sight of her
   tormentors.

<b>262 THE GYM ­ YET ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
   Helen Shyres is still laughing so hard that she's about to throw up or go into shock.

   George Dawson has climbed on the stage and is hunched over the slumped figure of Tommy
   Ross, examining him.

<b>                           GEORGE
</b>                   Call a doctor! Hey, call a doctor, quick!

   He tries to pick Tommy up, and in the process the throne topples over on the stage.

   Frantic, rushing back into the school and down the hall toward the prom doors.

</b>
<b>264 CARRIE
</b>
   Takes a deep breath, mustering her energy. She closes her eyes and sees:

<b>265 THE GYM DOORS ­ THREE SETS OF DOUBLE DOORS
</b>
   All of them open, a few students milling around them as...

<b>266 CARRIE
</b>
   Closes her eyes even tighter and flexes. And ­ in SWISH PANS:

<b>267 THE DOORS
</b>
   slam shut. In the process, several things are accomplished at once. The prom-goers are
   trapped inside, and one or two of them get their hands or legs caught in the doors as they
   close, screaming with surprise and pain.

<b>268 INT. HALL ­ SUE
</b>
   who once again was just a little late, arriving just as the DOORS SLAMMED SHUT; she sees
   the screaming prom-goers unlucky enough to have been caught in the doors.

<b>269 INT. GYM
</b>
   Utter pandemonium as students rush toward the doors.

<b>270 THE BEAK
</b>
   Near the bandstand area, looking up at the stage and realizing that it's Carrie who's
   responsible for closing the doors.

<b>                          THE BEAK
</b>                  It's Carrie! It's Carrie!

   Fromm starts heading toward the stage to get control of the microphone, to stop the panic.

   The kids continue rushing toward the closed doors.

<b>271 CARRIE
</b>
   A small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one responsible, the one with the power
   now. It's not what she wanted, but it no longer matters. They're going to know her now and
   never forget her.

<b> 273 CARRIE
</b>
    Seeing the hose, getting the idea... NOTE: SPLIT SCREENS begin here.

<b> 274 CLOSER
</b>
    as her eyes narrow and focus on the hose, zeroing on it.

<b> 275 THE HOSE
</b>
    As it starts to unwind, to unspiral into the air, starting to spray a burst of water.

<b> 276 THE HOSE ­ ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
    As it becomes snake-like, water springing from the nozzle.

<b> 277 THE STUDENTS
</b>
    Cries of surprise as it begins to spray water on them, ruining their clothes.

<b> 278 THE HOSE
</b>
    As the velocity of the water increases, stronger and stronger.

<b> 279 CARRIE
</b>
    Eyes gleaming, a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and surveys ­

<b> 280 THE STUDENTS
</b>
    Like rats in a maze ­ a slapstick chaos as they try to get away from the animated hose. The
    water forces the students back from the doors, backwards toward the stage.

<b>281 CARRIE
</b>
   A smile of satisfaction. For the first time, she's showing them ­ they're the ones being made
   to look foolish. She's standing on one side of the stage.

<b>283 ERNEST
</b>
   Level-headed to the end, making his way through the pandemonium toward the stage area and
   the bandstand as fast as he can...

<b>284 CARRIE
</b>
   Still controlling the hose, she spots Ernest, seeing him move toward the stage area.

<b>285 TRACKING ­ ERNEST
</b>
   knowing somehow ­ with some sixth sense ­ that Carrie's watching him. He feverishly
   hurries toward the area where the band equipment is plugged in... where the high voltage
   cables are hooked up to the electrical current.

   Behind him, Fromm has reached the microphone and is trying to be heard, telling everyone to
   remain calm.

<b>286 CARRIE
</b>
   Realizing just what Ernest plans to do:

<b>287 ERNEST
</b>
   Is flung invisibly and forcibly away from the area by Carrie's will.

<b>288 FROMM
</b>
   Big belly and all, trying to steady the mike. He puts his hand on it. The water, however, has
   reached him, and just as he touches the mic, he's electrocuted ­ his arm bursting into flame,
   unable to let go as his body goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a fish on
   land.

</b>
   Watching this; another flex, and:

<b>290 FROMM
</b>
   Is propelled backwards from the microphone; he falls backward into the cyc, his flaming arm
   igniting it. A celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames. It prevents any of the students
   from using the back exit.

</b>
   Watching, riveted with horror, some of them screaming, others frozen to the spot as the cyc

<b>299 CEILING POV
</b>
   Collins and Ernest directly below the path of the lighting bar. We see the flaming cyc on the
   stage collapse forward. The light bar begins to shake. Plaster drops, and the light bar DROPS
   ­ just short of Collins' head ­ as far as its wires carry it.

</b>
   Watching all this ­ a giggle (or is it a sob?) emerging from deep within her.

   Another flex.

<b>301 THE LIGHT BAR

   starts to swing recklessly around the gym. Back and forth, back and forth ­ it hits the ceiling,
   igniting it and the decorations. Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling.

<b>302 BENEATH THE STAGE ­ CHRIS AND BILLY
</b>
   seeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the light bar.

   The back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the outside, and which the cyc flames
   prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to) is now free, and Billy and Chris see
   their chance to escape. They burst out from under the stage as:

<b>303 CARRIE
</b>
   Spots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late.
   They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do.

<b>304 THE GYM ­ FEATURING THE LIGHT BAR
</b>
   As it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually whipping this screaming girl in her
   green chiffon dress back into a wall.

   Helen Shyres is backed into a corner, giggling with horror, in shock, utterly hysterical.

   Students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on
   the windows so they can escape.

   Morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows. All this
   to no avail. End SPLIT SCREEN.

   fire collapse behind her.

   She passes Sue in the hall who's sobbing hysterically. And as Carrie exits, Sue runs into this
   inferno of fire to find Tommy. And then the town WHISTLE BLOWS... and BLOWS. It

<b>309 EXT. TOWN STREETS ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie's on her way home. At this point, she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly
   car accident; wet, caked with blood, eyes glistening madly, almost shapeless. She goes down
   a hill, and then, from:

<b>310 ANOTHER ANGLE ­ THE HILL ­ NIGHT
</b>
   as a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie. And then shortly afterward, out of
   nowhere, Billy's Chevy ­ it's headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right for her.

   Turns around and sees it coming toward her.

   As the Chevy heads right for her, standing in the headlights in its path, bloated, swaying back
   and forth, her arms thrown out.

<b>314 THE CHEVY
</b>
   Almost right on top of her...

<b>315 CARRIE
</b>
   Flexing, averting the car just as it almost smacks into her. It just misses her.

<b>316 INT. THE CHEVY

   Billy is livid, turning around to see Carrie in the back window.

   But the car is headed for an embankment. Billy realizes this and starts pumping the brakes.
   But the car's accelerating, not responding to Billy's efforts to slow it down.

<b>317 CARRIE
</b>
   Her head pounding, flexing.

<b>318 INT. CHEVY
</b>
   As Billy attempts to turn the wheel; it, too, has turned traitor ­ it won't turn.

   They're heading right for the embankment. Billy's eyes are bugging out, Chris is screaming
   as:

<b>319 THE CHEVY
</b>
   Plows smack into the embankment and rolls over several times. It then bursts into a sheet of
   flames.

</b>
   Watching this explosion turn into a conflagration. We see the fire reflected in her puffy,
   exhausted face ­ brighter and brighter as we HEAR the sound of the WHISTLE merging with
   SOUND OF SIRENS, and:

<b>                                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>321 EXT WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
   The house is totally dark. Not even a porch light. In the distance, perhaps, the glow from the
   burning gymnasium.

   A figure is moving toward the house.

   It is Carrie.

<b>322 AT DOOR
</b>
   Carrie tries the front door. It is unlocked. She opens it partially.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                       (small voice)

   She opens the door wider.

</b>                       (louder)

   Silence. Carrie steps inside.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                       (louder)
                   Momma, I'm home.

   Silence.

   Carrie closes the front door.

<b>323 INT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
   With the closing of the door, Carrie turns on a light. She looks around. The house is
   ominously empty, ominously still.
<b>                                                                                                   120

<b>                       CARRIE
</b><b>                   MOMMA!
</b>
   Silence floods back in.

   Carrie moves to the foot of the stairs, turning on lights as she goes. She mounts the stairs,
   goes along the narrow hallway to her room.

<b>324 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie turns on the lights, closes the door.

   She stares at the Madonna-child figurine on the bureau.

   Then, slowly, she removes her blood-stained clothing, letting it lie in a heap.

   Clutching a robe, she goes into the bathroom.

<b>325 INT. BATHROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie turns on the shower, waits for it to get hot. It is almost steaming as she steps in.

   Very carefully, Carrie scrubs herself clean.

   Then she steps out of the shower, dries herself off briefly, puts on her robe, and turns off the
   bathroom light. What's important here is this gives us time to breathe, to focus on Carrie.

<b>326 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie returns to her room. She is clean now; her wet hair hangs. A feeling of despair about
   her or perhaps she is emptied out.

   Carrie almost mouths:

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                   Momma...

   It is a little child's voice and there is no answer.

   She goes out into the hallway.

<b>327 INT. HALLWAY ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie goes to the head of the stairs. Once again, she mouths the words:
<b>                                                                                            121
</b>
<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                  Momma...

   Something ­ a movement? An instinct? -- makes her turn. She sees:

<b>328 MARGARET
</b>
   Coming toward her.

<b>329 CARRIE
</b>
   She flings out her arms and cries out:

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                  Oh, Momma!

   And throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement from Margaret, a quick
   movement, hard to define. And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach.

   Briefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand.

   Then Carrie tumbles down the stairs.

<b>330 ANGLE DOWN STAIRS
</b>
   On Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs.

<b>331 MARGARET
</b>
   Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.

<b>   MARGARET
</b>   It says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'

<b>332 CARRIE
</b>
   Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted. She begins to crawl
   backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the
   stairs.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                  And now the devil has come home.
<b>                                                                                                122

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                      (whimpering)
                  Momma, it's not right.

   Carrie starts crawling to the kitchen.

<b>333 INT. KITCHEN ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen,
   just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of
   the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while.

   Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut.

   Margaret is coming toward the kitchen.

   Carrie flexes again ­ to hold the door shut.

   But it's no use ­ Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. She raises the knife and
   starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>                  I should have killed you when you were born.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                  Momma, I love you. Please help me!

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                  Sin never dies.

   There's nothing else to be done. Carrie flexes, and a serving fork ­ dangling from a hook on
   the way ­ suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret. It is followed by another and
   another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret.

   Margaret collapses.

   Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother.

   And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling
   her screams.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                  You. You tricked me.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Get out.

And then something hits the roof, rattling. A small sound. A stone.

Then another.

Then a third.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Get out! Get out!

The stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail.

Sue is rooted to the spot, terrified.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Get out, get out, get out!

The stones are coming down harder. All sound as one or two of them break through the roof,
rattle on the floor below.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b><b>                 GET OUT!
</b>
A stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen.

Carrie flexes.

And Sue stumbles backwards toward the door.

Flex.

Sue is whipped around, as though by a great wind.
<b>                                                                                                124

     Stones are crashing on the house.

     Sue is hurtled out of the house.

<b>  334 INT. KITCHEN
</b>
     As a couple of larger stones crash into the room, Carrie heads for the closet.

<b>  335 EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
     Sue, rising from the ground, see stones crashing into the house.

     She begins to run away.

<b>  336 INT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
     Carrie walks toward the closet; the figure of Jesus is illuminated ­ welcoming her? She goes
     into the closet.

     She closes the door.

     Stones crash down, obliterating the scene.

<b>  337 EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
     Sue stops running. She turns to look at the White house.

<b>  338 WHITE HOUSE ­ SUE'S POV
</b>
     The stones are flattening the house. The house is being pounded into the ground.

<b>  339 SUE
</b>
     Terror and disbelief. Nightmare.

<b>  340 THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
     The rain of stones stops.

     Silence.

     Then the house begins to sink ­ slowly, slowly, slowly ­ into the ground.

   And the ground is swallowing up the house.

   And covering it until ­ nothing remains. Not a trace.

<b>341 EXT. SNELL HOUSE ­ DAY
</b>
   Some time later ­ a week, perhaps two weeks after the nightmares of Prom Night.

<b>342 INT. SNELL HOUSE
</b>
   A home in the course of losing its family. White sheets cover furniture. Boxes in the midst of
   being packed.

   Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving. She
   sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons. And she
   comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret White, forgotten until now. They
   have a momentary hypnotic effect on her.

   The phone RINGS, startling her. She rushes to answer it in the kitchen, catching it on the first
   or second ring.

<b>                          ELEANOR
</b>                          (hushed voice)

                  handled one more reporter.
                          (she appears to hear a noise upstairs)
                  Just a sec, dear.
                          (she comes into the living room and looks toward the upstairs)
                  Sue?
                          (a little louder)
                  Sue?
                          (no answer, she returns to the phone)
                  Sorry, Betty, I just wanted to make sure the phone didn't wake her.
                  We're all a bit edgy.

                  Better. Sleeping too much, I guess, but Schneider says that's to be
                  expected after what she's gone through. He says she's young enough
                  to forget it in time. Knock wood.

   As Eleanor's side of the conversation continues, the camera conveys her tension. Half of her
   is listening and talking to Betty; the rest of her mind is on Sue upstairs. With good reason.
   Because:

<b>343 EXT. EMPTY LOT ­ DAY
</b>
   Where the Horan house used to stand, now vacant. Strewn with beer cans, overgrown with
   grass and weeds and wildflowers. And a FOR SALE sign.

   We PAN over next door where the White house used to stand. It, too, is vacant but utterly
   bald ­ there's been no time for anything to grow here. There is another FOR SALE sign put
   up by Born Realty.

<b>344 SUE SNELL
</b>
   looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring
   at the lot. She's standing there in her white nightgown, barefoot.

<b>345 THE WHITE LOT ­ SUE'S POV
</b>
   as she slowly walks toward it. Underwater, almost floating. We come closer on the sign
   which now starts appearing a bit odder ­ less like a simple FOR SALE sign and more like a
   grave marker.

   And when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk
   on the sign:

<b>                    CARRIE WHITE IS BURNING IN HELL FOR HER SINS
</b>
   And below it, in a second vandal's handwriting, some idiot's notion of one final joke:

<b>                                       JESUS NEVER FAILS

<b>346 SUE

   as she kneels down, putting the wreath she's carrying next to the marker. She proceeds to try
   to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly.

   She stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in the shower. Suddenly, a second
   hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown.

   A bloody hand.

   A hand from the Earth itself.

   Carrie's hand

   It clutches a horrified Sue by the wrist. Tightly. A vice.

   Sue begins screaming uncontrollably. The hand is trying to pull her into the ground. Her
   screams turn into howling.

   Still screaming. But now in her room, waking from what is, indeed, a bad nightmare.
   Upright in bed, screaming her head off, her face covered with perspiration.

   Eleanor Snell rushes into the room to the bed, embraces her hysterical daughter.
