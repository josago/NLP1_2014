</b>
          We skim above a dark, wild ocean. The camera turns toward a
          lone island, Berk. It is a gigantic shard of rock jutting
          straight out of the water.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>          This, is Berk. It's twelve days
          North of hopeless, and a few
          degrees South of freezing to death.
          It's located solidly on the
          meridian of misery.
          The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small
          village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          My village. In a word, sturdy.
          And it's been here for seven
          generations, but every single
          building is new.
          The camera drifts closer, circling.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          We have fishing, hunting, and a
          charming view of the sunsets. The
          only problems are the pests. You
          see, most places have mice or
          mosquitos. We have...
          Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is
          snatched.

<b>                         CUT TO:

<b>          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          A door is pulled open... as a DRAGON swoops directly toward
          it, BLASTING FIRE. The door is SLAMMED. The fire shoots
          through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly
          teenage Viking.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          ...dragons.

</b>
          He reopens the sizzling door, as leaps off of the front
          porch. He weaves through the erupting mayhem as Vikings pour
          out of the buildings, ready for a fight.

          off sheep.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>          Most people would leave. Not us.
          We're Vikings. We have stubbornness
          issues.
          Vikings sound the alarm. Viking men and women pour out into
          the streets, axes in hand.
          ON HICCUP darting through alleys, staying under eaves, making
          his way through the battle.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          My name's Hiccup. Great name, I
          know. But it's not the worst.
          Parents believe a hideous name will
          frighten off gnomes and trolls.
          Like our charming Viking demeanor
          wouldn't do that.
          Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the
          Vikings who throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an
          explosion, knocking Hiccup to the ground.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          . Ack.
          He passes a silent ox of a viking, picking his ear.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Yep, just Ack.
          Enter STOICK, the biggest Viking of all. He yanks Hiccup from
          the path of a strafing dragon and holds aloft to the crowd.

<b>                         STOICK
</b>          Hiccup!?
          (accusingly; to the crowd)
          What is he doing out again?!

</b>          What are you doing out?! Get
          inside!
          The flames light up his scowling face and matted red beard.
          He sets Hiccup down and turns to the sky, searching.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>
<b>                         (IN AWE)
</b>          That's Stoick the Vast. Chief of
          the tribe. They say that when he
          was a baby he popped a dragon's
          head clean off of its shoulders.
          Do I believe it?
          Stoick grabs a wooden cart and hurls it, knocking the
          strafing dragon out of the sky.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Yes I do.
          An EXPLOSION forces Vikings to DUCK. Stoick stands firm,
          brushing flaming debris off of his shoulder.

<b>                         STOICK

</b>          Hoist the torches!
          Massive flaming braziers are raised on poles, lighting up the
          night sky... and revealing swirling dragons of all types.
          Below, Hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into an open
          building with a tall chimney.

<b>          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          He crosses behind a counter, where a peg-legged, one-armed
          hulk of a Blacksmith reshapes blades with a hammer and tongs
          appendage.

<b>                         GOBBER
</b>          Ah! Nice of you to join the party.
          I thought you'd been carried off.
          Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's
          scattered appendages.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too
          muscular for their taste. They
          wouldn't know what to do with all
          this.
          Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.

<b>                         GOBBER
</b>          They need toothpicks, don't they?
          Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to
          the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>          The meathead with attitude and
          interchangeable hands is Gobber.
          I've been his apprentice ever since
          I was little. Well...littler.

          Armed men rush past, flanking others who carry sheep to
          safety. Stoick follows up the rear as, overhead, a dragon
          strafes the rooftops with Napalm-like fire.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>          See? Old village. Lots and lots
          of new houses.

<b>                         VIKING
</b>
<b>          FIRE!
</b>          In response, the fire brigade charges through the plaza --
          four TEENS, tugging a large wooden cask on wheels. From it,
          they fill buckets of water to douse the flames. One among
          them is a cute, energetic Viking girl.
          Hiccup leans out of the stall to watch her.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>          Oh and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout.
          The twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut.
          And...

<b>                         (DREAMY)
</b>          Astrid.
          A SLOW-MOTION explosion erupts behind her, framing her in a
          sexy ball of fire. The others join her, looking awesome and
          heroic.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Their job is so much cooler.
          Hiccup tries to join them as they pass, but he's hooked by
          Gobber and hoisted back inside.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         (PLEADING)
</b>          Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I
          need to make my mark.

<b>                         GOBBER
</b>          Oh, you've made plenty of marks.
          All in the wrong places.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          Please, two minutes. I'll kill a
          dragon. My life will get infinitely
          better. I might even get a date.

<b>                         GOBBER
</b>          You can't lift a hammer. You can't
          swing an axe...
          Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).

<b>          GOBBER (CONT'D)
</b>          ... you can't even throw one of
          these.
          A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it
          at a dive-bombing Gronkle. The bola binds its legs, sending
          it into a heavy crash.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          (ready with the answer)
          Okay fine, but...
          He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a
          bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          ... this will throw it for me.
          Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up,
          equipped with twin bows. They prematurely launch a bola,
          narrowly missing Gobber... and taking out a Viking at the
          counter.

<b>                         (BEAT)

          Gobber tosses him a sword.

</b>          I'll take my chances. Sword.
          Sharpen. Now.
          Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding
          wheel. He stews... fantasizing...

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.)

          Nadders land, gathering like seagulls around a seemingly
          vacant house.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>          A Nadder head is sure to get me at
          least noticed.
          The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and
          walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER.
          Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of
          fish and fly off like loaded pelicans.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop,
          breathing gas into a chimney.

          heads, twice the status.
          A second head pokes through the door and lights it. KABLAM!
          The two heads fly through the explosion, their necks zipping
          together to reveal a single body.
          It flies past Stoick as he climbs to the top of a CATAPULT

          in, ready to spring upon them.
          Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The
          surprised Nadders are caught. Stoick and his men rush in.
          A Nadder blasts a hole through its net. Stoick leaps onto it,
          clamping his thick arms around its head, forcing its jaws
          shut.

<b>          ON THE PLAIN ABOVE
</b>          Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and
          drops the handles to the ground. He cranks several levers,
          unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption.
          He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on
          a gimbal head toward the dark sky.
          He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on
          the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY approaching... and turns
          his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for the final
          strike, completely camouflaged in the night.

          KERTHUNK! The flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon
          off the ground. The bola disappears into the sky, followed by

          Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare
          appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Except for you.
          ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a
          familiar HOLLER and looks up to see...
          HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the
          NIGHTMARE fast on his heels.
          Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.

</b>          Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The
          Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto
          buildings, setting them alight.
          Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only
          shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it, spraying fire all
          around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post. No sign
          of the Nightmare.
          He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape.
          It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished.
          Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare
          to the ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their
          earlier fight. The Nightmare tries to toast him, but only
          coughs up smoke.

</b>          You're all out.
          He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it
          away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick
          turns to Hiccup.

          The burnt brazier pole collapses, sending the massive iron
          basket crashing. It bounces down the hill, destroying as it
          goes and scattering the Vikings who were holding down the
          netted Nadders. The freed dragons escape... with several
          sheep in tow.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          The murmuring crowd eyes Stoick, awaiting his response.

          Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction.
          Gobber leads Hiccup through the walk of shame. They pass the
          teen fire brigade as they snicker.

          A drawn map of the island, covered in X's.
          Hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge, expectantly.
          Sees nothing.
          He adds another 'X' to the page, then scratches his pencil
          over the whole map in frustration. He snaps the book closed
          and pockets it.

          Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him,
          hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree
          trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned
          earth.
          He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail
          tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup approaches,
          beaming.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Whoa!
          Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it.
          Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the weak, wounded
          dragon, dagger poised to strike.
          As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring
          coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look away, but he's drawn back
          to its unnerving, unflinching stare.
          With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with
          his dagger, puffing himself up with false bravado.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I am a VIKING!
          Hiccup raises the dagger, determined to prove his Viking-
          ness. The dragon's labored breathing breaks Hiccup's clenched
          concentration. He opens an eye, uncertainty leaking through.
          The dragon holds the stare. Something profound is exchanged.
          Finally, the Night Fury closes its eye and lowers its head,
          resigned to its fate.
          Hiccup tries to go through with it, holding the dagger
          aloft... fighting himself... until finally lowering it with a
          frustrated sigh.
          He looks over the dragon's chaffed rope wounds.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          I did this.
          He turns to leave. Pauses. And glances back at the dragon,
          chest heaving.
          Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks over his shoulder to ensure that
          no one is watching... then hurries back to cut the ropes.
          The Night Fury's eye shoots open. With the dragon watching
          his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes.
          As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES!
          In a blur, the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down,
          grazing his neck. Looking like it's about to kill him. Hiccup
          is paralyzed. The dragon's breath ruffles his hair. Hiccup
          opens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare
          boring into him. The exchange is intense, profound.
          The dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch
          him, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns
          and takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of
          trees. It bashes against a nearby mountain side, recovers,
          and drops out of view some distance away.
          Winded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps,
          collapses to his knees, and faints.

          over the fire-pit, stirring the coals with his axe. Embers

          Hiccup STRUGGLES to lift his. Gobber helps him and sends him
          running.
          Ruff and Tuff stand amidst a dozen shields. But only one has
          a skull painted on it. They both grab it.

          The Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The

          SPIN like tops and go down.

          She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past
          her and hit Snotlout's shield. He's blasted onto his back.

          Astrid ROLLS to a stop beside Hiccup, who stirs awkwardly,

          Astrid ROLLS away. A split-second later a lava slug knocks
          Hiccup's shield clear off of his arm. Hiccup is exposed.

<b>                         GOBBER

          Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across
          the ring.
          The sudden movement sends the Gronckle chasing after him,
          leaving Astrid in the clear.

          The Gronckle drives straight toward Hiccup, pinning him
          against the wall. It opens its mouth and cocks its tail,
          ready to fire point-blank.
          Gobber lunges in and hooks the Gronckle's mouth at the last
          second, causing its head to jerk back and fire against the
          stone wall above Hiccup's head.

<b>          GOBBER (CONT'D)

          He hoists Hiccup to his feet and walks off. Hiccup looks
          overhead to see a steaming pit in the solid stone wall.

          HICCUP, battered after another disastrous day in the ring. He
          studies the remnants of the discarded bola... revealing that

</b>          So...why didn't you?
          He drops the bola and presses on in the direction it flew
          off. He drops into a rocky crevice and follows it to an...
          ISOLATED COVE complete with a pristine spring pool. He scans
          the high stone walls... then notices a single black SCALE on
          the ground. He crouches and picks it up, studying it.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Well this was stupid.
          SUDDENLY, the NIGHT FURY blasts past him. Hiccup recoils,
          watching the massive beast struggle to climb the walls. It
          flaps violently, then peels away to a rough landing. The
          dragon is trapped.
          Hiccup grins, excited to see it again, and slips closer.
          He watches as the dragon, exhausted and frustrated, leaps
          into the air, beating its wings furiously. Again and again,
          it rolls uncontrolled and CRASHES heavily.
          As if remembering to snap a photo, Hiccup pulls a leather-
          bound book and flips past drawings of weapons to a blank
          page. He sketches the dragon quickly, desperate to record the
          image.
          The Fury claws at the steep rock walls, trying climb out of
          the cove. It SLIPS and falls hard, crushing several saplings.
          The Fury rolls back to his feet and slowly crawls to the
          water's edge. He spots fish in the shallow water and snaps at
          them... but comes up empty. He lowers his head, looking
          weakened.

          ON HICCUP as he spots the problem. He adjusts his drawing,
          carefully erasing one half of the dragon's tail. He
          accidentally drops the charcoal stick. It rolls off of the
          rock outcropping that hides him from view and bounces into
          the cove. TINK. TINK. TINK.
          The Night Fury raises his head, spotting Hiccup. They
          exchange a profound, unflinching stare.

          pounce.
          Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish. Doing so

          The Fury backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the
          same position as before. The dragon closes in over him,
          staring blankly.
          A tense moment passes... then Toothless regurgitates a chunk
          of fish onto Hiccup's lap. They exchange stares. Hiccup
          realizes what Toothless wants him to do.
          Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up.
          The dragon waits expectantly. Hiccup gags and gnaws off a
          bite of the slimy fish. He forces a smile. Toothless mimics
          him.
          Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries to touch him. Toothless
          HISSES and flaps off to a crash on the other side of the

          and curls up on it like a giant dog.
          He turns to find Hiccup seated beside him. Toothless
          tolerates his persistent presence... until Hiccup tries to

          entire sapling, drawing lines in the sand. He rushes here and
          there, making haphazard lines in every direction.
          Finally, Toothless drops the tree and inspects his work. He

          Hiccup stands and takes in the sprawling scribble, amazed by
          it. He accidentally steps onto one of the lines, eliciting an
          instant growl from Toothless. He steps on it again. Toothless
          growls again. Realizing how sensitive he is, Hiccup steps
          carefully between each line, turning round and round until he
          unwittingly bumps into Toothless.
          Toothless snorts. Once again, they're face to face. Hiccup
          slowly extends his hand. Toothless hesitates. Hiccup turns
          his head away and closes his eyes. To his amazement,
          Toothless bridges the gap and presses his muzzle against

          Hiccup enters a small room at the back of the stall. It's
          covered in drawings of weaponry and scale models. He lights a
          candle and lays his sketchbook out on the desk, opening it to
          the drawing of Toothless.
          With a look of determination. Hiccup picks up a charcoal

          They're dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered,
          and dunked in a barrel.
          The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in
          place on a one-to-one schematic. It's a sketch of a
          mechanical fin.

          Hiccup arrives, winded, straining under the weight of a full

          Toothless approaches, sniffing him.

          Toothless nabs it, chews a few times, then spits it out. He
          shakes his head violently, snorts and scrubs his massive
          tongue on the sand. Hiccup takes note.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          No, no, no! It's okay. Yeah, I
          don't like eel much either.
          Toothless focuses on the remainder. With the dragon
          distracted, Hiccup unwraps his prosthetic fin and opens it
          like a fan.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          It's okay.
          Hiccup drops a knee on top of the tail. Toothless' head juts
          up, slows its chewing to a halt.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay...okay..
          The dragon tenses, slowly spreading his wings. Hiccup straps

</b>          Woah! No! No! No!
          Hiccup struggles to hold on to the tail. As the ground speeds
          away, Toothless immediately TIPS into a uncontrolled bank and
          dive.
          Hiccup sees the folded fin rattling uselessly in opposition
          to its flared counterpart. Flap as he may, Toothless can't
          correct his trajectory.

          Hiccup swallows his fear and crawls toward the folded
          prosthetic. He reaches it and YANKS it open. The flared, fan-
          like appendage catches the air, stabilizing the twisting
          tail.

</b>          Yes! Yes, I did it.
          He glances back at Hiccup, busily holding the tail open while
          trying to hold on. They're going to crash.
          Whoomp! Hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the

          Without Hiccup to operate the tail, Toothless does the same,
          plunging in a massive cannonball.
          Hiccup resurfaces, roughed up, but beaming. Toothless appears

          Hiccup rubs Toothless behind the ear, causing him to relax
          and fall over.

          An angry Deadly Nadder approaches Hiccup. Just as Astrid
          moves in to strike, Hiccup performs his special rubbing
          technique, which sends the Nadder down. Astrid and the other

          Hiccup is using a mirror-like object to create a patch of

          Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same light-patch
          trick he used earlier with Toothless. The tiny dragon
          retreats back to it's cage. The teens approach him yet again

          Astrid furiously hurls her axe at a nearby tree. She notices
          Hiccup walking by in the distance, carrying one of his
          trademark harnesses. She quickly tries to follow, but he
          loses her in the woods.

          Hiccup straps a newly designed harness onto Toothless. With
          Toothless tied to a nearby post with a rope. Hiccup rides him
          in the air -- while stationary. Toothless looks like a giant

          The rope breaks and the pair CRASH into a tree. Hiccup's face

          Hiccup nods, trying to look casual. Once the coast is clear,
          he covertly steers Toothless into the Blacksmith's stall.
          Toothless PRESSES himself inside, rooting through stuff and
          making a racket. Astrid, walking nearby, is alerted.

<b>          ASTRID (O.S.)

          Hiccup FREEZES. Then frantically tries to pry the ring off
          the saddle hook. It won't budge.

          ON ASTRID walking along the outside of the Blacksmith's.
          Hiccup JUMPS OUT the window and CLOSES the shutters behind
          him. Hiccup's harness line is stretched through the window,
          still attached to Toothless' saddle.

          weirder.
          Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As
          a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT against the window
          shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate... then gets PULLED
          THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid's face.
          Astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall.
          In the distance, Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen.

          A lone, battered ship is pulled into a slip, overloaded with
          equally battered-looking men. They disembark to a crowd of
          onlookers, looking like a team of hometown heroes who just
          had their butts kicked.
          Gobber hobbles through the MUMBLING crowd to find Stoick --

          Toothless and Hiccup soar through a perfect blue sky.
          Billowing clouds rise like mountains. The ground seems miles
          below them.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          Okay there bud, we're gonna take
          this nice and slow.
          Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his
          harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and
          their pedal position equivalents.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Here we go. Here we go...position
          three, no four.
          He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll
          off into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon
          sun.
          Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new
          harness and vest are holding. The foot controls make the tail
          appendage quick and responsive. He watches Toothless' every
          fluctuation, trying to match it with the prosthetic.
          Hiccup sizes up a target -- a towering arch of stone, rising
          from the sea.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on. Come on buddy. Come on
          buddy!
          They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Yeah! Yes, it worked!
          The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several
          sea stacks as Hiccup tries to keep up with the turns.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry.
          They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          My fault.
          Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate.

</b>          Position four, no three.
          They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see
          the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with every
          passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the
          handles.

          ... and NABS IT before it's carried out of reach. Toothless,
          however, obeys the command and suddenly STOPS beating his
          wings.
          As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless. The rings of
          his vest float off of the harness hooks. Hiccup suddenly
          finds himself detached, free-falling.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh gods! Oh no!
          Without Hiccup, the tail loses control. Hiccup and Toothless
          spiral downward. Toothless FIGHTS to get back under Hiccup.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda
          angle yourself. No, no...come back
          down towards me. Come back down--
          Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much
          surface area as he can. He angles back towards Toothless as
          the tumbling dragon WHACKS Hiccup with his wing.
          After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the
          harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull
          Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops.
          They careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a
          treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks.
          Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to
          check positions. It flaps violently in the turbulence, making
          it impossible.
          With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers
          Toothless' tail on instinct... with perfect intuition.
          Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split-
          second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed.
          Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying
          obstacle course, now safely behind them. He beams, relieved.
          He sits back and throws his arms up in victory.

          Hiccup and Toothless lounge on a sprawling, deserted beach,
          snacking of freshly caught fish. As Hiccup cooks his over a
          fire, Toothless suddenly regurgitates a fish head. Hiccup
          smirks with forced politeness.

          Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing and
          nipping at each other as they approach Toothless' pile of
          fish.
          One grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away.
          Another attempts to steal it from him. They face off and last
          fire balls at each other to settle the fight. Hiccup and
          Toothless watch, amused. That is until...
          Toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile. A stealthy
          Terrible Terror is exposed as the thief. They tug on the
          fish, and it snaps back into Toothless' mouth. He swallows it
          back tauntingly.
          Irate, the little dragon paws at the ground and blast
          Toothless. He opens his mouth, the gas hiss comes, and
          Toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its mouth, causing
          the gas to backfire into the little dragon. It coughs up
          smoke and staggers away, looking ill.
          Hiccup laughs.

          The appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and
          approaches Hiccup cautiously. He curls up next to him. Hiccup
          is amazed.

          Hiccup carefully pets him... sending the Terror into an
          immediate, blissful sleep.

</b>
          HICCUP is lost in thought, his head laid of a desk full of
          Toothless drawings. Burdened with the weight of the world.
          Suddenly, STOICK appears in the doorway. Hiccup jumps and
          quickly covers up his desk.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          Dad! You're back!
          He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the
          prosthetic fin, and other drawings.

          A Gronckle hovers above the ring, hunting victims as the teen
          recruits scramble.
          Astrid ducks behind a barrier to find Hiccup already there.
          She forces her axe at his throat.

          He locks eyes with Hiccup, giving him a nod of encouragement.
          Hiccup adjusts his new helmet and forces a half-hearted
          smile.
          Unbeknownst to Hiccup, the Gronckle spots him and makes a bee-
          line toward him.

          shakes her head 'no.' The crowd 'Oooohs.'
          Gobber then points to Hiccup. The elder nods an affirmative

          ASTRID races through the trees. A large shadow overtakes her.
          She is suddenly SNATCHED into the air. Astrid SCREAMS.

<b>                         ASTRID

          Hiccup and Toothless fly Astrid to the top of a towering
          pine. It bows and creaks under their weight as Astrid dangles
          a hundred feet in the air.

<b>          ASTRID (CONT'D)
</b>          Hiccup! Get me down from here!

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          You have to give me a chance to

<b>                         ASTRID
</b>          I'm not listening to ANYTHING you

</b>          Then I won't speak. Just let me
          show you.
          Hiccup extends a hand.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Please, Astrid.
          She eyes him and the dragon, then the ground far, far below.
          After a moment, she swats Hiccup's outstretched hand away and
          reluctantly climbs over the pedal, lines, and harness. She
          settles behind Hiccup, avoiding as much contact as possible.

<b>                         ASTRID
</b>          Now get me down.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          Toothless? Down. Gently.
          Toothless leers mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly.
          With a WHOP, they fill with the updraft. Toothless releases
          the tree, tucks in his legs, and HOVERS in place.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          See? Nothing to be afraid of.
          Toothless suddenly LAUNCHES straight upward. Astrid SCREAMS.
          The acceleration is tremendous. Every downbeat bucks the
          saddle, heaving them into the sky, doubling their speed like
          a rocket. Astrid is thrown backward. She SCREAMS and hugs
          Hiccup for dear life, squeezing the breath out of him.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Toothless! What is wrong with you?!

          Toothless ROLLS and PLUMMETS toward the coastline far below.
          Astrid SCREAMS.
          Toothless rockets over the ocean waves, deliberately dipping
          them in the froth.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Toothless, what are you doing?!
          We need her to like us!
          Toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over tail.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          And now the spinning. Thank you for
          nothing you useless reptile.
          Astrid clamps her hand over her eyes.

<b>                         ASTRID
</b>          Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just
          get me off of this thing.
          Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone. Satisfied,
          Toothless relents.
          They level off and head up into the clouds. Astrid opens her
          eyes again, and looks out over a world she'd never dreamed
          of. She reaches out and touches clouds, pierces columns
          ablaze in golden hues, and floats over a vast, alien sky-
          scape. Her terror is replaced by wonder. She grins, despite
          herself.
          Toothless rises above a blanket of clouds...

          ...and levels off under a starry sky. They emerge from a
          blanket of clouds under the dancing Northern Lights,
          shimmering in ribbons across the vast sky.
          Below them, Berk's torches flicker in the inky darkness. The
          new perspective is breathtaking.
          Astrid tucks her arms into Hiccup's vest, burying her chin
          into his shoulder. The moment is not lost on either of them.
          Hiccup smiles nervously.
          Toothless climbs past Berk's tallest peaks and heads out over
          open water, leaving the village lights behind them.

          Astrid carefully reaches down and pats Toothless' side.

<b>          ASTRID (CONT'D)
</b>          So what now?
          Hiccup groans. It's a problem without an answer.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          Don't remind me.
          A strange, unearthly din approaches. Toothless' ear plates
          suddenly stand on end. Panicked, he abruptly dives, dipping
          into cloud cover.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Toothless! What's happening? What

          Toothless BARKS at him. 'Quiet!'
          Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a Monstrous Nightmare
          emerges.

          Hiccup and Astrid duck. The Nightmare calls out. A Zippleback
          appears to the other side of Toothless, boxing him in.

          Other dragons, previously invisible in the thick clouds,
          appear all around them. HUNDREDS of them, all carrying fish
          and game in their talons.

          The Zippleback eyes them ravenously.

<b>                         ASTRID
</b>          What does that make us?
          The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through
          the thickening fog and weaving between towering, craggy sea
          stacks.
          They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera,
          glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of dragons fall into
          rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a
          winding tunnel.
          It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with
          pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in
          hordes.
          The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into
          a central pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist.
          Hiccup is amazed.

</b>          What my dad wouldn't give to find
          this.
          Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small
          shadowy shelf to keep a low-profile.
          Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of
          sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped into
          the pit.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          It's satisfying to know that all of
          our food has been dumped down a
          hole.

          Last to arrive is a dim-witted Gronckle. It hovers over the
          pit and regurgitates his paltry contribution -- a pathetic
          little fish. As it falls into the steamy pit, a terrible ROAR
          rings out.
          The Gronckle tries to flee, but before it can, a gargantuan
          dragon head juts from the steamy pit and SNAPS it out of the
          air. Swallowing it back whole.
          Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified.

<b>          ASTRID (CONT'D)
</b>          What is that?
          The monstrous beast SNIFFS the air, seemingly aware of them.
          It nears the ledge where Toothless is hiding... and ROARS.
          Several dragons take flight in fear.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          Alright buddy, we gotta get out of
          here. Now!
          Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping
          jaws.
          The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback
          out of the air instead.
          Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of
          dragons flee the caldera in fear.

<b>          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - NIGHT - LATER

          Toothless glides into the cove and touches down on the
          moonlit beach.

          No, no, it totally makes sense.
          It's like a giant beehive. They're
          the workers... and that's their
          queen. It controls them.
          She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village.

          Beat.
          BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire.
          Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames. It tears
          out of its cave like an irate bull -- as the crowd roars and
          jeers.
          It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing
          at the provoking crowd and blasting fire.

          It spots Hiccup and descends, leering and licking the flaming
          drool from its lips.
          The crowd grows silent, bracing for the big fight.
          With the Monstrous Nightmare's eyes locked upon him, Hiccup
          deliberately drops his shield and dagger stepping away from
          them. The dragon pauses, confused.
          ON STOICK, also confused.

<b>                         STOICK
</b>          What is he doing?
          The dragon presses closer, snorting. Hiccup extends his open
          hand. It snarls.

</b>          It's okay. It's okay.
          The dragon continues to pace, focused on... HICCUP'S HELMET.
          Hiccup realizes, then reaches up and removes it. Taking a
          breath to acknowledge the point of no return, he tosses the
          helmet aside. It hits the ground.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          GASPS and MURMURS race through the crowd.
          ON STOICK, as all eyes turn to him. He's welling with upset.
          Hiccup avoids Stoick's glare and remains focused on the
          Nightmare, holding his hand out. It paces around him, calming
          down.

          Stoick whacks his hammer against the iron enclosure, rattling
          the arena with a terrible reverberating clatter.
          Spooked, the Nightmare snaps at Hiccup's outstretched hand.
          Hiccup YELPS and springs backward.
          The spell is broken. The Nightmare reacts to Hiccup's sudden
          movements and blasts another stream of fire. Hiccup SCREAMS
          and barely dives out of reach.

          Hiccup scrambles around the ring. The Nightmare pursues,
          snapping and springing from ground to wall.
          Stoick pushes through the crowd, rushing to the doorway.

          through.

</b>
          Toothless bounds to the cove walls, clawing them in
          desperation. It seems he's as trapped as before, but with an
          incredible BURST of effort he HOOKS a claw over the upper lip
          of the stone wall.

<b>          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          A narrow stream of fire narrowly avoids Hiccup as he
          continues to dash around the ring, evading the Monstrous
          Nightmare. Desperate, he goes to the weapon rack in an
          attempt to arm himself, but the Nightmare quickly destroys
          the rack and closes in on him.

          Toothless tears through the woods, bounding like panther and

          Stoick wrenches the grated door to the arena and jumps
          through. The Monstrous Nightmare is only a few feet behind
          Hiccup. Astrid is now in the ring.

<b>                         ASTRID
</b>          Hiccup!
          She picks up a hammer and hurls it at the Monstrous
          Nightmare, hitting it in the head. It turns its attention to
          Astrid, and begins chasing her. Stoick raises the arena gate,
          waving her toward it.

<b>                         STOICK
</b>          This way!
          Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the
          doorway, cutting Hiccup off. It pounces on him and prepares
          to finish him off.
          Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din.

<b>                         GOBBER
</b>          Night Fury! Get down!
          Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the
          chain enclosure. He flies through it and disappears in the
          boiling smoke.
          The Vikings rush to railings... in time to see a flurry of
          wings cutting through the dissipating smoke. Toothless and
          the Nightmare tumble into the clear, locked in a toothy,
          vicious fight. Toothless kicks the Nightmare off and plants
          himself between Hiccup and it.
          The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and
          ROARS... causing the Nightmare to relent and back away.
          To everyone's shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet and
          grabs Toothless protectively.

          Hiccup tries to shoo Toothless away in vain. Vikings begin
          pouring clambering through the enclosure and dropping into
          the ring.

          Toothless ducks and pounces on him. They tumble end over end.

          Stoick gets to his feet, fuming, shaken. A Viking presents
          Stoick with an axe. He eyes Toothless a moment, then pushes
          the axe back into the Viking's hands.

          carved pillars -- a legacy of heroes, all peering down in
          angered judgement.

          Below on the docks, Vikings load the heavy artillery into the

          Lastly, Toothless is loaded aboard Stoick's ship, chained
          down to a palette, muzzled, and restrained with a weighty

          Stoick crosses to the bow as the ship pushes off and joins
          the amassed armada of ships adrift in the harbor.
          Stoick's brow is furrowed, all warmth drained away. He turns
          west and glares at the horizon with cold determination.

          The armada coasts toward a shroud of heavy fog, hung like
          drapes from a low-hanging, ominous sky.
          The ships enter, one by one. Visibility drops immediately.
          Flanking ships becomes ghosts. The armada disappears, drawn
          into the blinding mist. Complete whiteout. Nothing remains

          Gobber approaches him, speaking under his breath.

          sky, converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs the
          air.

          into shallow black sand.
          Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The

          Nightmare out of its cave. It snorts, stepping into the ring,
          calmed by Hiccup's outstretched hand -- focused on him.

          putting him in control of the massive beast. The Nightmare
          snorts, but remains calm. Snotlout, by contrast, chuckles
          nervously -- it's at once terrifying and amazing.

          a gargantuan dragon emerges -- THE RED DEATH. Stirred and

          (turns to the others)
          Everybody to the far side of the
          island!
          The Vikings scatter into the rocks like ants. Satisfied with
          the ships destruction, The Red Death turns its attention back
          to the Vikings. They seem to have vanished. It SNIFFS the
          air, searching for their scent.
          Gobber drops in beside Stoick, like two soldiers in a trench.
          Fire blasts over head, causing them to duck.

<b>                         STOICK

          Gobber removes Stoick's hand. Clenches his forearm,
          determined.

<b>                         GOBBER
</b>          Then I can double that time.
          Stoick grins. Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER and
          dash into the open, SPLITTING UP. Stoick rips a sharpened
          post from the ground and hurls it into the monster's face.

          The Red Death remains focused on Stoick - this is it. It
          rears back and inhales. Gas begins to amass, when...
          KABLAM! A BLAST explodes against the back of The Red Death's
          head. It turns distracted, as...
          ... a Nadder punches through the flames, banking across the
          sky. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a
          Gronckle. They roll in unison, revealing the recruits riding
          on their backs. Hiccup leads, with Astrid clinging to his
          waist.
          GOBBER AND STOICK, watch slack-jawed, in awe.

          The monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake.
          Hiccup directs his squadron out of harm's way. They climb out
          of reach and circle each other.

          Hiccup and Astrid peel away. The teens bank and dive toward

          The Red Death unloads a spray of fire at the twins. They
          barely dodge it.
          Fishlegs and Snotlout hang behind its eyes, banging away at
          their shields, making a racket.

          He steers the Nadder over the deck and hands Astrid the
          reins. He lines up his jump... and hops off, guarding his

          He gets to work on the chains.

</b>          Yeah! It's working.
          PAN DOWN to reveal that the noise is also confusing the
          Gronckle and the Monstrous Nightmare. Both dragons lose their
          bearings.
          The Red Death thrashes, knocking Snotlout off of his dragon
          and onto the monster's gigantic head. Snotlout bounces across
          the top and comes to a stop just shy of the hundred foot
          drop.

          He hurls Snotlout his hammer. The Gronkle crashes and skids
          to a stop...

          Snotlout grins, finally vindicated in her eyes. In his
          distraction, he gets thrown and lands heavily on one of the
          Red Death's spines -- clinging precariously. A close call.

          THE RED DEATH blasting at the teens, enraged.
          The monster's giant foot crashes through frame, smashing the
          bow under its impressive weight.
          Hiccup and Toothless are thrown into the water in a maelstrom
          of burning planks and rigging.

<b>                         UNDERWATER
</b>          Hiccup swims toward Toothless. They're both caught in a mess
          of rigging, being dragged down. The heavy palette settles
          into the rocky bottom like an anchor. Toothless has stopped
          struggling. Hiccup takes one more hopeless tug at the chains -
          he's almost out of air.
          Suddenly, a meaty hand grabs Hiccup.
          STOICK explodes to the surface, pulling Hiccup to the
          shoreline through flaming debris. He lays him down, under the
          shelter of an overhanging rock.

<b>                         UNDERWATER
</b>          ON TOOTHLESS, drowning. Stoick appears in front of him.
          Toothless freezes. Stoick tears the chains off of the yoke
          and lets it float free.
          Momentary stillness. They eye each other, through the churned
          up bubbles. Toothless lunges out of the bars -- grabbing
          Stoick.
          BOOM! In an explosion of sea water, Toothless lands on the
          shore, setting Stoick down and releasing him. Hiccup is awed.
          The ground rumbles underfoot. The monster screeches. Its
          massive claws stomp around in the smoke.
          Stoick gives way as Toothless mounts the rock and raises his
          wings. He turns to Hiccup and SNORTS - â€˜Let's go.'

          Stoick lets go of Hiccup's arm.
          Hiccup spurs Toothless on, charged with his father's belief
          in him. They rocket into the sky as Stoick watches.

          monster.
          Snotlout sees the Zippleback diving toward him and DASHES
          down the Red Death's head. He runs up the end of its horn...
          As the twins sweep past, both missing him... but perfectly
          snatching him where the necks merge. Ruff and Tuff eye each
          other, surprised and impressed.

          Hiccup and Toothless rocket past the Red Death's head and
          climb, higher and higher.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>
<b>                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
</b>          That thing has wings! Okay, let's
          see if it can use them!
          Hiccup pulls Toothless into a turn. They plummet, gaining
          tremendous speed. The wind buffets them as they target the
          Red Death as super sonic speed.
          KABLAM! Toothless unloads a fireball against the Red Death's
          head. It goes down with a rumble as they climb anew.

<b>          ON THE GROUND
</b>          The Vikings shield themselves from the dust of the fallen
          monster... as its wings unfold and extend.

<b>          IN THE AIR
</b>          Hiccup looks back as they put distance between them.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you think that did it?
          Suddenly, the enraged behemoth RISES into frame... flapping
          its wings furiously. A daunting sight.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Well, he can fly.
          Hiccup and Toothless DIVE into the tangled sea stacks - they
          weave through the rock like rabbits through a briar. The Red
          Death SNAPS at them, but cannot reach them. Hiccup and
          Toothless PULL AHEAD.
          The Red Death SMASHES through the canopy of rock and pulls in
          behind Toothless. He BURSTS THROUGH fifty-foot formations
          like they were saplings.

<b>          ON THE GROUND

</b>          Woohoo! Yeah!
          A moment later the Red Death SMASHES the sea stacks to dust
          in hot pursuit. The Vikings mood is quenched.

          Hiccup and Toothless can't slow the monster down. Hiccup eyes
          the clouds above. An idea hits him. He locks eyes with
          Toothless.

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          Okay Toothless, time to disappear.
          Toothless PULLS into a steep climb, heading toward the
          clouds.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on bud!
          The Red Death follows, closing in fast.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          (hearing the gas)
          Here it comes!
          BLAST! They narrowly dodge a column of flame and smoke. They
          reach the low-hanging clouds and pierce them. The monster
          follows, immediately losing them in the hampered visibility.
          It roars irritably.
          From out of nowhere, Toothless DIVES at the huge dragon,
          BLASTING and PUNCTURING a hole in its wing. Toothless and
          Hiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at
          them.

<b>          ON THE GROUND
</b>          The Vikings stare up at the sky listening to the resounding
          BOOMS and watching FLASHES light up the clouds.
          Gobber places a hand on Stoick's shoulder.

<b>          IN THE AIR
</b>          HICCUP and TOOTHLESS dive in again and again, using the
          clouds to hide and surprise as they puncture the monster's
          wings.
          It BELLOWS in frustration and WHIRLS around, unleashing fire
          blindly, in all directions.
          Hiccup sees the glow of fire cutting towards them.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Watch out!
          The random blast CLIPS Toothless' tail. It's heavily damaged.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, time's up. Let's see if this
          works.
          He pulls Toothless into a turn. They fly directly into the
          Red Death's face, taunting it.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on! Is that the best you can
          do!?
          Toothless utters an insult too, and they jackknife into a
          steep dive. The Red Death pursues.
          Toothless PUMPS his wings, racing faster than he's ever gone
          before. Hiccup and Toothless stay just ahead of the Red Death
          -- no longer trying to evade it.
          Hiccup glances back to check the tail - it's disintegrating.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Stay with me buddy. We're good.
          Just a little bit longer.
          The Red Death closes the gap. Hiccup tucks in and holds
          Toothless steady -- allowing the monster to set its sights on
          them. It narrows its eyes.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Hold, Toothless.
          The Red Death OPENS his mouth. The familiar gas HISS emanates
          from his throat -- ignition is coming.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>          NOW!
</b>          Hiccup HITS the PEDALS HARD as Toothless extends one wing.
          They PIVOT in place, hurtling directly into the Red Death's
          mouth.
          Toothless FIRES point blank down the monster's throat. Its
          amassing gas is ignited, BACKFIRING into the monster,
          erupting in a chain of blasts throughout its body.
          Hiccup and Toothless BURST from the clouds, the Red Death hot
          on their tail, exploding from within. It glances forward and
          sees the ground rushing up. It throws open its wings,
          attempting to put on the brakes, but the punctured, damaged
          wings can't stop its momentum.
          As the Red Death chokes on the expanding fireball, he sees
          Toothless suddenly pull out of the dive, streaking up, past
          its head.

          The Red Death HITS the ground, head-first. It EXPLODES like
          the Hindenburg.
          Hiccup and Toothless weave through the monster's massive back
          plates, wings, and flailing legs -- a high-speed recall of
          the FREE FALL slalom run. The expanding fireball races toward
          them, about to swallow them.
          They manage to clear the obstacles. Hiccup glances back.
          They're outrunning the fireball.
          He looks forward just in time to see the monster's massive
          club tail careening toward them.
          He tries to shift their direction. The last shreds of
          Toothless' tail tear away. Hiccup's pedals go DEAD.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          No. No.
          Hiccup and Toothless can't maneuver - they're dead in the
          air. The giant club tail CLIPS Toothless, TEARING Hiccup from
          the harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of
          the fast-approaching fireball.
          Toothless STRUGGLES with all his might to reach the
          unconscious Hiccup. But the fireball swallows them both.

<b>          ON THE GROUND
</b>          The Vikings watch in horror as Hiccup and Toothless disappear
          into the boiling inferno.

          scorched. Even the ground is smoking from the terrible heat.

<b>          STOICK (CONT'D)

          He hurries to the dragon's side. Toothless is roughed up, but
          conscious. His scorched saddle, however, is vacant.
          Stoick looks to the sky in despair. He buckles at the knees,
          overwhelmed by the loss.

<b>          STOICK (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh son...I did this...
          Astrid pushes through the crowd, her eyes welling up.
          Followed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he kneels, slumped
          over.
          Behind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a respectful
          distance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild
          dragons can also be seen, gathering just behind and between
          the Vikings.
          Toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick.
          Their eyes meet.

<b>          STOICK (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm so sorry...
          Toothless unfolds his wings, revealing Hiccup, unconscious,
          clutched safely against his chest. Stoick's eyes widen.

<b>          STOICK (CONT'D)
</b>          Hiccup.
          He scoops Hiccup into his arms. Listens to his heart. Bursts
          into relieved laughter.

          The crowd roars. Followed by the dragons. The Vikings look
          around to find themselves surrounded.
          Stoick leans close to Toothless, meeting him eye to eye.

          Toothless hovers over him, WHINING and GRUMBLING impatiently.
          Hiccup stirs. Opens his eyes.

<b>                         HICCUP

<b>                         (GROGGY)

</b>          Okay, okay! I'm happy to see you

          Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT
          UPRIGHT with a YELP.
          He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside
          the fire pit on the main floor of his house.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          over him, excited)
          You're in my house.
          Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far
          too big for the space.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Uh...does my dad know you're in

          Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He
          eyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with
          'happy dog' energy.

          Hiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing
          that something is wrong.
          He peels back the covers slowly. What he sees startles,
          horrifies, and overwhelms him -- all at once.

<b>          ON THE BARE FLOOR
</b>          His booted foot touches down. Followed by a mechanical
          prosthetic in place of his second leg. It's an ingenious
          spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron.
          Toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing
          the new leg. He raises his eyes to meet Hiccup's, seemingly
          aware of what Hiccup is going through.
          Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on
          it. He winces and stifles the pain...

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay...okay...
          ... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches

          stabilizing him.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Thanks bud.
          Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps
          together.
          Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make
          their way toward the door.
          Hiccup pries it open (as he did in the opening scene),
          revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door.
          Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to
          Toothless, alarmed.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Toothless? Stay here, bud.
          Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks
          outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open,
          revealing...

          Vikings and dragons mill about by the dozen, basking on the
          rooftops, weaving along the plaza. No one seems upset, there
          isn't a sword in sight.
          Under the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire
          onto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it
          into shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in
          his mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats
          his head. Another Viking backs a Zippleback into a stall to
          check it for size.
          Hiccup takes a step outside, finding Stoick waiting for him
          on the step.

<b>          GOBBER (O.S.)
</b>          Well. Most of you.
          Gobber pushes through the crowd, beaming proudly.

<b>          GOBBER (CONT'D)
</b>          (re: the prosthetic leg)
          That bit's my handiwork. With a
          little Hiccup flare thrown in.
          Think it'll do?

<b>                         HICCUP
</b>          (bittersweet, coming to

<b>                         TERMS)
</b>          I might make a few tweaks.
          Astrid appears and jabs Hiccup in the arm. Hiccup recoils
          with a grumble.

<b>                         ASTRID
</b>          That's for scaring me.

<b>                         HICCUP

          She grabs him aggressively... then kisses him. Hoots and
          hollers follow.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          ... could get used to it.
          Gobber presents Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and
          tail.

<b>                         GOBBER
</b>          Welcome home.
          Suddenly, Toothless pounces on the crowd, crushing several
          unsuspecting Vikings under his weight.

<b>                         VIKING
</b>          Night Fury, get down!
          Toothless eyes the new tail excitedly, tongue wagging. Amidst
          the groans and grumbles, Hiccup and Astrid exchange a
          sheepish grin.

<b>                         CLOSE ON

<b>                         CLOSE ON
</b>          Hiccup's prosthetic foot, snapping into the modified stirrup.

          The two pieces click together, forming a single shape.
          Astride Toothless, he's whole again. He rotates the pedal.
          The new tail opens. Bright red with a skull and Viking horns
          emblazoned on it. Hiccup approves.

<b>          CUT BACK TO REVEAL...
</b>          Hiccup and Toothless, saddled up and ready to fly. Astrid
          backs her Nadder into position.

<b>                         HICCUP

<b>                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
</b>          You ready?
          Toothless SNORTS an excited 'yes!'
          From his mount, Hiccup looks out over the changed world.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          This... is Berk.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          It snows nine months of the year...
          and hails the other three.
          They LEAP into the bright blue sky, together as one. Astrid
          follows, giving chase.

<b>          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Any food that grows here is tough
          and tasteless. The people that grow
          here are even more so.
          Hiccup and Astrid race their dragons through the village --
          under eaves, over rooftops, down cliff-sides, and between
          ship masts. It's a high energy, romantic dance of sorts.

<b>          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          The only upsides are the pets.
          While other places have...ponies or
          parrots, we have...
          Their fellow recruits join them as they take to the open sky,
          rocketing far above the village. The Northern sky swirls with
          blazing, multicolored dragons.
          Hiccup and Toothless break from the pack, spinning into the
          blinding sun.
