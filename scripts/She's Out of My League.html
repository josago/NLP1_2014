</b><b>          
</b>          A dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room.
          A slide projector dimly lights MR. FULLER, a crew-cutted
          Robert Stack type in a suit, as he addresses the group. The
          current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry
          figure - it could be any of about a billion people.

                    for this bastard. (THEN) Before we
                    dismiss, this is your monthly
                    reminder of why we're here.

</b>          Fuller advances to a slide of the American flag. Close on
          one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties.
          He politely pays close attention to the presentation.

                    (Slide: Family in front of a fake
                    dinosaur) They want to attend
                    baseball contests (Slide: Fat guys
                    spilling beers as they go for a

                    concerts. (Slide: John Tesh)
<b>          
</b>          Close on another face in the group. A doughy man with three-
          day scruff and a trendily long haircut. He looks bored,
          rolling his eyes at the speech.

</b>                    They want to be happy. (Slide: People
                    line dancing) But, Security comes
                    first. (Slide: Army soldier with a
                    massive machine gun guards a play-
                    ground) Without security there can be
                    no happy. You are America's front
                    line in the global war on terror.
                    Let's hit the trenches and let's be
                    careful out there. (Slide: TSA logo)

          look at their uniforms. The TSA agents move out into the...

</b>          The agents take their places, manning the screening
          equipment. We push in on the bald man as he takes up his
          post next to the walk-through metal detector. This is KIRK
          KETTNER. He is not a looker. His uniform only serves to
          highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and
          demeanor are pleasant and kind.

</b>          The scruffy agent is STAINER. He stands at the x-ray
          monitor. As the bags begin to move through, he does not pay
          any attention, rather he hands Kirk a flyer.

</b>          A Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line. Mr.

          white; each are dealing with customers. They simultaneously
          notice our woman. They suspiciously eye one another and the

                    charity events and I get to work
                    with some of the most amazing human
                    beings on some really fun projects.
                    Next month I'm doing a cancer

<b>          
</b>          Reese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late.
          The Sharks score and the crowd revolts. A red-haired redneck
          woman, sitting two rows back, calls out to Molly and company.

                    you can deduct a few points for dumb
                    or shallow but she went to law
                    school and her sister's blind.
                    That's a hard ten, friends, and that
                    is rare. A seven point disparity -
                    that's a chasm. The most you can
                    jump is two points. I can't even
                    get a ten.

                    Eric... Oh, for God's sake, boy!
                    How can you be sure it's even
                    yours? It could be practically
                    anybody's!... No, I'm not paying
                    for that!... Well, then I guess
                    you're going to be a daddy.
                    Congratulations, now I gotta go!

</b>                    Anyway! I love all of you, despite
                    some of the shit you pulled, but I
                    spent my life a gambler and I always
                    put my money on the best bet. The
                    odds of any of you fish doing
                    anything worthwhile with my stack
                    are slim to none. So old Grammy's
                    going all in on Big Slick.

</b>                    He is. He's wonderful. I know, I
                    know - the blue eyes and the rock
                    hard abs, right? But he's really
                    so much more than that. A gallery
                    in New York just opened an exhibit
                    of his photography. He's a genius.

          the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the
          balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college
          students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a
          bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of
          Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf.

</b>          Molly walks around and examines certain items. Kirk quietly
          hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer
          desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears.
          Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer
          comes to life, revealing a "Hot Back-Door Asians" website.
          Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the
          monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She
          moves on to a rack of DVDs.

</b>          Molly brushes his hair back with her hand. Kirk is frozen
          with fear. Molly leans in. Kirk also leans in but not too
          far. Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make
          this official. She takes him by the collar, reels him in and
          kisses him. They make out for a moment. Kirk is near panic
          but he does his best to keep it together.

          not subtle. He looks down and starts to panic.

          few deep, calming breaths.   He closes the fridge - still at
          full alert. Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building.
          He grabs a Time Magazine. He flips through frantically. He
          turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal
          women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article.

</b>          Kirk gives an "aw-shucks" head tilt.    Molly stands.

</b>          They walk to the door. Molly leans in and they kiss a few
          moments more. Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little
          snug. She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to
          retrieve them. Suddenly she starts coughing. She puts her
          fist over her mouth.

</b>          Kirk's POV:   As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch.
<b>          
</b>          Kirk winces again. She hears the tape start to give way.
          She looks up, slightly confused. Kirk looks around as though
          he's looking for the source of the sound. Molly stands.

</b><b>          
</b>          Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile
          continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk
          sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open
          like a shot and he reaches for his phone - "No Missed Calls."
<b>          
</b><b>          MONTAGE OVER MUSIC:
</b><b>          
</b>          1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom.   He checks his
          gut and hairline in the mirror.
<b>          
</b>          2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the
          box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached
          along with a card that reads, "Happy Graduation - Love Mom
          and Dad." He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads
          the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor.
          He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses
          underneath him. He checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
<b>          
</b>          3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the
          cupboards.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    53.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl.
          He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal
          and then checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
<b>          
</b>          3) He surfs the web. He reads info on the Hair Club For Men
          site. He moves to Hot_or_Not.com. The first woman is very
          pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and
          gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her
          score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten.
          He checks his phone. He moves on to "BackDoorAsians.com."
<b>          
</b>          4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower
          third reads, "AMC's 24 Hours of Bond." No Missed Calls. The
          sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls.
          Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them
          as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching
          Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is
          creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is
          still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls.
<b>          
</b>          5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess -
          tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the
          magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous
          picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur
          Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his
          own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack.
<b>          
</b>          6) Kirk is walking home. Every street sign, billboard and T-
          shirt he sees reads, "NO MISSED CALLS."

</b>          He stands in the shower sulking. He hears the phone ring in
          the next room. He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts
          to dry off as he runs into the bedroom. He reaches the
          charger base but the phone is not there. He stands and
          listens hard to the ringing. He runs into the living room.
          Angle on the phone. It's hiding under a pillow on the couch.
          In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up
          papers and magazines. The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's
          panic increases until he finally spots the phone. Kirk dives
          for it, losing his towel in the process.

          Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer
          who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer.

</b>          Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus
          stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk.
          Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty,
          ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit.

</b><b>          MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE:
</b><b>          
</b>          1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd.
          Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on
          Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close
          on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate
          formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell
          out "MOLLY" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly
          (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his
          insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)
<b>          
</b>          2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes
          his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the
          screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.
          The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another
          man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and
          stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's
          gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind
          Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is
          oblivious to this exchange.
<b>          
</b>          3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has
          stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,
          he is tackled by two cops.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 COP

</b>          Molly spins around, horrified.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 COP (CONT'D)
</b>                       It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of
                       shit was following you but we got
                       him.
<b>          
</b>          Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the
          cop's grasp.
<b>          
</b>          4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at
          the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal
          detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out
          of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels
          he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has
          come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and
          carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up
          and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.

<b>          
</b>          They each feel Molly's face and then start elbowing one
          another like a couple of horny construction workers.
<b>          
</b>          A cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but
          uncopyrighted birthday song. Katie blows out her candles.

<b>          
</b>          Kirk's face drops. Molly kisses her sister on the forehead
          as she has obviously coached the response. Immediately Patty
          is behind Kirk, pushing him. Kirk tries to politely decline
          but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the
          piano bench. Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play.
<b>

</b>          Kirk is sweating. He reaches for the keys but he is now
          white as a ghost. Molly watches in suspense, rethinking
          what she's done. Kirk's hands shake. He moves them around,
          hunting for a place to begin. The party-goers stare and the
          room gets quiet. Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though
          he might vomit.
<b>          
</b>          Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar. Suddenly,
          a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound
          system. Katie jumps up to dance with her friends.
<b>          
</b>          Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off.    Talon
          appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.

<b>          
</b>          Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute. Kirk holds

<b>          
</b>          They sit on the couch talking. Kirk is on!    He is confident

</b>          They are making out passionately on the couch.
<b>          
</b>          Molly stands and extends her hand to Kirk. Kirk stands and
          his boner is impossible to miss. This time he looks down at

          leads him into the bedroom.
<b>          
</b>          Kirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom. He
          lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness
          but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of
          gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out.
<b>          
</b>          Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this.   He
          decides to sit.
<b>          
</b>          Molly opens the door. She is wearing sexy ligerie and
          slippers. She looks perfect. She crosses to the bed and

                    sorry for my tardiness. The next
                    item up for bids is from nine-year-
                    old Walter Benegan. And this is
                    a... little something that you can
                    put your paper clips or do-dads
                    in... Oh, who am I kidding, it's an
                    ashtray. (audience laughs) Let's
                    start the bidding at one hundred
                    dollars.

</b><b>                              MOLLY

</b><b>                              KIRK

</b>          Kirk stands up.

                    made of wood you know.
<b>          
</b>          Molly hugs him. The first intro riff of a piano version of
          "Pressure" kicks in and the crowd inside goes crazy.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MOLLY (CONT'D)

</b>          Talon walks out into the alley, still holding the flowers.

<b>          
</b>          Close on Kirk - looking dapper but sweaty and nervous.

                    You may now...
<b>          
</b>          A wider shot reveals the NASCAR theme wedding of Eric and
          Debbie. Kirk stands among the groomsmen. Each are dressed
          in tuxes that represent the colors, numbers and sponsors of
          certain drivers. Molly stands among the bridesmaids. Each
          dressed in a checkered-flag gown. Ron and Marnie are also in
          the wedding party.
<b>          
</b>          Debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and
          Eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss. Debbie
          grabs Eric's ass while Eric gropes her breasts.
<b>          
</b>          Stainer and Wheel in the Sky kick into "Any Way You Want It"
          from a bandstand nearby. Patty dances in front of Stainer -
          he winks back at her.
<b>          
</b>          Devon cuts up a wedding cake that looks like a full-sized
          racing wheel and tire.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. WEDDING - STREET
</b><b>          
</b>          The guests throw rice as Eric and Debbie run to a stretch
          Nascar limo.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 110.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Eric picks up Debbie and loads her in through the window.   He
          then runs around to the other side and jumps into that
          window. The limo burns rubber as it peels away.
<b>          
</b>          Pan across the guests as they wave goodbye; Devon and his
          squeaky clean family, Jack and a hot date, Mr. & Mrs.
          Kettner, Marnie & Ron. Patty and Stainer - making out. Kirk
          and Molly stand together arm in arm. Kirk holds a ceramic
          urn, painted with the Las Vegas skyline.
<b>          
</b>          Push in on the urn until the skyline becomes real. Push in
          toward the top of The Stratosphere Casino. Continue pushing
          in until we are inside the observation deck. Push through
          the gift shop where the TV is tuned to CNN. As we pass the
          TV we hear.

</b>                    In a press conference held earlier
                    today, NASA officials announced
                    that affordable tourist travel to
                    the surface of the moon will be a
                    reality within the next ten to
                    fifteen years.
<b>          
</b>          Push past the TV, out of the gift shop and to the other side
          of the observation deck where we find Kirk and Molly. They
          kiss before they open the urn and pour Grammy's ashes over
          the side.
