<b>          EXT. PARK - DAY
</b>

<b>          
</b>          We float down through a serene, leafy park to the
          children's play area. There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL
          FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids.

</b>                    I have a theory about how this all
                    started...

<b>          
</b>          A SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little
          girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle.

<b>          
</b>          And then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE

<b>          LITTLE GIRL DOWN.
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 LITTLE GIRL
</b>                    Why did you do that?

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 LITTLE BOY
</b>                    Because you smell like dog poo.

<b>          
</b>          Some of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one-
          liner. Our little girl's face turns red.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
</b>                    You're so stupid just like dog poo!
                    You're made of poo!

<b>          
</b>          And then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE,
          smashing it. Finally, our little girl starts to CRY.

                    did those things? And said those things?

<b>          
</b>          The little girl shakes her head no.

                    Where did that rumor start? Because moms

</b>                    That little boy is doing those terrible
                    things because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.

<b>          
</b>          We see our little girl take this in, like she is just now
          beginning to understand the ways of the world.

</b>                    Do you understand what this means? We
                    are all encouraged to believe that if a
                    guy acts like a total jerk -- that means
                    he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that
                    might serve us as five year olds, but
                    many of us keep believing this advice
                    well into adulthood.

<b>          
</b>          ANNA, hot in an earthy sort of way, heads down the aisle.
          She holds her cell phone in one hand - a BOTTLED WATER
          and a BAG OF SOY NUTS in the other.

<b>                                 ANNA
</b>                    Conor, that's so nice.     Thank you.

<b>          
</b>          As Anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of
          her. He looks back to see her - he's BEN, good looking
          and supremely likeable. They share a smile.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 BEN

                    Hold on.

<b>

<b>                                 ANNA (CONT'D)

</b>                    Well, technically it's six. And I'm
                    still mulling over a gum purchase. So...

<b>          
</b>          He steps aside to let her go.   She smiles.

<b>          
</b>          She hands the cashier her ATM card - he swipes it.

<b>

          finding what he was looking for.

<b>          
</b>          The cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an
          IGLOO COOLER and hands it to Anna. She BEAMS.

</b>

<b>          
</b>          Neil walks into a vast space. Nice art, a cozy yet
          architectural look - a cool place to live.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                   NEIL
</b>                    Hey, babe.    You here?

<b>          
</b>          We PAN over to a couch - where BETH is wrapped in a throw
          blanket, watching TV. She's got her hair in a messy bun.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                  BETH
</b>                    Hey honey.

<b>          
</b>          He joins her on the couch.        And sees that the TV is off.

<b>                                  BETH
</b>                    Yeah.   Just got off the phone.

<b>          
</b>          Neil gets up again.

<b>

<b>                                 NEIL
</b>                    You want some tea or something?

</b>
<b>                                 BETH
</b>                    It was my baby sister.        She's getting
                    married.

                    Devon guy. That's really great.

<b>          
</b>          Beth looks at him.    She doesn't look that happy.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 BETH

<b>                                   NEIL
</b>                    Yeah.

</b>
<b>                                 BETH
</b>                    So, you think it's great that they're
                    getting married, but you never feel like
                    we're going against nature or something
                    by not getting married?

<b>

<b>                                   NEIL
</b>                    No, babe.

<b>          
</b>          He sits back down, puts his arms around her.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 NEIL (CONT'D)
</b>                    Going against nature is like that cat who
                    started nursing that monkey. We're just
                    two people who aren't married.

<b>          
</b>          Beth manages a weak smile.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                   BETH
</b>                    Right.

</b>
<b>                                 NEIL
</b>                    I actually think the odds of having a
                    successful relationship increase by not
                    getting married. Look at my parents -
                    all marriage got them was thirty two
                    years of misery and joint checking.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 BETH
</b>                    Yeah, I know. I get that.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 NEIL
</b>                    Like I've always told you - I love you -
                    and we don't need a marriage certificate
                    to legitimize our relationship.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                   BETH
</b>                    Yeah.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 NEIL
</b>                    Lemme get you some tea.

<b>          EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING
</b>

<b>          
</b>          A brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood -
          clearly under massive renovation.

<b>          INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - SAME
</b>

<b>          
</b>          We make our way through rooms with plastic covering the
          doorways - until we find JANINE stepping into the
          hallway. She checks herself in a vintage mirror,
          straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find
          GIGI, on her cell phone. Gigi slams it closed.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 JANINE
</b>                    OK, so clearly he hasn't called.

<b>          
</b>          Gigi shakes her head.

<b>                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
</b>                    Maybe he's away on business.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    He sells real estate. In Baltimore.
                    Staying in town is his business.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                    JANINE
</b>                    Right.

<b>          
</b>          Janine ponders this.

<b>

<b>                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
</b>                    Look, let me tell you - after the first
                    time I went out with Ben, he didn't call
                    me for eleven days. ELEVEN DAYS. And
                    now he's like the world's best husband.
                    That happens all the time.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                    GIGI

<b>                                    JANINE
</b>                    Yes, really.

<b>          
</b>          Gigi manages a small smile.

<b>                                 GIGI

</b>
<b>                                 JANINE
</b>                    No - you asked if I knew any guys and I
                    gave Conor your number. That's not a set
                    up. When I do a set up - I weigh pros
                    and cons. I do my due diligence. All I
                    know about Conor is he sold us this
                    house.

<b>          
</b>          Gigi peers out the window.

<b>

<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    He sold you a house in the ghetto.

<b>                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
</b>                    Seriously, stop.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    He said he always hangs at Red Maple
                    after work. Maybe I should do a little
                    drive-by?

<b>          FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:   ...IF HE'S NOT CALLING YOU
</b>
<b>          
</b>          AMBER, pretty if a little thick in the middle, sits in
          the courtyard of an office park in her work clothes.

</b>
<b>                                 AMBER
</b>                    Caller ID was the worst thing that's ever
                    happened to me. Total invasion of my
                    personal freedom. When a guy doesn't
                    call me, it is my right - my duty even -
                    to call him and hang up several thousand
                    times. Or at least until his mother
                    shouts at me in Albanian and blows a
                    police whistle into the phone. I mean,
                    calling and hanging up is an age old
                    expression of love and frustration and
                    too many wine coolers - and who is AT&
                    f'ing T to take that away from me?

                    ban me from sitting in my car in front of
                    a guy's house, blaring "Where Is Your
                    Heart" by Kelly Clarkson until his new
                    stupid girlfriend comes outside and
                    threatens to scratch my eyes out with her
                    acrylics. I mean, a girl deserves

                       forget he was supposed to meet you?

                       that was kind of a broad term, kind of a
                       wide interpretation of the word "meeting"-

                    mean, I actually was just - in the area -
                    so I figured I'd just swing by and see if

                    left this. So, I thought I should really
                    return it before he - you know -
                           (conspiratorially to Alex)

<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    I think I figured it out. Remember when
                    I went out with that notary public? And
                    he cheated on me? And then Anastasia
                    from upstairs told us that story about
                    how her boyfriend cheated on her at the
                    beginning - but then he totally changed

<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    No, notary. Anyway, the point is -
                    Anastasia is the exception. Not the
                    rule. We have to stop listening to these
                    stories - because the rule is that most
                    guys who cheat on you up front don't

                    in his storage space. He only used me
                    for rides, yet I continued to stalk him
                    for most of 1998. Then there was Don,
                    who broke up with me every Friday so he
                    could have his weekends free. I was so
                    delusional about our relationship that I
                    referred to him as my husband to random
                    people like my dental hygenist.

                    about how things might work out with
                    these dipshits because they knew someone
                    who knew someone who dated a dipshit just
                    like mine, and that girl ended up getting
                    married and living happily ever after.

</b>                    OK. So let me see if I understand. What
                    you're saying is that when people tell me
                    about some girl they know who dated a guy
                    for thirteen years, and then he finally
                    married her -- that's the exception. And
                    the rule is that guys - like Neil - who
                    are with girls - like me - for seven
                    years without getting married - are never
                    getting married.

</b>                    It is impossible not to like this guy.
                    I'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting
                    with me outside Eddie's, and then he
                    tells me he's married. You'd think I'd
                    be pissed, but I literally could not stop
                    myself from liking him.

</b>                    I realize that. I keep trying to force
                    myself to picture him in some church
                    saying vows to some woman, and even that
                    doesn't cool it off. What is my problem?

</b>                    OK. There was this guy who worked in my
                    dad's printing business. Married for
                    fifteen years to a nice lady. And then
                    he meets this woman at some church event.
                    And he told my dad he just had never felt
                    anything like it before. I mean, he had
                    finally met the love of his life. So, he
                    divorced his wife, and he's been with
                    this other woman for 22 years and they
                    are blissfully happy. I mean, what if
                    you meet the love of your life - but you
                    already married someone else? Are you
                    supposed to pass them by?

                    that. Said he'd eventually get me a

                    concept: it involves dating a girl from
                    the time she's thirty two to the time
                    she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her
                    of the ability to bear children, and
                    then, after all that, wanting to take a
                    year off. And giving it a fun name that
                    you can put on t-shirts.
                           (looks at the baby, smiles)
                    I left him.

                    But I offered to help you with your
                    career, and I don't see why I can't do
                    that, right? So, give me a call. Maybe
                    you can come by the office this week or

                   pen.

<b>                               ALEX

<b>                                GIGI
</b>                   I'm really sorry to bug you. I just - I
                   thought you had some really good insights
                   the other night and -- I had a question.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                ALEX
</b>                   Okay, maybe I need to be harsh -- Conor
                   is never going to be interested in you.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                GIGI
</b>                   No, I know. This is about -
                          (she looks at the card)
                   - Jarrad. You have a sec?

<b>                               ALEX
</b>                   Okay...

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                GIGI
</b>                   So I meet him at happy hour and he was
                   completely charming --

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                ALEX
</b>                   Lemme guess - he said the only thing
                   happy about this hour is you.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                GIGI
</b>                   He may have used some derivative of that.
                   So, he says he's going to call, but then
                   gave me his card and --

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                ALEX
</b>                   He's not interested.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                GIGI
</b>                   You don't even know if he called --

<b>          
</b>
<b>                               ALEX
</b>                   Did he?

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                GIGI
</b>                   No. But the thing is, I honestly think
                   he's expecting my call.

</b>                    He said "Look forward to hearing from
                    you" and not "Look forward to talking to

                    giving me shit for not wearing a white

<b>

                    instead of taking yours, he's not
                    interested.

</b>
<b>                                 GIGI

</b>
<b>                                 ALEX
</b>                    And, if a guy wants to see you, he will
                    see you. I once called 55 Lauren Bell's

<b>          EXT. DUNDALK HOME - BACKYARD - DAY
</b>

<b>          
</b>          CLOSE ON:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM written across a CAKE.

<b>          
</b>          As the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna
          and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny
          backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom.

<b>          
</b>          As Maya refills her glass from a BOTTLE OF WINE, Anna
          grabs a GIFT from her bag - hands it to her mom.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                   MAYA
</b>                      Oh sweetie - you didn't have to get me
                      anything.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                   ANNA
</b>                      Mom - you always say that and I always
                      get you something.

<b>          
</b>          Maya takes a BIG SIP OF WINE (not her first) as she tears
          open the gift, which is clearly a RECORD ALBUM.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                     MAYA
</b>                      You didn't.

</b>
<b>                                   ANNA
</b>                      It's no big deal.

<b>          
</b>          Maya shows him the album - TIM BUCKLEY'S STARSAILOR.

<b>                                 MAYA
</b>                    We met at a coffee shop in 1971. Hell's
                    Kitchen. I had no idea who he was. But
                    he had this big mop of hair and these
                    eyes that just looked past you and
                    through you and into you all at the same
                    time. Complete interest and disinterest.
                    It was amazing.

<b>          
</b>          Maya pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

</b>                    Of course, I was with Anna's father at
                    the time, so, you know...another
                    opportunity missed.

                           (to Conor)
                    Have you seen the pictures of me from
                    when I was Anna's age?

<b>                                 CONOR
</b>                    Umm - I don't think so -

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 MAYA
</b>                    Sweetie go get that picture - you know
                    the one -

<b>          
</b>          Anna just looks at her - pleadingly.

<b>                                 MAYA (CONT'D)
</b>                    Go. Your mother's asking you to do
                    something for her on her birthday.

<b>          
</b>          Anna goes inside.   Maya looks to Conor, takes a sip.

<b>

<b>                                 MAYA (CONT'D)
</b>                    You'll see - we look strikingly similar.
                    My lips may be a bit fuller, but...

<b>          
</b>          She leans back, puts out her cigarette as Anna returns
          with A PICTURE. She hands it to Conor.

<b>          
</b>          INSERT: MAYA, in her early twenties. Black and white -
          somewhere in New York. The resemblance to Anna is scary.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 MAYA
</b>                    So that's what we're dealing with here,
                    for reference. Imagine meeting someone
                    who looks like that in a coffee shop.

<b>          
</b>          Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna.

</b>
<b>                                 CONOR
</b>                    That's funny, because, I mean, I guess I
                    kinda did. Anna and I met at a
                    restaurant. That serves coffee. So, not
                    a coffee shop, but...still -

<b>          
</b>          He looks from Maya to Anna.     Maya stands up.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 MAYA
</b>                    That's sweet. But if we're comparing
                    stories -
                           (indicating with her glass)
                    She's no me - and you're no Tim Buckley.

<b>          
</b>          With that, Maya heads inside.

<b>                                 MAYA (CONT'D)
</b>                    Anyone need a refill?

<b>          
</b>          Anna looks to Conor apologetically.    He just smiles.

<b>          FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:...IF HE/SHE'S NOT SLEEPING WITH YOU
</b>
<b>          
</b>          TRENT, early 30s, talks to the camera as he drives his
          Ford Explorer. He's cute - but trying a smidge too hard -
          - goatee, leather cord necklace he bought in Cancun, etc.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 TRENT
</b>                    If a girl is into you, she's sleeping
                    with you. And if after a month - two
                    months at the very outside - she's not
                    sleeping with you, she does not like you.
                    I guess the trick is, how to spot this
                    girl early - so you don't waste the one
                    to seven weeks waiting to find out that
                    it's never gonna happen. So, I've got
                    some signs about how to spot this girl -
                    gleaned from my own experience, of
                    course. A girl will never sleep with you
                    if: she calls you cuddly or dependable,
                    she pops a zit in front of you, her name
                    is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump
                    in your bathroom or she takes home
                    leftovers in dates 1-3. I know it's not
                    scientific - but I'm just saying - you
                    were warned.

                    than some people. Big deal. You never
                    did anything the way every one else did
                    it, and that's what I've always thought
                    was so great about you.

                    only one not married. If this was
                    Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to
                    sacrifice me or something.

                    going to camp at the Y, you borrowed my
                    New York Times, found some arts camp in
                    the Berkshires, wrote away for
                    information, then got accepted on your
                    own. You were nine. You never did
                    things the way everyone else did.

<b>                                JAVIER
</b>                    No, ma'am. My guys don't smoke on the
                    job site. They're all good guys.

                    around here? And smoking? And lying to

</b>                    I need you to be honest with me, Javier.
                    Because I can't have someone lying to me.

<b>          
</b>          TWO WELL BUILT MEN (SKIP and LARRY) sip from bottles of

                    used to sleep together - all the time.

                    said that, it wasn't all the time. But
                    it did happen - I know I'm not making
                    this up. And then, out of nowhere, it
                    stops. But she still calls, she stops
                    by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a
                    massage, she leaves cute messages - but
                    it never goes ANYWHERE. I mean, what is

                    straight, you're not going to get
                    anywhere by being inactive. She clearly
                    likes you - maybe she just wants you to
                    be a man and do something. So the next
                    time you're in the position - don't take
                    no for an answer.

                    married with kids and running a tanning
                    salon on Staten Island. But if she
                    wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd
                    like to tell a lot of the girls that come
                    in and out of this building on the arm of
                    a married guy.

</b>                    And here is that advice --- get stocks,
                    cash, annuities, a deed in your name.
                    Don't settle for flowers and a shopping
                    spree at Bendel's. Think to the future.
                    We all know that none of these guys is
                    gonna leave his society wife and let her
                    keep half the money and the classic eight
                    on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these
                    young ladies, as long as you only have
                    the guy for a finite period of time --
                    get something that can last. Because I
                    guarantee you - he won't. And that's the
                    best fatherly advice I can give.

                    then I text him to his cell and then he
                    emails me to my home account from the
                    plane phone -- and it just totally gets
                    out of hand. I miss the days where you
                    had one phone number with one answering
                    machine that housed one cassette tape and
                    either the cassette tape had a message
                    from the guy or it didn't. That's it.
                    Now you have to go around checking all
                    your portals and get rejected by seven

                    Bill character - and the two of us
                    basically have a date. And then he calls

</b>          The lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the-

          begun. TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS start things off.

</b>          Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with

<b>          
</b>          Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort
          - BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow
          tie. Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy -
          who stops to piss on a chair leg. Beth is not happy.

</b>

<b>          
</b>          A PARTY is in full swing. Typical affair for someone in
          their late 20's - mediocre food but decent alcohol.

<b>          
</b>          Gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix.
          She tries smiling at a TALL GIRL, who ignores her. So
          Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls
          of Chex Mix into her mouth.

</b>
<b>                                 NATHAN

<b>                                   GIGI
</b>                    Pardon?

<b>          
</b>          Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay
          coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday
          night gay mode - standing next to her.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 NATHAN
</b>                    Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I
                    made out with a guy after eating like a
                    bag of the stuff. He said my breath
                    smelled like trout.

<b>          
</b>          Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 GIGI

</b>                    I hope - I mean I'm pretty sure -
                    something is about to happen between us.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 NATHAN

                    his date?

</b>
<b>                                 BRUCE
</b>                    I hate that - when you don't know if
                    you're a date - so you don't know if you
                    should bring a friend, or if you're like
                    co-hosting or if you should stay til the
                    end to have alone time --

<b>          
</b>          Suddenly, a look of DOUBT sweeps across Gigi's face.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    He didn't really say.

<b>          
</b>          She reflexively GRABS FOR THE CHEX MIX and starts gorging
          on it again. Nathan stops her.

<b>

<b>                                 GIGI (CONT'D)

<b>          
</b>          Beth's dad gives Beth a wink as she heads onto to the
          dance floor with DOMINIC, 50s and fat.

          they are distracted by a COMMOTION ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

<b>

                    more liquor. But it looks like the food
                    could use some refreshing --

<b>          
</b>          The party is now even more crowded. Gigi weaves her way
          through the crowd. She's deftly holding SIX DRINKS,
          passing them off to various people as she walks.

<b>          
</b>          She stops at the food table, rearranges a few bowls.

<b>          
</b>          She CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to
          friends. She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP. He gives an
          awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation.

<b>

</b>
<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have
                    a party, I was like "Let's do it."

</b>                    No problem.   Anytime.

<b>          
</b>          An attractive TALL GIRL enters the kitchen, and starts
          LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. Gigi watches with interest.

<b>

<b>                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
</b>                    Can I help you find something?

<b>          
</b>          The Tall Girl finds a BOWL in the cabinet, and grabs it.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 TALL GIRL
</b>                    No, that's OK. I got it.

<b>          
</b>          She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts
          emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl. Gigi is THROWN.

</b>                    Alex asked me to get the dip together.
                    Thanks for getting it started.

<b>          
</b>          Gigi's face grows red.   The Tall Girl tastes the dip.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 TALL GIRL (CONT'D)
</b>                    Hmmm - could use a little more dill.

<b>          
</b>          Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and
          heads back out to the party. Gigi looks to the confused
          party-goers, not pleased.

</b>          Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave. People are
          getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning.

<b>          
</b>          Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline.

<b>

</b>                    When someone's underwear ends up in your

<b>          
</b>          Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 ALEX
</b>                    I guess people had fun.

<b>          
</b>          Then, the TALL GIRL emerges.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 TALL GIRL
</b>                    Alex, you want me to start cleaning up?

<b>          
</b>          Gigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd
                    stick around, so I'll take care of it.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                  TALL GIRL
</b>                    No.   I got it.

<b>          
</b>          The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a
          trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified.

<b>          
</b>          It is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL
          GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on
          the XBOX. Gigi enters from the kitchen.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 GIGI
</b>                    I think I've rounded up the last of the
                    beer bottles.

<b>          
</b>          The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game.
          Gigi stands there awkwardly.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
</b>                    So, umm - what game is this?

<b>          
</b>          They ignore her.   She looks around.    It's awkward.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
</b>                    Well, maybe I should just -- you know --
                    I mean it's past three and --

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                   TALL GIRL
</b>                    YES!!    Suck it!

<b>          
</b>          Alex tosses down his controller.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 ALEX
</b>                    You are sensational.

<b>          
</b>          The tall girl beams.   Gigi flinches.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 TALL GIRL
</b>                    Did you say it's past three?     Man, I
                    gotta go.

<b>          
</b>          Gigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug,
          and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next
          to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 ALEX
</b>                    Thanks for staying and helping clean up
                    - but I really gotta get to bed.

<b>          
</b>          But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is
          LUNGING at him. She puts his face in her hands, and
          starts to KISS HIM. REALLY KISS HIM. Finally, Gigi
          pulls away. She looks breathless.

</b>          Alex looks a little afraid.

<b>

<b>                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
</b>                    I knew it. I knew it. The best
                    relationships grow out of friendships.

<b>          
</b>          She goes in to kiss him again.   This time he stops her.

                    relationship station--ship, we're at
                    least on the track.

                    but at least that means I still care.
                    You think you've won because women are

</b>                    Hey Janine, I'm sorry it's so late, but I
                    just - don't start picking out your
                    bridesmaid dress, OK? I know this isn't
                    the first time this has happened, it's
                    just - this one wasn't about whether he
                    liked me. I just really liked him.

<b>                                 MARIEL
</b>                    My first husband was unimpressive. I
                    found him in bed with his big breasted
                    secretary when I came home early from the
                    Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel
                    sorry for him. My second husband was a
                    pinch more creative. Cheated on me with
                    my sister - but made me believe that I
                    was insane for being suspicious. At last
                    - some intrigue, some mind games - though
                    my sister's two year old eventually gave
                    them up. But my last husband -- he was a
                    gem. A veritable master at covering his
                    tracks. I poured over his phone records,
                    intercepted his credit card bills, had
                    him followed on countless occasions - and
                    never found a single shred of evidence.
                    It wasn't until he died that I found out
                    about the property he owned with his
                    Austrian mistress. But the real master,
                    I have to say -- is me. Three husbands --
                    countless boyfriends, and I haven't been
                    caught yet.

<b>          
</b>          Ben deftly shuts and locks the door behind them.

</b>
<b>                                 ANNA
</b>                    I cannot believe this. He liked my demo.
                    Did you hear what he said? When he said
                    it was hauntingly beautiful? Did you
                    hear that part?

<b>

</b>                    Yep.    I was sitting right there.

<b>          
</b>          Ben smiles, and pulls Anna to him.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                    ANNA
</b>                    Thank you.     Thank you so much.

<b>          
</b>          With that, they start to KISS. It gets heated. CLOTHES
          START TO COME OFF. MOSTLY ANNA'S. They make their way
          over to the LEATHER SOFA.

</b>                    How is it that every time I see your
                    body, I'm shocked at how beautiful it is?

<b>          
</b>          Anna smiles at the compliment. She starts to work on his
          shirt when: SOMEONE TRIES TO OPEN THE LOCKED DOOR.

<b>          
</b>          Ben continues to remove his shirt as he talks.

<b>          
</b>          BEN FREEZES.    Literally freezes on top of Anna.

<b>          
</b>          Ben FRANTICALLY puts his hands over Anna's mouth. Then,
          working with speed and precision, he GATHERS ALL OF
          ANNA'S THINGS and shoves her - NAKED - into the CLOSET.
          There isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit. She
          looks up at Ben, he closes the closet door.

<b>          
</b>          He goes to the door of the office.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                BEN
</b>                    Shit. I told Dana to get this lock
                    fixed. One sec.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 JANINE
</b>                    Why do you even lock it?

<b>          
</b>          Ben re-buttons his shirt, gives the office a once over.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 BEN
</b>                    I'd never get anything done if I didn't.

<b>          
</b>          Finally, Ben opens the door, and Janine is standing
          there, smiling.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 JANINE
</b>                    Can I come in?

</b>
<b>                                 BEN
</b>                    Of course.

<b>          
</b>          She makes a show of CLOSING AND LOCKING THE DOOR.

<b>

<b>                                 BEN (CONT'D)

<b>                                 JANINE

<b>          
</b>          Ben goes to sit behind his desk, confused.

<b>                                 BEN
</b>
<b>                    OK.
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at
          his desk chair. Her skirt is way too long to do this, so
          she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt. Ben glances
          over at the closet.

<b>                                 BEN (CONT'D)

<b>          
</b>          Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up.

</b>
<b>                                 JANINE

</b>          Anna sits, holding back tears, as she listens closely.

</b>

<b>          
</b>          Alex has the staff (of about 10) assembled for the pre-
          shift meeting. He consults a clipboard as he talks.

<b>

<b>                                 ALEX

<b>          
</b>          The staff looks at each other - perplexed.

<b>          
</b>          Alex rifles through his papers, not sure what he's
          looking for. He slams his clipboard on the bar.

</b>          The group voice their opinions - a resounding "NO".

<b>          
</b>          The group disperses, Alex heads around the bar.   He sees
          Kelli Ann walking away and calls after her.

                    not a lot of phone traffic.

<b>          
</b>          Kelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his
          cell phone, look at it, then put it down. He grabs a
          beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again -
          staring at it, willing it to ring. He puts it down
          again. A HUGE SMILE grows on Kelli Ann's face.

<b>          
</b>          Anna stands in the cluttered kitchen of her mom's house.
          She writes out a CHECK, leaves it on the counter. She
          looks to the living room, where Maya sleeps on the couch.
          She watches her for a second, struggling with a blanket,
          before heading over to her. She crouches next to the
          couch, helps her adjust the blanket.

<b>

<b>                                 ANNA
</b>                    I'm gonna go. I left the check on the
                    counter. It should at least get you

<b>          
</b>          Maya closes her eyes again. Anna sits there, watching
          her. Anna's eyes start to fill with tears - quietly, she
          begins crying. Maya finally notices.

           and walks past them to the kitchen. The guys are annoyed

           the last of the dishes. He turns around. It's NEIL.

                     load of laundry still drying, but the
                     other one is folded on top of the washer.

           Where there once were plastic sheets there are now walls

<b>

           though full of furniture, the longer she stands there,

           around the room, not sure what to do with herself.

<b>          
</b>           She notices a pair of pants and jacket thrown over a
           chair - goes to tidy it up. She picks up the jacket,
           checks the pockets, they're empty. She grabs the pants,
           takes them both to the walk-in closet. She hangs up the
           jacket. And as she folds the pants over - she HEARS
           SOMETHING HIT THE GROUND. She looks down to find -

<b>          
</b>           A PACK OF CIGARETTES. Her face pales. She stares at it -

           and, not satisfied, rushes back up the stairs.

<b>

           herself in the ANTIQUE MIRROR hanging in the hallway.

<b>          
</b>           Without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and
           SMASHES IT on the ground. She stands over it, breathing
           heavily, looking at the shattered glass.

<b>

           and when she looks up - Neil's down ON ONE KNEE.

<b>

</b>                     I love you so much. So much. I want to
                     make you happy. I need to make you happy
                     for me to even have a shot at being
                     happy, too.

<b>          
</b>           Tears stream down Beth's face.      Neil pops open the box,
           revealing an ENGAGEMENT RING.

<b>

           for a long moment. And then:

                        myself at a safe distance from these
