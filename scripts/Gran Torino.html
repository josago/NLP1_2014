<b>          INT. CHURCH
</b>
          We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance
          are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored
          teenagers.
          WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He
          speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.

<b>          OLDER MAN
</b>          I'm real sorry about Dorothy,
          Walt. She was a real peach.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Thanks for coming, Al.
          Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue
          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
          Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his
          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
          Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
          his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his
          GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus Christ.
          Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from
          across the pews.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Look at the Old Man glaring at
          Ashley. He can't even tone it
          down at Mom's funeral?

<b>          STEVE
</b>          What do you expect? Dad's still
          living in the ‘50s. He expects
          his granddaughter to dress a
          little more modestly.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Yeah, well your kid's wearing a
          Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad
          appreciates that.

<b>          STEVE
</b>          My point is that there's nothing
          anyone can do that won't
          disappoint the Old Man.

</b>          It's inevitable. That's why we
          stopped doing Thanksgivings; the
          deal with the boat motor, the
          broken bird bath, it's always
          something.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          What are we going to do with him?
          Don't you think he'll get in
          trouble by himself over in the old
          neighborhood?

<b>          STEVE
</b>          Why don't you have him move in
          with you?

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ha ha.

<b>          INT. CHURCH - LATER
</b>

          The choir sings the Beatitudes.
          Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
          one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes
          and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish.
          FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up
          to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife.
          Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak,
          unconvincing words of Father Janovich.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Death... is often a bittersweet
          occasion to us Catholics. Bitter
          in the pain it causes the deceased
          ... and their families. Sweet to
          those who know the salvation that
          awaits them. And some may ask,
          what is death. Is it the end? Or
          is it the beginning? And what is
          life? What is this thing we call
          life?

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus.
          Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
          He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white
          cloth.

</b>
          The house is crammed with people following the service.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to
          keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.

<b>          STEVE
</b>          A lot of people showed up after
          the service.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew
          there'd be plenty of ham. I think
          I'll go downstairs and get some
          more chairs.

<b>          STEVE
</b>          I'll do it, Dad.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Naw, we need them now, not next
          week.

<b>          INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME

          Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in
          the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed
          through.

          Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT
          looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are
          sprawled dead on the ground.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Is that Dad?

<b>          DANIEL
</b>          No, it's Grandpa Walt.
          Josh turns the photo over and reads it...

<b>          JOSH
</b>          ‘Third Platoon, E company, March
          second, 1952, Korea.'

<b>          DANIEL
</b>          Where's Korea?

<b>          JOSH
</b>          Hell if I know?
          David holds up a MEDAL.

          They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt
          descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch,
          pretending to be doing nothing.
          Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.

</b>          People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents,
          KAREN and Mitch.

<b>          ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)
</b>          How long do we have to stay, this
          ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
          and I'm bored.
          Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
          he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and Karen are
          embarrassed.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ashley, honey. Why don't you help
          Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          Me?

<b>          KAREN
</b>          Yes you.

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          Grandpa Walt, can I help you with
          the chairs.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I'll take care of it, you just
          painted your nails.
          Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
          It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks
          relieved to get out of the house.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I'd better salt the sidewalk
          before someone falls and breaks a
          hip.
          Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very,
          very, very old DOG follows him outside.

<b>          6
</b>          Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately
          stops at the boundary of his property.
          The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now
          mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged
          to Polish families.
          Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.
          Walt can see through the window that the living room is
          jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.
          And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full-
          blown, unrepentant racist.
          Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats
          can they cram into a living room?
          Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.

</b>          Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a
          cigarette. She has pulled back the canvas tarp that
          covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO.
          The Gran Torino is in mint condition. It has been babied
          since the day it rolled off the line.
          Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the
          vintage car?
          Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
          burning cigarette before answering.

<b>          WALT
</b>
<b>          1972.
</b>
<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          I never knew you had a cool old
          car.

<b>          WALT
</b>          It's only been in here since
          before you were born.

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          So, what are you like going to do
          with it like, when... you die?
          Walt lights up a smoke --

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
          Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.

<b>          ASHLEY
</b>          Then what about that super cool
          retro couch in the den, I'm going
          to State next year and I don't
          have, like, any furniture?
          Walt walks out without commenting.

<b>          8
</b>          The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing
          there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy. Walt scowls.
          TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very
          good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Who the hell are you?

<b>          TAO
</b>          (very quietly)
          I'm Tao, I live next door.

<b>          WALT
</b>          What?! Speak up, boy, get the
          shit out of your mouth. What do
          you want?

<b>          TAO
</b>          Do you have jumper cables? My
          uncle's car is old and...

<b>          WALT
</b>          No. And have some goddamned
          respect, zipper head, we're
          mourning over here.
          Walt slams the door in Tao's face.
          Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
          Walt hates situations like this.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Huh?

<b>          WALT
</b>          It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife
          and I became quite close these
          last few months. She asked that I
          watch over you when she passed on.
          I told her I watch out for my
          entire flock, but she made me
          promise I'd keep an extra sharp
          eye on you.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I appreciate your kindness to my
          wife and now that you've spoken
          your piece, why don't you move on
          to the next sheep?
          Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Dorothy mentioned specifically
          that it was her wish for you to go
          to confession. She said she
          couldn't remember the last time
          you went.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Is that so?

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          It is.
          Walt drains his lowball glass.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Well, I confess I never much liked
          church and only went because of
          the wife. And I confess I have no
          desire to confess to a boy who is
          fresh out of the seminary.

</b>          People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling,
          stiff-jointed old Pollacks.
          Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
          more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter
          and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy
          bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home.
          The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old
          baby is named and three souls are located for the
          newborn.

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>          Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
          ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables
          to their dead battery.
          Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a
          brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          I'd really like to help, Dad, but
          we have to get the kids home,
          they're getting restless.
          Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
          and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Fine. Go.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          I'll call in a few, see how you're

          Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.

          The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their
          heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
          The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
          It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to

          without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an
          insult.
          In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong “Soul Calling” ceremony
          starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is
          present and begins the ritual.

</b>          A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when --
          WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his
          front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the
          snow.
          A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand
          around the stunned, prone Tao.

<b>          HEAD LATINO
</b>          Whatta you gonna do, gook? You
          gonna ‘Kung Fu' us?
          Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.

<b>          LATINO #2
</b>          Surprised it ain't a girl's bike.
          The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground.

<b>          HEAD LATINO
</b>          You gonna get up or what?
          Tao doesn't move.

<b>          HEAD LATINO
</b>          Tell you what, I'll let you take
          the first swing. You drop me and
          you can have your bike back.
          Tao smiles, he can't help it.

<b>          HEAD LATINO
</b>          What the fuck you smiling at,
          gook? Something funny?
          He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.

<b>          HEAD LATINO
</b>          You better get the fuck outta
          here, bitch.
          He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow.
          This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos.
          The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike.

          Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors'
          houses are rundown.
          Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped
          screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed
          a chicken coop.
          Walt looks down at Daisy --

          finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly
          behind him.
          The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace
          with his step. Tao looks over to the occupants of the
          Chevy.
          It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy
          easily keeps up with Tao.

          Tao laughs, but keeps walking.

<b>          LATINO DRIVER
</b>          That's right, you keep walking.
          Fucking slopes everywhere you
          look, man. Why gooks come up in
          here and fuck up our neighborhood?
          Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big
          SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers.
          The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the
          Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at
          Tao.

<b>          SPIDER
</b>          Dude, that's my little cousin,

          The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL.
          A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays
          a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned.

<b>          LATINO #2
</b>          Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go
          back to your fucking rice paddy.
          The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs
          in the car smile and congratulate themselves.
          Tao simply keeps walking down the street!

</b>          Where the fuck does he think he's
          going? Turn us around and go
          after that cousin of yours.
          They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with
          him as he walks.

          A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a
          cigarette. Tao shakes his head “no” and looks at the
          ground.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          That's exactly the point, Tao.
          Spider told me how everyone thinks

          be kind of a quiet little punk

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          I'd like to think I know a lot.
          I'm a priest.

<b>          WALT
</b>          You stand at the altar and preach
          on and on about life and death
          without knowing anything other
          than what you learned in priest
          school. Everything you say sounds
          like it's out of the Rookie
          Preachers Handbook.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          I don't know about that...

<b>          WALT
</b>          ‘Death is bittersweet? Bitter in
          the pain, sweet in the salvation.'
          That's what you know of life and
          death? Good God, it's pathetic.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

<b>          WALT
</b>          Plenty. I lived with death for
          three years in Korea. We shot
          people, we stabbed them with
          bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year-
          old kids to death with shovels,
          for Christ's sake. I did things
          that won't leave me till the day I
          die, horrible things, things I
          have to live with.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          And what about life?
          Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his
          answer.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Well... I survived the war... got
          married... and raised a family.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Sounds like you know more about
          death than you do living.
          Walt downs a shot.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Maybe so.

          had plenty to drink at the VFW.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Daisy?
          The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at
          the clock; it's 3:48 am.
          Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint
          beam of a flashlight in his garage.

          Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out
          the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea.
          Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and
          chambers a round with a loud SNAP.

<b>          23
</b>          The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face
          to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE.
          Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better
          aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao
          drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud
          metallic clang.
          Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs
          up, Walt advances, step for step.
          Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip.
          They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with
          the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
          As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE
          RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer
          sign on the wall.
          Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
          Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
          Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs
          down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb
          still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Shit.

          Spider's Honda. Spider opens the door.

<b>          SPIDER
</b>          Get in, get in!
          Tao runs right past him. Spider guns the motor and pulls
          in front of Tao. Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger
          get out.

          Smokie, Spider and the other gangbanger grab Tao.

<b>          SPIDER

          you're family and you're with us

<b>          TAO
</b>          He shot at me! I'm out! I'm
          out!!!
          Tao squirms out of Smokie's grasp. Smokie yells at Tao
          as he runs away...

</b>          Me? Nothing. What would I want?

<b>          WALT

</b>          No. I was just wondering how you
          are, what's going on, anything new
          in the old neighborhood?
          Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.

</b>          Nope.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Great. Smooth sailing then?

<b>          WALT

          There's a very painful pause in the conversation.

          shines, the tires look new and the paint is waxed and
          polished.
          Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood
          in defiance. A couple of Hmong teenagers look at the
          car.

<b>          WALT
</b>
<b>          (MUTTERS)

          chair and walks stiffly back into the garage.
          Walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the Gran
          Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway. The
          whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular
          Mechanics.
          Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
          light comes on. The Gran Torino remains in the driveway.
          It's a challenge, an invitation. Walt is daring the
          thief to come back. And Walt's ready this time.

          Sue exchange looks out on the front step.
          Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking
          confidently up the sidewalk towards them. They grin,
          they're cocky.

          gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks
          free.

          Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other
          gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay.
          A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into
          the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their
          pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face
          and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
          Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes
          a pushing, rolling, surging melee.

          carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables.
          Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop.

<b>          WALT
</b>          No. No more.
          The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn
          around.

<b>          NEXT DOOR
</b>          Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard. They gesture
          towards Walt's house. The women buzz around Tao, all
          speaking in his ear at the same time.
          Phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her.
          Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his
          house. Tao looks like a whipped dog.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Why won't these people leave me
          alone?
          Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts
          up his hands, indicating they've come far enough.
          Sue holds up a plant.

<b>          SUE
</b>          We brought you some shallots to
          plant in your garden.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I don't want them.

<b>          SUE
</b>          They're perennials, they come back
          every year.

<b>          WALT
</b>          No. You keep them. Why do you
          people keep giving me all this
          garbage?
          Sue is a little taken aback.

          Tao's mother speaks rapidly in Hmong to Sue. They look
          at Tao and then to Walt.

</b>          Good afternoon, Walt.
          Walt's eyes narrow.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          I mean, Mr. Kowalski.

</b>          Not that it's any of your
          goddamned business, but when
          things happen quickly like that,
          you have to react. In Korea, we
          never ‘called the police' when a
          swarm of screaming gooks came
          pouring into our lines. We
          reacted.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
          Walt says nothing.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          I've been thinking about our
          discussion on life and death.
          About what you said. About how
          you carry around the horrible
          things you were forced to do.
          Horrible things that won't leave
          you. It seems that it would do
          you good to unload some of that
          burden. Things done during war
          are terrible, being ordered to
          kill, killing to save others,
          killing to save yourself. You're
          right, those are things I don't
          know anything about. But I do
          know about forgiveness. And I've
          seen a lot of men who have
          confessed their sins, admitted
          their guilt and left their burdens
          behind them. Stronger men than
          you. Men at war who were ordered
          to do appalling things and are now
          at peace.
          Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I'm impressed. You came with your
          guns loaded, for once.

<b>          FATHER JANOVICH
</b>          Thank you.

<b>          WALT
</b>          You have balls, Father. And what
          you said, you're right. I'm sure
          stronger men than me have found
          their salvation. Hallelujah. But
          there's one thing you're way wrong
          about.

          backwards.
          They walk past three BLACK GUYS leaning against a
          building. The TALL BLACK GUY spots Sue and smiles.

<b>          TALL BLACK GUY
</b>          Hey, girl, you come over here and
          talk to me. Come on, baby, don't
          be shy.
          Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can
          to avoid the black guys. They try to ignore them.

<b>          TALL BLACK GUY
</b>          Come on, sweetie, don't be like

          the three black guys who block their path.
          One black guy flips Trey's VISOR onto the ground. The
          Tall Guy makes “kissy faces” at Sue as he touches his
          crotch.
          Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt
          solves every situation by being aggressive.
          Walt drives off, then makes a U-turn.
          The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey.

          Trey puts up his hand to “hi-five.” The Tall Black Guy

          Walt is quiet for few seconds.

          Next door, Phong sits watching Walt. He can see her
          mumbling under her breath.

          Walt lights up a cigarette and exhales.
          Walt watches as the only white woman on the block
          struggles to unload her groceries from her car. One of

          bought birthday cake sits in front of Walt.
          Walt reads his birthday card. It's signed; Love Mitch,
          Karen, Ashley and Josh. ALL the signatures have been
          written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen.
          Mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to Walt.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Go ahead, Dad. Open it.

<b>          WALT
</b>          What is it?

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Just open it.
          Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool --
          the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up
          objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc.
          Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          It's a Gopher. It's so you can
          reach stuff. You know, it makes
          things easier.

<b>          KAREN
</b>          Here's one from me.

          hard your whole life. Maybe you
          should think about taking it a
          little easier?
          Walt lights up a cigarette.

</b>          And that's another thing, Dad.
          You should get rid of the coffin

          gone, it's got to be a lot to

          It's worse than Walt thought. He puffs smoke.

          have to worry about mowing the

          Mitch screeches the tires as they take off. Walt waits

          with a can of Pabst.
          Daisy comes out and lies at his feet.
          Walt covers his mouth as he coughs. A dime-sized circle

          Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. The Shaman
          watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the
          head.
          Walt looks pale. He's been spooked good. He wipes sweat
          from his forehead.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Excuse me.
          Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. He takes
          several deep breaths. He's pretty shook up.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Je -- zuz -- Christ.
          Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying
          on.
          Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder.
          Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and
          offer tea and cookies from a tray.
          Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom.
          Walt coughs hard. He wipes blood from his lips. Sue
          comes in and looks at Walt.

<b>          SUE
</b>          Are you okay?
          Walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom.

</b>          Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands.
          He's still pale. He looks long and hard in the mirror.
          Walt is stunned, it all adds up. Walt hasn't really
          lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let
          his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953.

          Walt opens the bathroom door. Sue stands there with a
          concerned look on her face.

<b>          SUE

<b>          WALT
</b>          Me? I'm fine.

</b>          Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great
          delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's
          obviously never tasted before.
          Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food,
          occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This
          corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong
          ladies.
          Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt.

<b>          SUE
</b>          Come on, you glutton, let's go
          downstairs.

<b>          WALT

</b>          Walt and Sue descend the stairway. Walt is really out of
          his element down with all the Hmong teenagers.
          And the first person he sees across the room is Tao.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Oh great.

<b>          SUE
</b>          Well, look who's over there.

<b>          WALT
</b>          What's-his-name who tried to steal
          my Gran Torino.

<b>          SUE
</b>          My brother Tao.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Yeah, Toad.
          Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks
          over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans
          against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles.
          Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the
          dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the
          machine.
          He just can't help it.
          All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
          this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
          dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the
          headlights.

<b>          WALT
</b>          It was wobbly, but I fixed it.
          It's fine now, shouldn't wobble
          anymore.
          The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with
          their hands.
          Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from
          his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink.

<b>          WALT
</b>          What's this?

<b>          WALT
</b>          Alright.
          Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the
          interaction between the boys and girls.
          One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL
          stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her,
          but then looks away.
          The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her
          hair.
          Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
          They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not
          interested, she keeps looking at Tao.
          Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this
          wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to
          Walt.
          She smiles --

<b>          WA XAM (GIRL)

          Walt comes over to Tao, who is startled. Walt laughs.

</b>          It's a perfect job for you, plus
          you people don't seem to mind
          squinting in the sun all day.

</b>          Walt waters a flower bed. Tao comes over and stands
          there. Walt finishes watering before even looking at
          Tao.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What do you have for me today?
          You want me to watch paint dry or
          maybe count the clouds that pass
          by?

<b>          WALT
</b>          Don't get flip with me, zipper
          head. I ain't the one who tried
          to steal and don't forget it.

<b>          TAO
</b>          Go ahead. I don't care if you
          insult me and say racist things.
          I'll take it.

<b>          WALT
</b>          That I know. You have no teeth,
          kid. That's your problem. You
          have no balls.

<b>          TAO
</b>          Look, I'm stuck here. Why don't
          you give me something useful to
          do.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Because unlike you I'm not
          useless. I maintain my property,
          whereas you swamp rats let your
          houses go to hell.
          Walt looks across the street at one very dilapidated
          house.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Wait a minute... How long do I
          have you for?
          Tao pauses... he doesn't want to answer.

<b>          WALT
</b>          How long, Toad?

          Walt laughs out loud. It makes Tao cringe.

</b>          Go get my ladder out of the
          garage.

</b>          Tao is at the top of the LADDER. Walt and the Hmong
          neighbor grin at him from the bottom.

<b>          WALT
</b>          When you're done caulking the
          siding, nail that gutter back up,
          I can see it right out my kitchen
          window, it's been bugging me for
          three years.
          The neighbor says something in Hmong to Walt.

<b>          WALT
</b>          You said it, brother.

<b>          56
</b>          Tao digs up a big TREE STUMP out in the rain. It's hard,
          draining labor and Tao is covered with mud.
          Tao's shovel hits rocks and roots and clay. Misery.

</b>
<b>          57
</b>          We see Tao do various chores; scrape paint, hang screen
          doors, reattach house numbers, trim bushes, etc.
          Walt scrutinizes his every move. Tao is a virtual slave.

</b>
<b>          58
</b>          Walt watches with great satisfaction as Tao paints one of
          the neighboring houses. The neighborhood is really
          shaping up.
          Walt sips his coffee with a slight grin. He is really,
          really, really enjoying this.

</b>          A very old Hmong man and his very young GRANDSON walk up
          Walt's driveway. The Grandson translates for grandpa.

<b>          GRANDSON
</b>          Grandpa says he want to know if
          you can have Tao clear out the big
          wasp nest under our porch?
          Walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I don't see why not.

</b>          Tao walks up the sidewalk. Before ringing the doorbell,
          Tao looks down at his hands which have several CALLOUSES
          on them.
          Tao rubs his hands with a smile. This has been the first
          time Tao has really risen to a task presented to him.
          Tao reaches for the doorbell...

          doorbell rings.
          Walt coughs up a big spot of blood, it's thick with
          fibers. The doorbell rings again.
          Walt wipes his mouth and runs the water in the sink.

          third time. Walt looks angry.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Jesus Lord almighty, knock it off.

<b>          TAO

</b>          Toad.
          Tao turns around. Walt wants to say something, but
          stops.

</b>          Nothing, never mind.
          Walt shuts the door.

          He's the only WHITE PERSON in the room. Even most of the
          STAFF is African or from India.
          As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez,
          Ngaima, Yang and Abdalla.
          Finally when the name “Kowalski” is called, the Muslim
          woman can't pronounce it correctly. Walt winces.

          A short Asian man in a doctor's smock comes in with a
          chart.

<b>          ASIAN DOCTOR
</b>          Mr. Kowalski?

<b>          WALT
</b>          That's right.

<b>          ASIAN DOCTOR
</b>          Good afternoon. I looked over
          your paperwork and I think we
          should immediately start on a full
          battery of tests. I feel that
          this...

</b>          It's Grandpa Walt.

<b>          KAREN
</b>          Well, pick it up.

          Ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the TALK button.

          The CAMERA INTERCUTS BETWEEN Mitch in his huge kitchen
          and Walt sitting on the edge of his bed.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Um... not much, how about you?

<b>          WALT
</b>          Good.
          There is a long, uncomfortable pause. Walt looks at some
          Xeroxed medical pamphlets scattered on his bed.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Good.

          my plate right now, unless there's
          something pressing.

          housekeeping bill.

<b>          WALT
</b>          No. Nope.
          Another pause.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Okay then.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Okay. Yeah, so it's not a good
          time right now. Why don't you
          call me over the weekend.

<b>          65
</b>          While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door.
          Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder,
          trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
          Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Hey, moron.
          Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What?

<b>          WALT
</b>          I appreciate you're doing
          something on your own, but you're
          the only person I know dumb enough
          to get himself killed trimming
          tree branches.

<b>          TAO
</b>          What now?

<b>          WALT
</b>          You don't stand on the top step of
          a ladder and if you cut through
          that branch you're hacking away
          at, you'll end up kaput.
          Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is
          five feet below the branch he's almost severed.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Go grab the extension ladder from
          my garage and I'll show you how to
          do it right, zipper head.

          cigarette, looks up in the tree and nods.

          Tao nods.

          leaves.

<b>          TAO
</b>          I know. I will.
          Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the
          cooler and watches Tao rake.
          A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past
          Tao.
          Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.

<b>          WALT
</b>          This kid doesn't have a chance.
          The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just
          stands there, sipping his beer.
          The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at
          Walt.
          The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens.
          Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one
          eye to better “aim” his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
          several times as if firing. Bang -- bang -- bang.
          The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and
          lights another cigarette.
          Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole
          interaction from his yard.

</b>          It must be a hundred degrees in

          Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles
          and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off.

          Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick
          succession, questioning Walt with his expression.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail
          punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife.
          Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile
          spacers.
          Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but
          he's too uncomfortable to speak up --

<b>          WALT
</b>          What?

<b>          TAO
</b>          I can't afford to buy all this
          stuff.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I didn't buy all this stuff at
          once, blockhead. I've lived here
          for fifty years. A man stays in
          one place long enough he tends to
          attract a decent set of tools.

<b>          TAO

<b>          WALT
</b>          Look, kid, I think I know where

          house. I'm going to let you in on
          a little secret.
          Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE
          items in quick succession.

<b>          WALT
</b>          This is for you. Roll of duct
          tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of
          vise-grips. Any man who's worth a
          shit can do half his household
          jobs with these three things. In
          the odd chance that doesn't work
          out, you can borrow something.

</b>          Okay. Cool.
          Walt coughs and covers his mouth. Both Tao and Walt see
          the spot of BLOOD in his hand.

<b>          TAO

          That's not good, you should see a
          doctor.
          Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the
          screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.

<b>          WALT
</b>          So... what exactly was the deal
          with those guys out on my lawn
          that night? Who are they?

<b>          TAO
</b>          A gang. Hmong gangbangers.

<b>          WALT
</b>          I gathered that. What did they
          want with you?

<b>          TAO
</b>          They wanted to take me away
          because I blew my first
          initiation.

<b>          WALT
</b>          You joined up with those pukes?
          Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the
          hell did you do that?

<b>          TAO
</b>          I don't know. They were
          persuasive. My cousin's in the
          gang. They just talked me into it
          I guess.

<b>          WALT
</b>          Well, at least you're honest about
          it.
          A LONG SILENCE. Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan.

          wheeled DOLLY. Walt attempts to pull the freezer
          upstairs.
          Walt strains with the heavy appliance. It's too much
          weight for Walt, but this doesn't stop him from heaving
          and pulling.
          Walt could have done this by himself when he was younger.

          the weight is up top, so you stay

          looks pretty heavy.

</b>          Afraid not.
          The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao kicks and struggles as
          they yank away his tool belt.

<b>          TAO
</b>          Keep your hands off my stuff.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          Your stuff? You and everything
          you have is mine. I own you.
          Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it
          against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can't
          destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          You can't just walk away from us,
          Tao. It looks bad. It makes me
          look bad.
          Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales...

<b>          SMOKIE
</b>          What's the phrase I'm looking for?
          Oh yeah, I need to ‘save face.'
          Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit
          CIGARETTE into Tao's cheek.
          Tao screams as his flesh burns.

          Walt watches as Spider and another Hmong gangbanger step
          out of the rundown duplex, get in their Honda and drive
          off.

          tosses him off the front porch onto the front sidewalk.
          Smokie is stunned. Walt kicks him hard in the ribs.

          Walt swings the barrel of the big Colt .45 at the
          movement.
          It's a cat. Walt puts his pistol away. Smokie exhales.

<b>          WALT
</b>          It's just you and me. Nobody

          And it comes like a cold wind -- SUE WALKS IN LIKE A
          ZOMBIE. She has been brutally beaten. Her clothes are

          BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt.
          Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand.
          Sue staggers into Vu's arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her
          mother and sobs.
          Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at

          guns.
