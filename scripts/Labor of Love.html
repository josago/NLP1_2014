<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT.  ROUTE 476 - OUTSKIRTS OF PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT
</b>
A three lane highway relegated to one lane.  The serpentine
line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by.  An arch of
ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass
and twisted metal.

We are at the site of a gruesome car accident.  An ambulance
and four police cars are on the scene.  Two cars are involved
in the crash.  The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front
caved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the
car.

The second car is a different story entirely.  A DARK GREEN
HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that
separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes.
All the windows have imploded.  The original seventeen foot
length of the car, compressed to ten.  The hood has folded
back into the front seat.  This car is not empty!  Through
the sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand,
purple, swollen and bloody.

Some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have
walked over to the flares.  A set of cops wave them back.

<b>                    POLICE OFFICER
</b>          Get back in your cars and continue
          with the traffic.  There is nothing
          you can do.
              (beat)
          Get back in your cars...

OFFICER PIERCE speaks to a female OFFICER DANA.

<b>                    OFFICER PIERCE
</b>          What's the story?

<b>                    OFFICER DANA
</b>          She's been dead about ten minutes.
          The jaws are on the way... Ran a
          license check.  Her name is Ellen
          Parker.  Forty-two years old.

<b>                    OFFICER PIERCE
</b>          What about him?

Pierce gestures to a HISPANIC TEENAGER who is cuffed behind
his back and being led to a police car.

<b>                    OFFICER DANA
</b><b>          D.U.I.
</b>
<b>                    OFFICER PIERCE
</b>          Shit... How old is he?

<b>                    OFFICER DANA
</b>          Seventeen.  It's his grandfather's
          car.  On his way back from drinking
          with the 'boys'.

Pierce lets it sink in.

<b>                    OFFICER PIERCE
</b>          Who do we contact for her?

Dana checks the papers in her hand.

<b>                    OFFICER DANA
</b>          Her husband.  Maurice Parker.  They
          live in Wynnewood.  Married
          seventeen years.

Pierce looks back at what remains of the HONDA PRELUDE.
Beat.

<b>                    OFFICER PIERCE
</b>          There isn't any good left in the
          world, Dana.  Not one damn thing.

CLOSE UP of the hypnotic RED AND BLUE LIGHTS that consume the
highway.

Just AFTER DAWN.  A gentle mist hangs in the air.  The calm
suburban streets wait to be flooded with a sea of middle
class homeowners on their way to work...

A woman's REEBOK CROSS-TRAINERS move along the sidewalk...
long, brisk steps, steps people have when walking with a
purpose...

The Cross-Trainers enter the doors of a bakery store seconds
after a man turns a window-sign from "CLOSED" to "OPEN"...
This happens with precision timing, not losing a step... a
well practiced routine.

ANGELO, a large man, black slicked hair -- has laid out three
identical loaves of RAISIN BREAD on the counter.

<b>                    ANGELO
</b>          Very good batch today.

We finally see the person standing in the REEBOK CROSS
TRAINERS... MRS. ELLEN PARKER, a woman in her forties with a
heart-warming smile and wise glint in her eyes.  The kind of
woman that somehow becomes more beautiful with age.

She carefully squeezes each loaf.  Her hand hovers over the
middle loaf.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          That one.

Twenty minutes later.  The basket of the "chosen" raisin
bread is placed on the center of a table.  Ellen covers it
with a cloth napkin.

The eggs sizzle in a pan.  We find Ellen cooking breakfast.
A stunning African Grey Parrot sits proudly on Ellen's
shoulder.  CLAUDE is a breathtaking creature with grey
feathers and a cherry red tail.

The DOOR BELL RINGS.

<b>FRONT DOOR

where a delivery man hands over a bouquet of VIOLET ORCHIDS.
Claude, still perched on Ellen like a clothing accessory,
spreads his impressive wings defensively.  The delivery man
scans the far wall to find a collection of bird photographs.
A dazzling collection of all kinds of birds, elaborately
framed and hung.

Ellen signs the release and closes the door.  She takes a
deep smell of the violet orchids and looks down the hall to
the open bedroom door with a glowing smile.  We CATCH A
GLIMPSE of a man dressing.

<b>KITCHEN

Where Ellen and her husband are eating breakfast.  Claude is
now in a cage in the hallway.

MR. MAURICE PARKER eats a buttered piece of raisin bread.  He
is a man in his late forties, neatly combed hair, his New
York Times folded into a manageable rectangle.  This is a man
who has been seated a great deal of his life... the type of
man who breaks into a sweat when taking out the garbage.

He feels a stare and looks up to find his wife with that
glowing smile.  He smiles back.

Ellen gestures with her eyes to the violet orchids now
displayed proudly on the window ledge.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Yes?

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          The flowers... they're beautiful.

Maurice studies them.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          They are... who sent them?

Beat.  This takes Ellen by surprise.  Maurice catches the
expression.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          You thought I sent them?

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>              (disappointed)
          There was no card.

Maurice reaches over and searches the bouquet.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Have I forgotten something?  Is
          this a special day?

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>              (flat)
          It's just a regular day.

Maurice pulls out a small bent card from between the stems.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          It's from Dan and Kate Wilkins...
          for dinner last week...

Maurice hands Ellen the card, she looks at it uninterested.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          It's a special day isn't it?

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas,
          because you'd be worried about how
          much money we don't have to spend
          on each other... I know it's not
          New Years, because you'd be going
          on and on about wearing a tuxedo
          and how much you don't like to
          dance... and I'm sure it's not our
          anniversary, because I didn't find
          an envelope with a hundred dollars
          cash on my bureau with a note that
          says, 'Pick out something
          pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm
          virtually certain it's not a
          special day today.

Ellen begins to eat.  Maurice stares at her...

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          You're mad at me... You were
          beaming a minute ago, but since I
          didn't send the flowers... now
          you're mad at me.

Beat.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Why would I send flowers?  What's
          the occasion.

Ellen instantly becomes emotional.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          Occasion?  Because you love me...
          That's the occasion.

Ellen returns to eating.  Maurice stares at her quietly.

<b>INT.  BOOKSTORE - MORNING
</b>
A SHAFT OF LIGHT penetrates the darkness of a room... growing
LARGER as the door swings open.

Ellen steps in first followed by Maurice.  Ellen goes
straight for the blinds.  BURST OF LIGHT stab the room.

The spines of the BOOKS catch the light... rows and rows of
books cradled by a maze of mahogany book shelves.  This is an
old-fashioned store with antique chairs at select places.  A
coffee table sits near the window with a set of deep
cushioned sofa-chairs.  This store is a home...

Maurice moves behind the counter and TURNS ON THE RADIO.
CHOPIN FLOWS from the old speakers atop the corner shelves --
delicately.

Ellen opens the door to the store and locks it in that
position with a slanted piece of wood... The store is now
open.

<b>INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY
</b>
Half a dozen people wander the isles.  Maurice's eyes drift
to a pair of eleven year olds who have sauntered into the
store.  One boy disappears behind "Philosophy" and reappears
momentarily with his sweat-shirt zipped up to his neck -- a
rectangle is outlined under his shirt.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I see that!

Maurice comes around the corner -- the boys HAUL ASS out of
the store.  They're long gone before Maurice reaches the
door.  He yells after them.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I'm getting a Doberman!  Two!

Ellen who is sitting in the back room doing the accounts,
comes out when she hears the commotion.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          You've been saying that for two
          years; I think they know you're
          bluffing.

Maurice inspects the "Philosophy" section.

Maurice looks up as a young man, early twenties, hurries in.
KRIS REDDY walks past Maurice, his black locks of hair
peeking out from under his Philadelphia Eagles cap.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>              (to Maurice)
          Lizy Bennett?

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          Hi Kris.

Kris waves as he removes his jacket.  He is wearing a PARKER
BOOKS T-shirt underneath.  He pins an "Assistant Manager" tag
on.

Maurice thinks to himself.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...
              (the answer comes to him)
          Pride and Prejudice.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          You're amazing.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          It has to be a full character's
          name.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          They called her 'Lizy' in the
          book...
              (beat)
          Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on
          the way over from the paper.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          They printed your article on, 'Dry
          Verses Can Dog Food'... Very
          enlightening.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          Pulitzer, here I come.

Kris notices as Maurice goes back to searching the isles.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          What happened?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Never have children.  If they're
          not a burden to you, they're a
          burden to someone else.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>              (on the end of his words)
          Kris, go to the pharmacy.  Ask Mr.
          Donnavan to get you a large bottle
          of Geritol... Tell him, Maurice has
          officially become a grumpy old man.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          What'd they take this time?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Nietzsche!... As if they're going
          to read Nietzsche.

Maurice moves back behind the counter clearly irritated.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          They pick on you because they can
          get a rise out of you... children
          can sense those things.

Kris quickly opens his black shoulder bag and pulls out a
mini-tape recorder.  He talks into it -- dead serious.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          Monday -- August 24... Juvenile
          delinquency -- Are the victims to
          blame?

CLICK.  The tape recorder returns to the bag.  Ellen stares
at him curiously.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          Story ideas.  I'll forget them
          otherwise.

Ellen nods with realization.  Ellen and Kris turn their
attention to Maurice who is mumbling to himself angrily.  He
looks out the window to the street to see a familiar group of
school boys waving at him tauntingly.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Two thousand square feet... We can
          add a used book section.

Ellen is not listening.  She is staring at a young couple two
tables over, who can't take their eyes off each other.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Next door is a jewelry store with a
          full-time security guard... He
          stands outside all day.  Let's see
          them try and take Nietzsche then...

Maurice finally notices Ellen is not listening.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Ellen?

<b>                    ELLEN

          happy, we should just do it.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          It's a tremendous amount of work --
          moving.

<b>                    ELLEN

<b>                    ELLEN

          not just words.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          What's that?  That's not a
          fortune... You will be rich...
          That's a fortune.  What you have is
          a statement.

<b>                    ELLEN

          What would you do for our love?
          I'm not talking about saying, I'm

Maurice notices the STRAIN IN HER VOICE.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Is this going to be similar to the
          flower incident?

<b>                    ELLEN

          No I don't.  I don't even know if
          you'd walk across the street for
          me.

Maurice is getting redder by the second.  The entire
restaurant hangs on his response...

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          So what have you done for me that's
          so earth-shattering?

The waiter closest to the table cringes with Maurice's words.
Ellen drains of color.  She stares at him in complete and
utter disbelief.  She drills him with this iron glare for an
eternity then grabs her purse and heads to the exit.  Maurice
stares at the table for a moment to gather what's left of his
dignity and follows her out.

The waiter moves to the table and clears the aftermath.  He
sees Ellen's fortune crumpled next to her tea cup.  He
unravels it.  The fortune reads...

<b>INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

The room is LIT BY ONE BEDSIDE LAMP.  Maurice is sitting in
bed wearing a robe.  Reading glasses at the end of his nose
as he rubs a yellow cloth over a SILVER MEDALLION.  The
medallion has a raised picture of a lamp, the kind Aladdin
uses, seated on an open book and the words BOOK SOCIETY -
1992.  Maurice meticulously rubs away the smudge marks.

Ellen is at the edge of the bed -- as far from Maurice as
possible.  Her back is to him as she sleeps under the covers.
She speaks without turning around.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          Why do you polish that thing all
          the time?

Maurice studies the impressive silver medallion.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          A Book Society Award is a very
          prestigious thing.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          Why are you polishing it -- in bed
          -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at
          night?  Are you going to show it to
          someone?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          There's no reason.

<b>                    ELLEN

          It just makes you feel good to do
          something for it, to express your
          pride and affection for it some
          how...
              (beat)
          How come you'd do that for a piece
          of metal and not for me?

Maurice has no answer.  He just stares at his hands.

ELLEN'S face can be seen under the covers facing away from
Maurice.  Her eyes are red.  The tears roll off her nose and
land on the pillow unseen and unheard.

The kitchen table is mockingly empty.  No bread.  Not even a
crumb.  Maurice, dressed for work, eyes the table with great
resolve.  He rubs his hands together ceremoniously.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I can do this.

Maurice moves to the fridge and gets out two eggs, onions,
green peppers and mushrooms.

CLAUDE is chirping INCESSANTLY FROM THE HALL.

The pile teeters precariously in Maurice's arms as he moves
to the counter.  Next the pans come out -- He tries to pull
the bottom pan from the cabinet --

Ellen gently takes Claude out of his cage.  She kisses him.
The bird, once frantic, instantly at peace.

          You missed mommie... worried when I
          didn't come down... my baby... so
          sweet.

Ellen feeds the bird as she peeks around the corner, careful
not to be seen.  Maurice is desperately trying to cook an out
of control omelette.  It spills over the sides and SIZZLES on
the range top.  He tries to scoop it up with the pan, tilting
it further -- further -- the entire omelette slides onto the
range.  Maurice frantically tries to wrangle it back in.  Man
vs. Egg.  Man losing.

Ellen has to keep herself from laughing.  Her expression
changes to pity as she watches the chaos unfold.

A defeated Maurice is eating an apple.  He looks up with
surprise as Ellen walks into the kitchen from the back door,
a bag under her arm.  She glances at him and then moves to
the counter where she prepares the bread for serving.  Ellen
looks down into the trash to find the rebellious omelette
sitting uneaten.

The bread gets laid out in its usual basket, in its usual
manner.  Maurice says nothing as Ellen pulls two eggs from
the fridge and cracks them on a sizzling pan with expert
ease.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          Onions?

Maurice smiles warmly at his wife's back before moving to her
and hugging her from behind.  He whispers in her ear.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Why do you put up with me?

Beat.

<b>                    ELLEN
</b>          Love... has something to do with
          it.

Maurice reaches over and turns off the stove.  He then turn
Ellen around and kisses her long and hard.  Ellen pulls away
gently and stares into his eyes.  Maurice looks very
emotional.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I do love you... very, very much.

Ellen kisses Maurice and returns to the eggs.  Maurice
continues to hug her from behind.  The MORNING SUN pours into
the kitchen covering Ellen and Maurice in a golden bath.

presently a cob-web infested, barren space with a few
discarded packing boxes left in the corners.

Maurice runs his fingertips against the wall.

says the next two words with great awe as if he was saying
something holy.

Carl watches curiously as Maurice walks around in a trance.
He moves to the bay window that over looks the street.

Maurice's already bright eyes, brighten even more as he spots
the security guard strolling up and down the front of the
jewelry store.  The guard catches his stare and waves.
Maurice is aglow... He turns to Carl.

<b>                    MAURICE

Carl smiles patiently, he's seen this before.

Maurice gathers his strength as he puts pen to paper... He
scribbles his signature quickly and let's the pen drop to the
table top as if all the energy drained from his body.  He
looks up to Carl with powerful eyes.

A wine chiller sits proudly on the coffee table.  The SOUNDS
OF LIGHT CONVERSATION float through the room.  About ten
friends and family have gathered.

Maurice sits on the sofa nearest the window.  He's listening
to the drone of TED PRICE.

Ellen is not present.

<b>                    TED

          Love that can conquer all?'  I say,
          'Whoa, hold on.  Just so we're

          she says, 'Fine, but how do you
          feel about kids?'

Everyone near the SOFA LAUGHS.  A CAR LIGHT DANCES ON THE
CURTAINS... Maurice quickly pulls the curtain aside and
watches as the car pulls past the house and around the
corner.  Maurice turns back from the window hiding his
concern and without missing a beat...

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          It's nice to see you don't have any
          scars from your divorce.

This brings on another ROUND OF LAUGHTER.

<b>THE TELEPHONE RINGS.
</b>
Maurice rises from his seat -- but is waved off by ADELLE
MATLIN who picks up the phone right away.  Adelle is
Maurice's niece, early thirties, very attractive and always
smiling -- except at this moment.

Ted begins another one of his stories -- the words are
incoherent as Maurice watches Adelle carefully... Adelle
turns her back to the room as she talks and then DISAPPEARS
into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the
doorway... Something is definitely wrong.

Maurice steadies his gaze at the door of the kitchen...
eternal seconds pass before Adelle appears again.  She looks
different -- ghostly.  She glances up for a fraction of a
second locking eyes with her uncle -- she immediately looks
away.

Maurice watches Adelle move to her husband GERALD and
whispers in his ear.  Gerald changes instantly -- taking on
the same ghostly transformation -- his eyes dart to Maurice.

Ted's story is cut off as Maurice speaks LOUDLY...

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          What's wrong?

The room goes SILENT as all eyes fall on Adelle and Gerald.

          Maurice, can we go into the dining
          room?

Beat.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          What's happened to my wife?

This hits everyone in the room like a bomb.  A dread hangs
over every passing second... Gerald crumbles under the
moment... Adelle begins to cry.

<b>                    GERALD
</b>          There was a car accident... Drunk
          driver.

Some of the crowd reacts.  A women covers her mouth.  The
moment is unbearable.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (to himself)
          Please God -- don't do this.

Gerald cracks -- the tears start to flow from his eyes.

<b>                    GERALD
</b>          Maurice, it was serious... I don't
          know how to --

Gerald buries his face into the heels of his palms as if
trying to contain an explosion in his head.

<b>                    GERALD
</b>          Oh Jesus, please help me... She
          didn't... Ellen didn't make it...
          Ellen's dead Maurice.

Maurice closes his eyes shut tightly... like a child scared
of the dark.

Adelle blacks out, knocking over the wine chiller on the way
to the ground.  In less than a minute the room has
transformed from a celebration to a mourning.  Everyone is
frozen staring at Maurice for their cue... A child in her
mother's arms begins to cry as if aware of the circumstances.

EXTREME CLOSE UP.  Maurice opens his eyes slowly.  The room
stays still as Maurice stares at Ellen's HAT sitting on the

he tries desperately, can't fight it -- Maurice Parker begins

His hands grab frantically at the rest of the dresses --
pressing them to his face and chest.

spilling out in this one moment.

He falls to the ground yanking all the dresses down with him

ELDERLY COUPLE -- in their seventies.  The OLD WOMAN is frail
with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles.  The husband
is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like
a little boy.

Maurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands...
Their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him.
He watches as the old man gets up.  The old woman tries to
make him stay, but he playfully pulls away.  She shakes her
head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down
the path by himself.

The old woman glances Maurice's way.

next to the bench.

blanket in the grass.

<b>                    MAURICE

</b>          I mean besides... time -- how did
          you know ten years ago -- twenty

She thinks hard... tough question.  No answer for a moment

her husband is walking up the path with her white lace
sweater over his arm...

She smiles as the answer comes to her.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          No.  How far in one attempt --
          what's the farthest someone like
          myself could walk?

The doctor is confused again.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Just for curiosity sake that's all?

<b>                    DR. ROYCE

              (taking on a rehearsed
               tone)
          From Philadelphia following the
          route highlighted to Pacifica
          California -- you're traveling an
          estimated three thousand two
          hundred miles...

Maurice is a bit pale.  He follows the yellow highlighted
highways winding it's way across the U.S.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Three thousand miles?... How many
          times does twenty go into three
          thousand?

<b>                    JOSELLE

</b>          This is the route approved by

          back roads the entire way, you'd
          still be looking at roughly the
          same distance...

Joselle studies his concerned expression.

<b>                    JOSELLE
</b>          Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take

Joselle scrunches her face in exaggerated shock and takes a
step back to look Maurice up and down.

<b>                    JOSELLE
</b>          How else you gonna get there on the

Maurice gives her a sad expression.  If she only knew.

Maurice sits on the floor against the far wall.  He stares at
his new store.  His gaze turns to the window where the guard
strolls by.  The guard doesn't notice him.

Maurice looks terrible, his eyes red and framed by bags...
his skin a yellowish white.

He moves to his feet and TURNS OFF THE LIGHTS.

Kris unloads the last of a shipment of books.  He moves to
Maurice who sits by the window to the street.  Maurice points
to a chair across from him and Kris takes a seat.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Why do you want to be a journalist
          Kris?  What sparked your interest?

Beat.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          I want to reach people.  Nobody
          listens to me.  This is my way to
          reach them.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          To reach people, you have to feel
          something first... You write about
          the wrong things.  How can you feel
          for dog food?  The people at the
          Gazette don't respect it, and
          neither do you.

Maurice looks out the window and picks up an envelope from
the coffee table between them.  He hands it to Kris.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Your bus is arriving.

Kris opens the envelope and finds money.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          It's one month's pay.

Kris gets up.  A shock of adrenaline hits him.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          Are you firing me?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          No.  No... I won't be here for a
          while.  The store will be closed in

Kris grabs his coat, shifting his attention between the
window and Maurice?

Kris stops cold.  The door to the street half-open.

</b>          When are you leaving?

<b>                    MAURICE

Kris is seriously confused now.  Maurice decides to end the
confusion.

</b>          I'm walking there Kris.

</b>          Walking where?

Kris' jaw hits the floor as the bus pulls to a stop across
the street.  Kris pulls up his sleeve and glances at his
forearm.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          The hairs on my arm are standing

Kris hesitates before darting out of the store, across the

digs into his bag and pulls out the tape recorder.  CLICK.

Three things lay on the dining table.  A shoulder bag filled

Maurice checks the locks on all windows... He places all the
food in the refrigerator into a trash bag... He pulls out a
drawer and loosens a side panel, a wad of money flops out.
Maurice pockets the bills...

Maurice walks through the hall with a portable cage.  He
stops before Claude's hanging cage... no movement, no
chirping.  Maurice stares emotionally for a moment before
reaching in and carefully removing CLAUDE'S LIFELESS BODY

Ellen places the soda she had at her side on the table.
Maurice is completely flustered.

Ellen places her hand out.  Maurice grabs it instinctively
and shakes.

Ellen looks at the full table of books.

Maurice peels off his shoes with great pain.  They slide

Maurice rubs his barefeet with both hands -- grimacing from

The steam from the water fills the room.

Maurice raises his legs with great effort and submerges each

Maurice as he walks down a winding highway.  His new sneakers
shuffling slowly.

A SHARP PAIN SHOOTS UP MAURICE'S LEG.  His knees buckle.  The
shoulder bags tumble to the ground followed by Maurice
himself.  From a distance it looks like he's been shot.

Maurice grabs the back of his thigh and tries to straighten
his leg out... His face frozen in a painful expression.
Maurice rubs his legs slowly -- working the cramp out.  He
relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg.  Maurice
sits there motionless -- eyes glazed... defeated.

The SOUNDS OF A BIRD snap him out of his trance.  He looks up
to see a PAINTED BUNTING, a bird about six inches in height
FLY DOWN from a tree and land on a rock next to him.  Maurice
stares at the beautiful bird curiously.  Its body splashed
with brilliant blues, reds and greens.  It looks out of place
in these mundane surroundings.  Maurice looks around the
skies to see no other birds.  The Painted Bunting chirps a
few times before taking flight into the air.  It circles over
Maurice before disappearing behind the trees.

Maurice smiles.  He pulls himself to his feet with great
effort.

Maurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the
essentials -- the maps, food, a canister of water.

Maurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder with
great effort.  At his feet, are the rest of his belonging --
piled on the side of the road.

Maurice painfully begins walking again.

WE PULL BACK on Maurice's figure walking on the highway...
the pile of disregarded things laying by the side... The
highway is endless... winding it's way for miles and miles
into a fixed dot in the distance.

          do me that favor?

Silence.  Then everyone in the group BURSTS OUT IN DRUNKEN
<b>LAUGHTER.

<b>                    DENNY

<b>                    MAURICE

          No, I just don't want anybody dying
          because I didn't say something when
          I had the chance.

Denny's face goes blank.  No emotion.  His steady gaze almost
terrifying.

<b>                    DENNY
</b>          I'll drive my truck shit-faced if I
          want to.  You better turn around
          and walk away preacher.  You don't
          know who you're talking to.

Maurice looks around at the hostile faces and decides on a
retreat.  Denny watches Maurice with predatory eyes.

Maurice practically hobbles his way down a road lined by
towering pines.  He stops to take a drink from his canister
and keeps walking.  The SOUNDS OF A CAR GROW IN THE DISTANCE.
Maurice doesn't turn his back.

The CANARY YELLOW TRUCK pulls over the ridge with a load full
of passengers.  It gains distance on Maurice.

Maurice hears the ENGINE and waves HIS ARM IN THE AIR --
signaling for it to pass him.  Maurice walks ten more feet
before turning around.

Maurice's face instantly changes when he sees the demented
grins through the windshield of the truck.  Maurice turns and
quickens his pace... The truck picks up pace... Maurice
breaks into a run... The truck speeds up, passes Maurice and
stops in front of him.

Panic fills Maurice as he watches the truck unload it's
drunken passengers.  Eyes scan the forest on either side for
a way out.  Maurice decides to stand his ground.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (to himself)
          This is Indiana -- nothing's going
          to happen to you.

<b>                    DENNY
</b>          You need a ride, Preacher?

The men walk up to Maurice.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          No thank you I'll walk.

A tall lanky gentleman gestures to Maurice's shoulder bag
with his beer can.  Some beer sprays Maurice's feet with the
gesture.

<b>                    WIL
</b>          Where you coming from?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Look gentlemen, I'm late, I need
          to --

<b>                    DENNY
</b>          I've been thinking -- who the hell
          is this preacher guy?  Coming up to
          me and my friends?  Looking like he
          wanted to kick my ass for drinking?

Denny gives Maurice that inhuman stare.  Maurice is clearly
frightened.

<b>                    DENNY
</b>          Then I figured it.  You're angry.
          You lost somebody, because some
          asshole was drinking.

Maurice is frozen.

<b>                    DENNY
</b>          Maybe you lost a son?  A sister?  A
          wife?

Maurice looks up for a millisecond.  Denny doesn't miss it.

<b>                    DENNY
</b>              (stepping closer)
          A wife?... Did someone piss drunk
          run into your wife?  Crushed her
          like a bug.  Snapped her bones?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          That's enough.

Maurice is red with anger.  Denny loves it.

<b>                    DENNY
</b>          Oh the preacher's getting angry
          again...
              (Denny goes ice cold)
          Tell me something.  Did she die
          instantly or did she feel every
          torn muscle and shattered bone?
          Were you there to help her?  Or
          were you safe at home when the
          windshield sliced into her face --

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I'll kill you!

Maurice swings.  Denny easily avoids it.  Maurice doesn't see
the first BLOW COMING, IT HITS HIM IN THE CHEST -- Maurice
gasps for air as he buckles to the dirt.  Hands grab --
restrain.  A POWERFUL KICK IN THE RIBS -- ANOTHER...
LAUGHTER... ANOTHER SET OF VICIOUS KICKS... The road and
forest begin to spin... A PAINFUL SLASH ACROSS HIS FACE...

Maurice prepares for the next blow... it never comes.  RED
AND BLUE lights swirl... Maurice looks up, barely focusing --
a man leans over a car door... The image becomes clearer -- a
POLICEMAN stands poised -- gun aimed directly at the men
hovering over him.

He jots down the words as fast as they're said:

The transmission gets cut as the phone conversation ends.
Kris quickly rolls the chair across the room and grabs a map

The map gets pinned under two coffee cups and a ceramic frog

Maurice and Officer Grey are seated on the front stairs of
the precinct drinking coffee when ADELLE MATLIN DRIVES UP.

Adelle steps out of a RENTED TOYOTA CELICA.  Her tense --
frightened eyes betray her mental state for the past ten
hours.  She walks to the stairs.

<b>                    GREY
</b>          Mrs. Matlin... good morning.

Maurice slowly gets up.  Adelle is in shock as she looks at
the stranger before her.

Maurice stands in a 'COLTS' football T-shirt, faded jeans and
sneakers.  His left cheek is black and blue, and his arm and
side are bandaged.

<b>                    ADELLE

</b>          High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with
          heel support and air-cushioned
          soles.  They're nasty.

Adelle wasn't sure what that meant.  She shakes it off and
hugs Maurice.  She is visibly relieved to have him in her
arms.

<b>                    GREY
</b>          My shift ended an hour ago.

Adelle notices the ROSE in Grey's hand.  Grey catches her
glance.

</b>          It's for my wife.

<b>                    ADELLE

Grey looks to Maurice -- they exchange a knowing smile.

<b>                    GREY
</b>          No occasion.

Adelle notices the WINK exchanged between Grey and Maurice.

<b>                    GREY

Adelle changes gears.  She takes a seat next to Maurice and
studies his legs and tired face carefully before uttering the
words.

          plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for

          money?  Time?  Really do it
          properly.  This is all so -- by the
          seat of your pants.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          Why did you take the back roads
          here?  They're not safe.  You'd
          know that if you'd planned.

          how are you possible going to walk
          another two thousand-five hundred
          miles in your present condition?

Maurice is stumped.  He looks unsure.  He instantly looks on
the verge of tears.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Nothing's going to happen.

YELLOW WARBLER, a striking bird about eight inches long with
vivid yellow feathers.  It sits elegantly on a nearby branch.
He walks towards it -- it stays in position.  Closer.  The
bird chirps back at him.  Maurice is within arms reach of the
bird.

Evening, just before bed.  Maurice is reading.  Ellen is
monitoring the bird closely.  It lays on the bedside table --
wrapped gently with a hand towel.  A morsel of food is
lowered into its mouth with a pair of tweezers.  The bird
stares blankly at the ceiling.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          It isn't going to make it Ellen.
          Let the poor thing go quietly.

Her delicate hand rubs the bird's stomach.

two plates at the table.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          Yes I understand, it does sound
          humorous, but this is a very
          serious situation.

Gerald is cooking.  He gently flips the chicken breast in a
butter and garlic sauce.

<b>                    GERALD
</b>          This smells good.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          Why am I such an authority?

<b>                    GERALD
</b>              (under his breath)
          Here comes the resume.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          I received my B.S. from the
          University of Pennsylvania, my
          P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I
          worked three years at the Boston
          University School of Medicine,
          during which time I had articles
          printed in the "Journal of
          Educational Psychology", "American
          Journal of Psychology", "Psychology
          Review" and "Science"... So I think
          it's safe to say my opinion is
          valid.

Gerald brings the sizzling pan over and divides the steaming
dish into both plates.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          Look, please find him for me...
          Officer, I tried... but I brought
          back the wrong person.

Gerald quickly scoops some rice onto both plates.  His mouth
is watering as he goes for the utensils.

Adelle abruptly stands at her place.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          Stop laughing!

Gerald gets into his seat at the table just in time to see
Adelle angrily hang up the phone.  She stares off into space
before unconsciously cleaning the table.  Adelle picks up
both plates of food...

<b>                    GERALD
</b>          Adelle --

Gerald's heart sinks as Adelle pops open the trash can with a
tap of her foot and dumps the picture perfect meal into the
garbage.  She goes to the sink and rinses the plates
completely preoccupied with her thoughts.  She mumbles to
herself as she shuts off the water.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          He says he admires him.

Adelle storms out of the kitchen.  Gerald sits at the empty
table with a fork in his hands.  He shakes his head in
disbelief.

The land is flat.  From the roads one can see endless fields
in all directions.  When the wind blows, the crops bend in
unison, changing the shape and texture of the land for a
moment and instantly changing back with a snap of the wind.

Maurice takes in the beauty of the land through a painful
grimace.  Occasionally clutching his right leg in moments of
extreme pain.

Maurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road
and watches the wind change the fields.  He closes his jacket
as the gusts become stronger.

Maurice looks worse than ever.  His hair and shirt are soaked

His feet are visible -- sticking out from beneath the sheets.
They look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen
and bruised.  They disappear under the sheets.

<b>EXT.  STREET - DAY
</b>
Early morning.  The branches of the trees are encapsulated in
ice.  The snow piled ten inches on every surface.  Maurice,
buried deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around.
His breath materializes with every step.  He forces a weak
smile at the magical landscape before him.  White.  Pure.
Peaceful.

The SOUNDS OF A VOLVO STATION WAGON urges Maurice to the side
of the road.  As it passes a little girl waves from the
passenger window.  Maurice puts on a brave face and waves
back.

Another CAR ENTERS the picture -- A DARK BLUE FIREBIRD rises
over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast.

SLOW-MOTION as the Firebird skids over the ice and the snow
-- the driver desperately trying to gain control... The
mother in the Volvo hits the BRAKES as the Firebird spins
into her lane... Maurice yells out.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          No!

The cars IMPACT with a sickening CRUNCH -- BACK TO REAL TIME:

The Firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and
coming to a stop in a bank of snow.

The Volvo isn't so lucky.  It flips from the impact...
sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the
road... It comes to a rest a hundred feet away.

SILENCE.  STILLNESS.  The entire event took only seconds.

Maurice runs frantically after the Volvo.  The windows are
SHATTERED.  Snow has packed into the over-turned car.  No one
can be seen inside the vehicle.

Maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his
hand.  His arm disappears up to the shoulder.  His face
grimacing with the strain.  His arm comes out slowly...

A few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks
through the wall of snow and slides out of the window.  She
lets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by
the wrist.

Maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (panting)
          It's okay.  It's all over.

Maurice lays her gently against a snow bank, before moving to
the other side of the car.

<b>                    DRIVER (O.S.)
</b>          Is she okay?

Maurice looks up to see the driver of the Firebird walking
towards him.  He looks dazed.

Maurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in
the snow... deeper than before.  His cheek pressed against
the snow, almost laying flat on the ground.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (frantic)
          Oh no... she's wearing a seat-belt.

Maurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... He lets out a
POWERFUL GRUNT as he pulls back with all his strength -- a
woman's WRIST appears first, then the tangled hair and then
the body spills out onto the road next to Maurice.

The driver appears over the Woman and Maurice and loses it
when he sees them.

<b>                    DRIVER
</b>          It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my
          fault.

Maurice, out of breath, clears the woman's face and mouth --
no movement.  No sound.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Come on... please...

Maurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth...

</b>          Please...

She doesn't respond.

She takes a breath.  Life quickly returns to her body.
Maurice places her head in his lap and hugs her, lightly
rocking back and forth.  The tears streaming down his red
face.

Hansen scoffs down his third dessert.  Maurice stares at him
oddly.

The PAY PHONE RINGS.  Hansen jumps to his feet too quickly.
He tries to recover.

<b>                    HANSEN

          Hansen, apparently this guy Parker
          lost his wife and went a little
          fruity.  I spoke with his niece,
          Adelle Matlin and she says to
          restrain him.  That he's dangerous

The ride progresses in silence.  Hansen and Tandy in the

window.  His eyes begin to shut slightly as sleep overcomes
him.  The car goes over a BUMP.  Maurice jars awake.  He
glances out the window to see a highway sign swish by in the
<b>HEADLIGHTS.  'ROUTE 80 EAST'.
</b>
East?  Maurice looks around quickly at the passing scenery.

<b>                    MAURICE

Hansen and Tandy exchange looks.

<b>                    HANSEN
</b>          I'm going to drop off Tandy at the

Hansen looks back to the road.  The drive continues in
silence.  Tandy checks his watch just when a CLICK -- A HARD
WIND -- AND A METALLIC SLAM in quick succession shakes the
car.

Maurice staggers through the naked trees.  Thin trees every
few feet with no branches.  The snow ankle deep.

Maurice braces himself against a trunk, checking his hands.
His vision blurs as he stares down at his scraped bloody
palms.

The forest clears quickly into an open field.  Far in the
distance across the field of white is a small pointed
building standing alone.  The glow of a LIGHT can be seen
through the windows.

Maurice trudges through the deeper snow.  Stumbling many
times.  The frigid wind pushing him to his knees.  Maurice
keeps moving -- the field seems endless...

Maurice's feet hit the snow of the driveway, just as his legs
buckle -- his face HITS the snow hard.  He manages to roll
over on his back with great effort.  He stares up at the
pointed building -- the dull light becoming duller...
something blocks the light.  A man.  Maurice feels himself
rise into the air as two powerful arms scoop him off the ice.

A PRIEST carries him into the doors of a CHURCH.

A dimly lit cathedral.  Six foot six, FATHER BERCHMAN walks
down the center isle of the cathedral, through a cloth
curtain and into a

<b>BACK ROOM
</b>
where Maurice is sitting in a chair wrapped in a blanket.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          What did they ask?

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          If I had seen you.  By the way I'm
          sorry about your wife.  They told
          me.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Thank you... I'm sorry you had to
          lie.  It must have been difficult.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          I asked the officers if you had
          committed some crime... If they had
          said 'yes', you would be speaking
          with them right now.

This is the father's own room.  Very sparse as one would
expect.  He moves to his bureau and retrieves some pills.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          Take these, and if you're up to it,
          try to explain how it is you came
          to be sitting here.

Maurice follows the father's instructions and tightens the
blanket around his shoulders.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I'm walking for my wife.

Beat.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          To where?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Pacifica, California.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          From where?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          I see.

Beat.  The father nods as if this is not shocking news.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          Why?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Do you believe a person's soul
          lives on after their death?

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          Most certainly.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          And that that soul takes part of
          the person they were on this earth
          with them.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          That's a reasonable assumption.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I don't want my wife's soul having
          any doubts.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          Doubts?  About what?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          About my love for her.

The father nods with understanding as if everything became
very clear with that statement.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          You don't have to prove anything to
          her.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I'm not proving to her.  I'm
          showing her.  And I know I don't
          have to.  I want to.  I've
          realized, love is about giving.
          I'm alive, I can still give to her.
          I want to give her everything I
          can.

The father studies this stranger before him with great
admiration.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          There are some people, including
          those officers, that are trying to
          stop me.  They mean well.  But they
          don't understand.  I wouldn't
          either if I were them.

Maurice struggles with the last words.  He slumps back --
physically drained.

The father gets up and takes the empty glass of water from
Maurice's hands.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          I want you to stay here a few days
          until you're better.  You're no use
          to your wife in this condition.

The father moves for the curtain.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          You think I'm crazy too.

The father turns and smiles warmly.

<b>                    FATHER
</b>          I have spent my life dedicated to
          love.  Love of God.  Love of
          humanity.  And here you are living
          through love.  Bathing in it.
          Using its strength, its magic, its
          ability to overcome any barrier...
          If you are crazy, I hope my
          insanity is not far off.

Maurice's eyes well up instantly.

We are looking inside a fancy Center-City Philadelphia
restaurant.  Adelle and Gerald are seated by an enormous bay
window.  A waiter comes to their table with their main
course.  Gerald watches the food being served with great
anticipation.

Gerald's eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on
the sidewalk... He squints to see better.  Realization hits
hard... His eyes light up.  He looks to Adelle and back to
the magazine stand.

In a mad race for time, Gerald begins to devour the food on
his plate.  The waiter and Adelle watch him in shock.  Adelle
glances out the window.  Her eyes squint... then light up.
She jumps to her feet and grabs Gerald by the arm, a fork
full of food drops to his plate.  Gerald looks back at his
full plate longingly as Adelle pulls him out of the
restaurant.

The waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand.  He

Maurice spots a small town nestled in the arms of the
mountain range.  He begins the journey to rest.

old ISAAC CALDWELL.

Maurice looks up as MRS. CALDWELL comes to the door.

Mrs. Caldwell stops as she stares at Maurice.

<b>                    MAURICE

          I don't look like much, but if
          there are any things that need to
          get done around the house --

Mrs. Caldwell doesn't listen, but instead yells behind the
door.

<b>                    MRS. CALDWELL
</b>          Dave... you're not going to believe

his face lights up.

<b>                    MRS. CALDWELL
</b>          This is Maurice Parker -- the one

Mr. Caldwell is completely floored.  So, for that matter is
Maurice.  Mr. Caldwell puts out his hand with awe.

<b>                    MR. CALDWELL

He moves to the window and stares at the moon lit
landscape... enormous, endless, dwarfing.

The rocking chair CREAKS as Maurice melts into it.  He rubs
his calves slowly, the pain evident in his face.  His head
leans back after a moment... on the verge of sleep.

The SOUND OF TINY FOOTSTEPS stirs him.  He looks to the
doorway to find Isaac standing quietly at the door in his
baseball P.J.s.

</b>          Oh no... I'm not good at that.
          Very bad in fact...

Too late.  Isaac climbs up into Maurice's lap with great
effort.  Maurice looks down at Isaac who waits patiently for
him to begin.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I would be exceedingly boring.

Isaac waits.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I don't do these type of things.

Isaac -- still waiting.

              (beat)
          ... Just a short one okay?

Isaac gets in position, cradled in Maurice's arms.  Maurice
searches for something to say.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          There was a boy named Isaac who
          wanted to play baseball, but he was
          too small and no one would let him
          play... but he kept practicing by
          himself -- waiting... He went to

          with his glove.

Isaac points to Maurice.

<b>                    MAURICE

          kids baseball.  But right before
          the game, the second best player on

          played a prank on a nice man who
          owned a book store... When that boy
          grew up he was convicted on
          burglary charges and spent fifteen
          years in prison -- where he
          belongs.

Isaac didn't understand that last part.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Anyway, Big Billy needed another
          player so he yelled into the
          stands.  'Who can play baseball?'
          And there was a little voice that
          yelled out, 'Me, I can play.'
          Everyone turned to see a little boy
          standing with a glove.

<b>                    ISAAC

          That's me.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Right.  But everyone saw how small
          Isaac was and laughed... but not
          Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac
          carefully and then told him to join
          the game.  It came to the end of
          the game.  It was the eleventh or
          twelfth inning or whatever is the
          last inning of a game...

<b>                    ISAAC
</b>          Nine.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was
          losing and he was on base.  That's
          when Isaac came up.  He could
          barely hold the bat... Big Billy
          winked at Isaac... The ball was
          pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard.
          It soared up and out over the
          stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac
          hit a home run and won the game.
          After the game, Isaac asked Big
          Billy why he let he play.  Big
          Billy smiled and said, I wasn't
          always Big Billy, I was Little
          Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy
          went off after the game and read a
          classic book together.  The end.

<b>                    ISAAC
</b>          You know what -- that was a really
          good story... Tell it again.

Maurice has to smile as Isaac looks up anxiously.

The family dog "Max", scurries up and down with great
excitement.  Max can sense something big is happening.

The Caldwell clan, one and all has gathered at the end of
their driveway.  Maurice is escorted out by Isaac who clings
tightly to his hand.  Mr. Caldwell meets Maurice halfway and
pulls him aside.

<b>                    MR. CALDWELL
</b>          That's a nice watch.

Maurice looks down at his beat-up Seiko.

<b>                    MR. CALDWELL
</b>          I've always wanted a watch like
          that.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (unstrapping it)
          It's yours.

</b>          No.  I won't take it unless I pay
          for it... Let's see, that's a
          pretty nice watch -- I can see
          that.

Maurice watches him suspiciously as he pulls out an envelope
from his jacket pocket.

<b>                    MR. CALDWELL
</b>          Let's say I give you what's in this
          envelope for that beautiful watch.

Maurice is handed the envelope.  He opens it to find a thick
<b>PILE OF CASH, TENS AND TWENTIES.
</b>
<b>                    MR. CALDWELL
</b>          I really want that watch.

<b>                    MR. CALDWELL
</b>          This is my only chance to get a

          lot to me and my family.  Please
          take it.  It really isn't that
          much.

Maurice stares into the envelope emotionally and hands over
the watch tentatively.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          This is a loan.

Mr. Caldwell straps on the watch and then hugs Maurice.

The rest of the family say their good-byes.

Isaac won't let go of Maurice's hand as he walks out into the
street.

<b>                    MR. CALDWELL

Isaac just holds on tighter.  After Maurice and Isaac have
walked a few steps out into the street, Maurice kneels down.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I have to go now.

Isaac's bottom lip protrudes as he tries not to cry.  Maurice
has to hold back a few tears himself.  He hugs Isaac tightly.

</b>              (whispers)

Maurice pulls away from Isaac slowly.  Isaac runs to his

dirt.  Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment.

He makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough
room to lay down in the shade.  Maurice lays out slowly.  He
pries off his sneakers, band-aids and blisters cover every
inch of his feet.  Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers
and painfully pulls them back on.  His eyes close as he tries
to unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep.

Maurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the
hill... First WE SEE nothing, then some grains of sand escape
from the crack where the rock meets the hillside.  The CRACK

rock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of the
slope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt,
clutching his ribs.  The sun beats down on his stunned eyes.

Maurice stares up at the dizzying slope.  Sand still
trickling down to a stop.  He doesn't try to move for the

Maurice drags himself to sit upright.  The sharp pains
causing a distorted grimace on his face.  A short rest,

the spaces between his fingers.

Maurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg
goes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leg
instantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings to
the back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the verge

He glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE
miles away in the distance.  A car is moving in his
direction.

Maurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS
HEAD.  Maurice turns and looks through his tears...

There, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically
on the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.  It stands two and half
feet tall.  It spreads it's great wings.  The feathers expand
like a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          No.

This pacifies the driver somewhat.  He nods and gets in the
car.  Maurice watches as the car pulls away.

He turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone.  Maurice
looks up into the sky.  The Golden Eagle is flying
overhead... a tiny dot against the blazing sun.

Maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support.
Maurice takes his first step...

<b>EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Suburbia.  Rows of similar houses with small lawns and custom
mailboxes.  Beautiful trees line the streets creating a
canopy over the roadway.

Two women sit on a swing on the front porch of a small
suburban home.  JANIS AND AMMIE'S conversation is cut in mid
sentence.

<b>                    JANIS
</b>          Who is that?

          with him?

Janis and Ammie stare to the street where a sunburnt MAURICE
staggers in a daze.

<b>MAURICE'S POV
</b>
Maurice is on the edge of darkness... the trees and faces
swimming -- mixed with the colors of red and blue cloth
waving in the wind... Images come in and out of focus... two
women walking towards him... Maurice clutches his head as the
trees start to swim faster -- color, lights, houses...

Maurice lays still on a hospital bed.  His eyes slowly force
themselves open.

<b>                    NURSE (O.S.)
</b>          Good morning Mr. Parker.

Maurice turns his head to the side.  A pretty woman in her
late twenties, with LARGE LOCKS OF BROWN HAIR smiles back.
This is STEPHANIE.

<b>                    STEPHANIE
</b>          There are a lot of people worried
          about you.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (softly)
          Where am I?

<b>                    STEPHANIE
</b>          In a hospital.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Which hospital?  Did you take me
          back?

Stephanie understands his worry.

<b>                    STEPHANIE
</b>          You are in St. Vincent's Hospital
          in Roseville California.  You've
          been here three days.

Maurice closes his eyes in relief.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Thank God.

<b>INT.  HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON
</b>
The room is crowded.  Maurice is now propped up in a seated
position.  He tries to digest a set of fish sticks on a tray.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I can't believe you're here.  I'm
          touched.

Maurice looks across to ADELLE AND GERALD.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Are you two planning kids?

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          Maybe later.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          You should definitely have
          children.  They're really special.

Adelle and Gerald are in shock.  Maurice forks another fish
stick with a smile.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          I don't think you realize how
          serious this is Uncle.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          How serious is it?

DR. RAY, who has been standing by the window listening, steps
forward.

<b>                    DR. RAY
</b>          You have two broken ribs, a
          punctured spleen and Acute
          Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Maurice gives a comforting smile to Adelle.

<b>                    DR. RAY
</b>          The normal amount of build up in
          your arteries has been aggravated
          by over exertion.  This is called,
          "Claudication,"  As a result, there
          isn't enough circulation to your
          body.  That accounts for the
          discoloration in your extremities
          and the muscle spasms I'm sure
          you've encountered.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Can it kill me?

<b>                    DR. RAY
</b>          It can, but it'll have to wait in
          line.

This surprises Maurice.

<b>                    DR. RAY
</b>          We ran a C.T. and an M.R.I.  We
          found bleeding in your brain.  Your
          collapse was caused by "Transient
          Cerebral-Ischemia"... a sudden loss
          of blood circulation to the brain.
          In other words, Mr. Parker, you had
          a mild stroke.

There is dead silence in the room.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (scared)
          I suppose I over did it.

Adelle moves over to Maurice's side and holds his hand.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          What steps do we take now?

<b>                    DR. RAY
</b>          We operate.  We find the artery in
          the brain and close the bleeding...
          I just did this procedure on a
          Senator and he's doing fine.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          What are the odds?  Do I have a
          fifty-fifty chance of surviving the
          operation?

<b>                    DR. RAY
</b>          It's hard to say.  It's a delicate
          surgery.  There's no getting around
          the fact that it's a very high-risk
          situation.

Adelle strokes Maurice's hair.  Maurice stares down at his
food before looking up with great resolve.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Then it'll have to wait until I
          finish.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          What?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I finish the walk, and then we may
          take all the chances we want.

The room is stunned.  Adelle gets off the bed and collects
herself.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          Listen to me very carefully,
          because I don't want you to
          misunderstand me... The walk is
          over Uncle Maurice.  Done.
          Finished.  You've made it to
          California, it was a miracle, now
          let's try to save your life.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (louder)
          I'm completing the walk.  I'm
          almost there.

<b>                    DR. RAY
</b>          Okay, Maurice keep it calm...
              (beat)
          We can talk about this again, but
          just so you know, we have a guard
          on this floor who's sole job it is
          to keep an eye on you.

Maurice is crushed.

<b>                    DR. RAY
</b>          There are a lot of people out there
          who would like to see you finish,
          including me, but I'm not willing
          to put your life in anymore risk
          than it is... We do the operation,
          and when you're better, you finish
          the walk.

The room is dead again.  Maurice drowns in his thoughts.

<b>INT.  HOSPITAL CHAPEL - AFTERNOON
</b>
A small chapel.  Stain glass windows overlooking the parking
lot.  Maurice sits in his wheel chair at the back of the
room.  A few other patients are scattered in the four small
pews.

Maurice has his hands folded tightly and stares up at the
statue of Mary.  His concentration is broken as a man in a
full black suit and black shirt sits next to him.  Maurice
nods at the priest.

<b>                    PRIEST
</b>          Hello, Mr. Parker.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Hello.

<b>                    PRIEST
</b>          How are you feeling?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Confused.  I'm not sure what to do
          now.  I'm not sure what he wants
          for me.

<b>                    PRIEST
</b>          He wants to reward you... That's
          why I'm here.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>              (a little confused)
          What do you mean?

<b>                    PRIEST
</b>          I mean you've done a great thing.
          You should be rewarded monetarily.

Maurice is lost.

<b>                    PRIEST
</b>          What's your shoe size?

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          What?  Who are you?

The priest reaches into his jacket -- for the first time WE
SEE a Polo design on his shirt and a gaudy gold chain around
his neck.

<b>                    PRIEST
</b>          Clive Silver -- Marketing Executive
          at Reebok.

Maurice stares at the card in disbelief.

<b>                    CLIVE
</b>          We want you to do some spots for
          us.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          What the hell is this?

Some of the patients turn around.

<b>                    CLIVE
</b>          I'm talking six figures, pay or
          play -- for two spots.  We want to
          push a new line with you...
          America's New Hero.

Maurice is flustered.  He can't take this.  His eyes become
desperate.

Clive waves his hands in the air excitedly.

<b>                    CLIVE
</b>          Imagine grainy black and white
          shots of long stretches of highway
          -- quick cuts with a slow pounding
          beat underneath... Then we see a
          man walking up a steep incline --
          it's you Maurice.  We see shots of
          you walking.  Cut.  Cut.  Cut.

          Close up -- and you say...
          'Reebok, Because There's Nothing
          You Can't Do.'

Clive finishes.  He is surprised to find Maurice in tears.
Clive is thrown totally off as Maurice stares at him angrily
through streaming tears.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          My wife is dead.

Maurice continues his powerful gaze until Clive looks away.
Clive gathers his things and leaves the chapel without
another word.  Maurice drops his head into his hands and
cries quietly.

          you tomorrow.

Stephanie waits for a response from the motionless figure on
the bed.  She leaves the room a little disappointed.

WE MOVE CLOSER TO THE BED.  We see Maurice laying still --
the battered photo of Ellen clutches to his chest.

chair.  Kris bends down and hugs Maurice emotionally.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          I drove by the bookstore -- it's
          boarded up now.  There's a sign
          over the wood -- "Office space

The loss is evident on Maurice's eyes.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I haven't been too punctual with
          the rent.

<b>                    KRIS

          another store with investors.  I'm
          sure a lot of people would want to

Maurice forces a smile.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Actually, I'm not worried about my
          career right now... I'm more

Maurice sits back straight.  He looks upset.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          We do the operation after I finish.
          I can't risk not finishing... I

          doing.

</b>          I do.

</b>          Don't do this.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          ... To look me in the eye and say
          what's important to you isn't as
          important to me?  To tell me you
          know what's best?  To tell me life
          is more precious than what I feel
          for my wife?

Kris gets very emotional.  He rises from this chair.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if

Maurice turns to the window away from Kris.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          Your operation is scheduled for

Kris walks to the door and stops.

Maurice wheels himself into the hall from the waiting area.
He looks around.  His eyes lock on the EXIT SIGN over the
door at the end of the hall.  His eyes scan the area quickly.
He immediately finds the guard on the floor staring at him.
The guard nods ever so slightly as if to say, "I know what
you're thinking."  Maurice turns his attention to a small boy
in a hospital gown, being scolded by a head nurse.

<b>                    HEAD NURSE
</b>          You cooperate with us about taking
          your medicine and maybe we'll talk
          about candy.

The head nurse takes a chocolate bar out of the boy's tiny
hands.  The boy offers no response.  Maurice watches
curiously as STEPHANIE walks over and pats the boys head.
Maurice catches a small exchange -- Stephanie slips another
candy bar into his pocket.  The boy breaks into a warm smile.
Stephanie puts her fingers against her lips and winks.
Maurice takes this exchange in with great interest.

Stephanie throws a nervous smile to the guard as she escorts
a doctor down the hall... The doctor's oversized while lab
coat almost drags on the floor as he tries to hide the pain
of being on his feet.  MAURICE PARKER studies a bogus chart
in his hands.  His new glasses, sliding off his nose.  Beads
of sweat -- revealing his agony.

Three people in the elevator; Stephanie, Dr. Maurice Parker,
and a female physician.  The female doctor looks at Maurice
curiously, studying his demeanor -- she can't place him.

The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN on the third floor... The SOUND OF A
TV FLOODS THE ELEVATOR COMPARTMENT.  Maurice looks up in
horror to see a close-up of his FACE superimposed on the TV
screen seated on the receptionist's desk.  A man gets on the
elevator.

The female doctor stares at the TV as the doors close -- she
immediately turns to Maurice... her view is blocked by the
new passenger... the elevator progresses down 2... 1...
The female doctor leans forward trying to get a glimpse of
Maurice... THE BELL DINGS as the doors open on the ground
floor.

Doctor Maurice Parker and Stephanie quickly exit... the
female doctor stays in the elevator and watches carefully.

<b>                    FEMALE DOCTOR
</b>              (yells)
          Excuse me, doctor...

DOWN THE HALL... Maurice pauses and turns around -- fear
etched across his face.  The female doctor looks around the
barren hall then turns back to Maurice.

<b>                    FEMALE DOCTOR
</b>          Good luck.

The female doctor smiles as the doors shut.  After a few
moments of shock -- Maurice smiles back.

He turns back to Stephanie who stares back at him
emotionally.

          It's not too late.

Maurice gets out of the car painfully slow.  He pulls his
shoulder back upright with a laborious breath.  A sense of
pride returns to his face.  He turns back to Stephanie and
catches a horrified look.  He follows her stare...

She is staring at his shirt... He looks down to see a DARK
CRIMSON STAIN GROWING beneath the surface.  He covers the
area with his hand.

<b>                    MAURICE

She catches her breath.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          How does a grown man who can barely
          walk, just stroll out?... This is
          not James Bond here, this is my
          uncle who owns a bookstore, and
          gets outwitted by grade school kids
          pulling pranks!

Adelle notices the new people in the room.

<b>                    NEWTON
</b>          Mrs. Matlin, this is Sergeant
          Emory.  He'll help us find your

Adelle walks up to Emory.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          Let me tell you a story Sergeant.
          There was a patient of mine who had
          a Golden Retriever, Mac... She
          loved Mac, not like a pet, but like
          a family member.  One day, she had
          to leave Mac with 'friends', and
          wouldn't you know it, Mac gets away
          and ends up falling into a sewer.
          My patient comes back -- goes nuts
          when she hears that Mac has been in
          the sewer for over 48 hours.
          Apparently the cop who found the
          dog didn't want to get his pants
          dirty.  And neither did anyone
          else.  So of course, my patient
          decides to go in after it... she
          falls... breaks her hip and lands
          next to her dead dog, who died of
          toxic fumes down there...

Adelle looks around at all the engrossed faces.

<b>                    ADELLE
</b>          The moral of the story is... She
          sued for a lot of money!  She sued
          the friends, the city, and the
          officer for negligence on duty.
          She has no Mac, no happiness, but
          she's very rich now... That was a
          dog.  We're talking about a human
          being...
              (beat)
          I hope everyone clearly understands
          the chain of events that will occur
          if something should happen to my
          uncle, whom I love more than you
          can possibly imagine... Now
          Sergeant I would like to know right
          now, if you're willing to get your
          pants dirty for my uncle?

Adelle and Emory have a staring contest.  Adelle wins.
Adelle stands alone in a room with four men, and she is
clearly the one in charge.

The door flies open.  A police officer walks in pushing KRIS
REDDY through the door.

<b>                    OFFICER
</b>          I found him sneaking up the back
          stairs with this.

The officer holds out a long coat and hat.  Emory walks up to
Kris.

<b>                    EMORY
</b>          Did you help Mr. Parker leave this
          hospital?

Kris looks to the empty bed and smiles... a BIG SMILE.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          No... But I was going to.

<b>                    EMORY
</b>          Forget him.  It's time to get our
          pants dirty.

Adelle smiles.

sidewalk... Starts toward them... Kris sees something through
the thinner parts of the crowd... something laying on the
sidewalk... A man!  Kris' walk turns into a sprint.

Kris works his way through the growing crowd, puncturing the
center of the circle... Kris gazes down at the man writhing
on the concrete... A black man, shaking uncontrollably.  A
women standing over the fallen man waves the crowd back.

invisible in this crowd.  He presses something to his injured
side.  His condition has worsened.

He eyes the entrance where a POLICE OFFICER walks in and
moves to the serving counter.  The officer asks the serving
lady something, and shows her a picture.  She shrugs her
shoulders and continues serving.  The cop takes one last look
around the hundreds of hungry people leaving the room.

Maurice pulls up his hand from underneath his shirt.  The
napkin he was holding at his side is SATURATED WITH BLOOD.
Maurice replaces it with a clean napkin.

Newspapers spiral through the air.  Maurice stretches his
neck up, squinting at the sun.  The SILHOUETTE OF A
HELICOPTER hovers above him.  The NOISE is overpowering.

Maurice's fatigue grows, every muscle, every ounce of energy
goes into each step.  Maurice clutches the side of his
head... the steps halted... hands trembling, teeth clenched,
eyes squeezed shut.  A surge of intense pain tries to buckle
him... Maurice fights it off as he moves his feet again.

The helicopter SWOOPS above as he makes his turn onto a FINAL
STRETCH OF ROAD adjacent to the BEACH.

Maurice stops dead in his tracks as he turns the corner to
find a SEA OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR HIM.  A momentous sight...
people lined along the street for as far as the eye can see.
<b>AN EXPLOSION OF YELLING, CHEERING CALIFORNIAN'S ENGULFS THE
</b>AIR as they spot Maurice standing at the end of the street.
The CROWD SURGES TOWARDS HIM.

Maurice is dazed... the noise, the pain, the faces swirl in
his head as thousands of people surround him.  Maurice is
overwhelmed.  He is about to collapse when someone takes hold
of his arm.  Maurice turns to see KRIS REDDY STANDING NEXT TO
HIM.  In the midst of this chaos and growing madness.
Maurice and Kris have an entire conversation with one
emotional look.

The SOUNDS of SIRENS BREAK the moment.  Kris turns to see two
police cars turn on the street behind them.

Kris turns to Maurice.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          Don't stop walking.

Kris lets go of his arm and moves like lightning.  He jumps
atop a fire-hydrant and yells to the crowd.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          The police are here.  They're
          coming to take Mr. Parker away.  He
          needs our help.

Kris points to the squad cars inching their way up the
street.

<b>                    KRIS
</b>          Help Mr. Parker!  Don't let them
          end the walk.

          step aside now!

The people don't move.  A WOMAN carrying a BABY makes the
baby move her little hand in a waving gesture to the officers
behind the wheel of the police cars.  The officers look at
each other in disbelief.

The far end of the beach road.  A POLICE CAR SCREECHES TO A
STOP.  Sergeant Emory and Adelle get out.

Adelle is completely blown away.  She looks around at the
PANDEMONIUM.  Thousands of men, women and children
celebrating with APPLAUSE AND CHEERS, HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR,
camera crews standing on raised platforms.  Adelle drinks in
the ELECTRIC ATMOSPHERE with awe.

Emory yells orders into his WALKIE-TALKIE as Adelle breaks
the outer edge of the crowd and disappears into the field of
spectators.

Emory CLICKS OFF and looks around at the growing crowd -- he
turns to see a PUBLIC BUS UNLOADING PASSENGERS -- fifty more
spectators rush off the bus and rush toward the crowded
street.

one side of the street for an entire block.  Stretched over

sweat falling from his brow.  People in the crowd cover their
mouths in shock as they get a clear view of him... His shirt
soaked on one side with blood, his entire body shaking with
pain, and exhaustion, his face hollow and pale -- ghostly.

Maurice stops in his tracks.  He looks up at a wooden sign,
worn from the years of salt water air.  The sign reads:

</b>          I don't know.

<b>                    ELLEN

Someone blocks his way.

shirt and her hand comes away with blood.

</b>          I have to finish first.

<b>                    ADELLE

him.  He barely manages to get the words out.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          It has nothing to do with you
          either... This is between Ellen and

Beat.  Maurice begins crying uncontrollably.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          I'm begging you...

Maurice takes her hand and bends down putting his forehead to
her hand as if getting blessings from her.

<b>                    MAURICE
</b>          Let me do this for Ellen, let me do
          this for my wife.

Adelle's heart is breaking.  She weeps openly as she
straightens her Uncle to an upright position.  She wipes the
tears from his eyes with her hand gently.

<b>AT THAT MOMENT THE INNER CIRCLE BREAKS OPEN AS TWO OFFICERS

Adelle stands firm, the strength in her growing with each
second.

<b>                    ADELLE

The officers are taken off guard.  They look around at the

anything and moves to Maurice's side.

Maurice begins to walk again.  Adelle to one side, Kris to

Kneeling in the water, Maurice raises his hands to his eyes.
The water spills between his fingers... clear, pure, magical.

Maurice GASPS hard as he falls onto his back.  The water
