          starts removing the letters.

          POP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling.
          TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for
          position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note:
          female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.)
          PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers.
          He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking.

</b>          Well, it's been another great year here
          at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus'
          haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you.
          SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly
          enjoying the small compliment.

<b>                         SANDY
</b>          I ain't afraid of no ghost.
          The other teachers laugh.

<b>          VOICE (O.C.)
</b>          Wally, can I just say one quick thing?
          Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and
          wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is
          wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students
          and adults alike -- like students.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Just wanted to remind everyone the school
          day's not over. So let's keep the
          drinking under control, hmm? That's it.
          Back to you, Wally.
          A bunch of teacher roll their eyes.

          . Or the wild success of the book drive
          for the women's prison sponsored by Ms.

          A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS. SAVICKI, nods.

</b>          But now as the summer is upon us, it's
          time to not only say goodbye to another
          school year, but to also say goodbye to a
          member of our faculty.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Elizabeth, can you come up here?
          ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to
          the front. She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses
          slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          You've only been with us for one short
          year, but know that you'll always be a
          part of the JAMS family.
          Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile.
          The Teachers lightly applaud.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          And we got you a little something.
          Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and.
          pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Almost forty dollars. Thank you!

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Why don't you say a couple words?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this
          type of thing so I'll make it quick. I
          know I've only been here a year, but
          there's so much I'm going to miss...

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
          Elizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing
          the few personal effects she has into a banker's box.

</b>          My students, probably most of all.I'm not
          saying they were little angels, butthey
          were all there to learn and that'sthe
          greatest gift a student can give a teacher.
          Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last
          days of seventh grade.
          A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with
          his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who
          considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she
          signs it.

<b>          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box.
          SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her,
          running toward their summer vacation.

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          And I wish that I had gotten to know all of
          you better, but between four classes and
          planning a wedding, I had my hands full.
          From the little I do know about you, I know
          that our students are in good hands.
          Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully
          removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling
          them into cardboard tubes.

<b>          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
          Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a
          thicket on the outskirts of the school property.

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          And I can't believe it's all over. This
          year flew by. And even though I'll never
          teach again professionally, I've realized
          that I don't need a blackboard and
          classroom to set an example.
          Elizabeth comes up behind them.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Hand it over.
          The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of
          the burnouts hands her the joint.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Everything.
          The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
          a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          This was a warning. Next time, I don't
          call the principal. I call the cops.

<b>          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
          Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in,
          pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE,
          and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's
          box out the window and extends her hand, giving the
          school THE FINGER.

<b>          ELIZABETH (O.S.)
</b>          Woo-hoo!
          A couple students look at her strangely.

<b>                         ANGLE ON
</b>          The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook.
          He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of
          Elizabeth is her message: "YOU ARE ILLITERATE!"

          You are... Illit... Illit...
          Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly
          hits him.
          She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the
          JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic
          letters to read, "HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!"

          A Mercedes with the vanity plate "HIS" is parked in the
          driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching
          Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate
          reads "HERS."

          Elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip.

</b>          Coming!
          MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear.
          He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and
          is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth.
          Thankfully for him, he has money.

<b>                         (ANXIOUS)
</b>          Hey! That was a quick party.
          Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands
          him a glass.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Yeah. You should have seen it. What a
          joke.
          She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.

</b>          Here's to me never having to work again.
          And I owe it all to you, Lover.
          Elizabeth takes a big sip.

<b>                         (FLIRTATIOUS)

          Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns
          towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into --

<b>          INT. TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Elizabeth enters to find -- NOTHING. Mark follows her in.

</b>          See? Nothing.
          Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES.
          Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only
          in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands,
          revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          I'm not. And you know why? Because

          with a silver spoon in our mouths. You

<b>                         MARK

<b>                         ELIZABETH

          I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to
          settle down. And they all wear condoms.
          And then they take the condoms with them.
          That's how paranoid they are that a girl

</b>          Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with
          the cole slaw.

</b>          You weren't at the orientation the other
          day, but we're doing something new this
          year. It's very exciting. We're
          splitting the cafeteria into quadrants.
          Elizabeth yawns.

<b>                         AMY (CONT'D)
</b>          So, anyways, in order for the quadrant
          system to work, it's vital that each
          teacher maintain order within their
          quadrant. Because it's really tough for
          me as head lunch monitor -- or another
          teacher -- to leave their quadrant to
          discipline a kid in another quadrant. I
          know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy
          to sit with-you after school and explain
          all of the new guidelines.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Tell you what. Why don't you send me a
          memo, and if I have any questions, I'll
          come to you.

</b>          Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to
          tell you how to run your class, but maybe
          it might be fun to do some ice-breakers.
          Like "Telephone Charades" or "The String
          Game." Or start doing practice questions
          for the state test. It's never too soon

          was really hoping that we could be more

          Yeah, Silly, I meant after.

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>          Cool! Let's get a group together.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us.
          Scott looks around, then lowers his voice.

</b>          Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered.
          You're one of the nicest people I've met
          here. But... I'm actually seeing
          someone.

</b>          Because she's ugly?

</b>          No. She's beautiful. She's great. She
          really cares about the kids. It's
          just... when you're dating a co-worker...

          Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a
          frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl. Amy looks
          up, smiles and gives a thumbs up to Elizabeth and Scott,
          signalling that everything's okay with the girl. Elizabeth
          NOTICES Amy's LARGE BREASTS straining against her blouse.
          She quietly seethes.

          Elizabeth is up front. She's staring,at the PARENTS.
          They stare right back at her. It's awkwardly silent for
          a beat too long.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey.
          Soooooo... Any questions?
          Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points
          to her.

<b>                         SASHA'S MOTHER
</b>          Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each
          other at the carwash. I'm a little
          concerned with the importance you're
          placing on movies. What about the state
          test?
          Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't
          Question My Authority."

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          That's exactly what I say to my students.
          Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school
          hired me because I'm good at what I do.
          (as the parents take this in)
          And the reason your son loves my class is
          because I inspire him. Movies are one
          tool that I use. I also use other
          multimedia techniques, which I'm not
          going to get into right now. Look, I
          could take you day by day through my
          entire syllabus, but that's not how I do
          things. I'm not one of these stuffy
          teachers who's totally by the book. I
          talk to the kids like they're little
          adults. It's about mutual respect. So
          that's my spiel, as the Jews say.

          A "refreshments" table. A lonely package of OREOS rests
          against a PITCHER OF TAP WATER.
          Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by
          a sharply dressed PARENT.

<b>                         PARENT #1
</b>          Excuse me, Ms. Halsey.

<b>                         (EXTENDING HAND)
</b>          I'm Chris' dad.
          From Elizabeth's reaction, she clearly has no idea who
          Chris is.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Chris... Great kid -- and precocious.
          You must be so proud.

<b>                         CHRIS' DAD
</b>          Oh, what a relief. I just wish his
          grades would reflect it.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          If I know Chris, he'll get there.

<b>                         CHRIS' DAD
</b>          Listen, I know you have a full plate, but
          if you could keep an eye on Chris, my
          wife and I would really appreciate it.
          Chris' dad shakes her hand. Elizabeth opens her hand,
          sees a tightly folded HUNDRED DOLLAR bill. She looks
          back up at Chris' dad.

          QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth opens her refrigerator. Nothing
          except ketchup packets, mustard packets and soy sauce
          packets.
          She reaches for her bong and tries lighting it. Once.
          Twice. She shakes the lighter. No luck.
          She carries the bong to the stove, turns on the stove,
          and tries lighting it from there. No luck.

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Are you fucking kidding me?
          Elizabeth crosses out with one line, so it's
          clearly visible beneath. From out in the hallway, we
          HEAR the loud, aggressive BARKING of the DOGS. Tristan
          runs to the door and peeks out.

<b>                         SPENCER
</b>          Whoa. Drug dogs. Cool.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Sit down.
          Elizabeth races to the window.

<b>                         ELIZABETH'S POV
</b>          The Police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next
          to hers. Elizabeth glances back at her pocketbook.

<b>                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          Balls.
          She races back to her desk.

</b>          Keep reading.
          Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk,
          obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook
          and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we
          SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS.
          Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her
          mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her
          way through the second and then the third, the chewing
          becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder.
          Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police
          Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by
          Principal Snur and Amy.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This
          will only take a second.
          Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs
          her cough syrup and takes a huge swig. Elizabeth wipes
          her mouth, breathes normally.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Sorry. I had something caught in my
          throat.
          The German Shepherd continues barking.

<b>                         POLICE OFFICER #1
</b>          What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy?
          The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go
          wide. Amy licks her lips. The Dog sideswipes Elizabeth,
          almost knocking her over, and jumps onto Garrett.

<b>                         GARRETT
</b>          Ahhh!!!
          The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag
          and pulls out an opened bag of CORN CHIPS.

<b>                         POLICE OFFICER #1
</b>          (holding up Corn Chips)
          All clear. Dog must've responded to
          these. Happens.
          Elizabeth glares at Amy -- "I know you were behind this."
          Amy glares back.
          Principal Snur looks at Amy and shakes his head.

          Even though that wasn't drugs, junk food
          is still contraband. That's detention,
          Buster.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          Enough, Amy. I think it's time we call
          off this witch-hunt.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          (pointedly to Amy)
          Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll
          excuse me, my class has a state test to
          prepare for.
          Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit.
          Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once,
          the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Whoa.

<b>                         CHASE
</b>          Are you okay, Ms. Halsey?
          Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Class dismissed.

<b>                         SASHA

</b>          Get out of my face.
          (then, to Garrett)
          And leave the corn chips.
          The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out.
          From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES
          idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she
          still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

</b>
          Elizabeth is asleep at her desk. She wakes with a jolt.
          A paper is stuck to her face.
          She looks again at the stack of work, then at the pile of
          things she's already corrected. There's FOUR.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Balls!
          She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground.
          After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the,
          papers off the floor. As she starts tossing them into
          the trash, something catches her eye: a PRACTICE TEST
          MANUAL. And in the corner, an address:

<b>                         54 LAKEVIEW STREET
</b>          Peoria Il, 61602

<b>                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it.

<b>          ELIZABETH (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)

<b>          I/E. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          Unfortunately, I can't make it in today.
          My grandmother took a turn for the worse
          and it looks like she's dead.

<b>          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
          The kids are laughing and engaged. TURN TO REVEAL SCOTT,
          dressed in overalls and a straw hat with a piece of hay
          in his mouth, animatedly teaching. He's holding a copy
          of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."

<b>          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
</b>          Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral. Wish
          me luck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          EXT. SIGMA NU - MOMENTS LATER

          Elizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a
          backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees.

<b>                         FRAT GUY

<b>                         ELIZABETH

<b>                         FRAT GUY

<b>                         (DISAPPOINTED)
</b>          Yeah, hold on. T-baaaaag! Someone's

          (then, back to Elizabeth)
          So you coming to our "CEOs and Corporate
          Ho's" party tonight?
          Elizabeth just stares at the Frat Guy. He turns away.
          Tucker, dressed identically to the Frat Guy but twenty
          pounds overweight, hustles down the stairs. He has a
          tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>
<b>          INT. SIGMA NU - TUCKER'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          Tucker sits on his bed. Elizabeth leans against a desk,
          unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room.
          BOB MARLEY plays softly.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          Do you ever talk to my brother?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          No. He dumped me, remember?

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          You and my brother always had the
          histrionics.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          So, do you want to come to our party
          tonight? "CEOs and Corporate Ho's?"
          We're kinda light on Ho's.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Like I told "Frat Guy #1," I'm not
          interested.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         TUCKER

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          I need some date rape drugs.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          (hurt, defensive)
          Two things. Number one: who do you think
          I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah,
          I'm in an awesome frat, but that really
          hurts. And two: they're not "date rape"
          drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for
          weightlifting. It helps build mass,
          okay? Why do you even want it?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (DEADPAN)
</b>          For lifting.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          I have money and I'm in a rush.
          She takes out a wad of cash.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          That's all you needed to say. No need to
          get all histrionic on me.
          Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a
          small lockbox. He unlocks it and takes out a small
          bottle containing a clear liquid.

<b>                         TUCKER (CONT'D)
</b>          One capful makes you feel really good.
          Two capfuls will knock her out for a
          couple hours. You don't want to take any
          more than two.
          Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and
          then gives her a big, warm hug.

<b>                         TUCKER (CONT'D)
</b>          Listen, I know you and my brother aren't
          together anymore, but I still think of
          you as a sister, okay?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Get your hand off my ass.

<b>                         TUCKER
</b>          Sorry, didn't even know I put it down
          there. Good luck with your lifting.

          Carl holds up a lanyard with a STATE ID CARD and some

          Elizabeth gives Carl "fuck me" eyes. He nervously sips

          Carl goes to fiddle with his computer. Elizabeth quickly
          reaches into her purse and pulls out the bottle of GHB.
          She pours a little into Carl's wine. And then a little
          bit more. As he turns around, she hands him the glass.

          Carl smiles as he feebly chases after her. He. stops at
          the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then
          passes out, STILL STANDING.
          Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back
          into his office. She goes over to the filing cabinets,
          unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling. She

          collapses on the ground -- out cold. She copies the test and
          puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf.
          She takes a post-it, scribbles something and sticks it to

          stopped talking to me in fifth grade, I
          don't care. I remember the Chase that
          wrote me a card when my dad was
          overweight and had to go to the hospital
          because of his heart --

<b>                         (CONTINUING)
</b>          And then, a year later, when he left my
          mom and moved in with his trainer, you
          wrote me another card. What happened to
          us? Remember when we had a sleepover in
          the second grade and you wet your bed and
          you were so embarrassed and you made me
          promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I
          never did and I never will. I know we're
          really young, but remember Romeo and
          Juliet were only 13. A lot of people
          don't know that. So there it is. My
          heart on a sleeve.

</b>          Your administration jumped to
          conclusions, set off a media fire-storm
          and has humiliated one of its own. As
          Ms. .Halsey's chief counsel, I've advised
          her that we have an extremely strong case
          of libel and that it's certainly within
          her province to sue the district.

</b>          Ms. Halsey is not a litigious woman. She

          Oh, and I should mention that if this
          goes to trial, I can cry on cue.
          Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast.
          And as quickly she started, she stops.

</b>
          Elizabeth heads down the empty hallway. From the auditorium,
          the faint sound of "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" from "Annie" can be
          heard.
          Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song.
          She notices Elizabeth coming to her. Amy debates her options.

<b>                         AMY
</b>          Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave
          us quite a scare, you did.
          Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking
          toward Amy, only feet away now.

</b>          (attempting some levity)
          Somebody's being a grumple--
          BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops
          to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood.

          QUICK CUTS. The year is winding down. Instead of gym,
          kids are using the time to sign each other's yearbooks.
          Chase walks up to Garrett with her yearbook, asks him to
          sign it.

</b>
          QUICK CUTS. It's class photo day. With each FLASH, we
          SEE a different TEACHER with a different CLASS.
          And finally AMY, with a bandage over her nose and two
          black eyes, smiles widely alongside her CLASS.

</b>
          Much like the first scene of the movie. The teachers are
          sipping plastic flutes of Champagne. Principal Snur is
          up front. Elizabeth lingers in the back.

<b>                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
</b>          I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s.
          Polite laughter.

<b>          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
</b>          But seriously... With summer around the
          corner, it's time to not only say goodbye
          to another school year, but to also say
          goodbye to one of our own.
          Elizabeth smiles.

</b>          Amy Squirrel.
          Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a
          pursed smile.

</b>          After six short years of outstanding,

          continue.

</b>          When the superintendent personally asks
          you to work at one of the worst schools
          in the state, you say yes. I'm looking
          forward to bringing my brand of zany
          energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for
          learning to the underprivileged students
          at Malcolm X High. I welcome the
          challenge.
          The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic.
          Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Here, I got you this.
          Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and
          unravels the "Integrity" poster that Elizabeth stole.

</b>          And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it.
          Elizabeth heads for the door. Scott catches up to her.

          Listen, now that Amy's transferring,
          maybe the two of us could go grab a

          Quick cuts. From behind, we see Elizabeth place an APPLE
          on each desk, just as Amy did earlier.
          Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed
          photo of Amy's class picture, with Amy's messed up face,
          from the year before.

          students as they reconnect with friends and share stories
          about summer camp.
          She notices Sasha who is MASSAGING a BOY's shoulders.
          bunch of other EIGHTH GRADE BOYS wait their turn.

          Sasha clearly enjoys the attention. Elizabeth smiles.
          Garrett walks by, hand in hand with Chase. Trailing both
          of them are identical rolling backpacks. He sees
          Elizabeth and runs over.
