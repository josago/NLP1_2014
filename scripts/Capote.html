<b>               EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
</b>
               The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty 
               Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At 
               the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The 
               girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting 
               in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs, 
               motions for her to go inside.

               The girl walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen, 
               the PHONE is OFF the hook. The girl looks back toward the 
               open front door. She turns toward the stairs, climbs them.

<b>               INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               She walks down the hall to a BEDROOM DOOR at the end. The 
               door is slightly ajar. She knocks, then enters the room.

               The girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high 
               school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the 
               bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope, 
               SHOT in the head. There is blood on the wall. The sixteen 
               year-old girl stands immobile. Before she starts to scream,

               The friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people 
               are coming in and out -- talking and drinking and laughing.

                         of his book, and he says to me: the 
                         writing's going well, but I just 
                         want to make sure it's not one of 
                         those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, 
                         your novel's about a Negro homosexual 
                         who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't

               Laughter. We see Truman watching everyone laugh. GRAYSON 
               notices, leans in to him. As the rest of the group continues 
               talking, we come closer, hear their conversation.

               Truman sits with his coffee, reading the New York Times. An 
               article catches his eye. He sits up straight, folds the paper 
               over, reads it.

               C/U of article being snipped out of PAGE 39 of the Times, 
               November 16, 1959. As the page gets turned around with each 
               snip, we see a small PHOTO of a middle-aged man wearing 
               glasses, with the caption: "FOUND DEAD: Herbert W. Clutter, 
               a wealthy Kansas farmer..." We read the headline: "WEALTHY

               Truman on the phone, on a long cord, travels between the

               of the room as he says each bit.

               smart, tough, sensible. Truman smiles.

               In the reception area, ALVIN DEWEY and the two other KBI 
               AGENTS assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets 
               on and straightening their ties. They've completely taken 
               over the office. They are: HAROLD "Brother" NYE (34); and 
               ROY "Curly CHURCH (60 - bald). They all smoke.

               Sheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is 
               office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on 
               the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the 
               background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED 
               ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as:

                         house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's 
                         got a couch upstairs in his apartment. 
                         I'll stay with him and Dorothy till 
                         we're done here."

               WALTER looks uncomfortable. Dewey shakes his head at Church.

               Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up 
               to a group of THREE GIRLS.

               The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY 
               (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall, 
<b>               17).

               Truman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura 
               backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman, 
               looks at him for several moments.

               Truman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home. He removes 
               his hat, slips past the few people standing outside.

               Warm but slightly tacky. Some people are engaged in hushed 
               conversation at the reception area. Truman slips past, into 
               the back room.

</b>
               No people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the 
               room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to 
               make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the 
               caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy-
               blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of 
               white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance -- 
               like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares.

               stops a few feet in front of her. Nelle refuses to smile.

                         see that Joe was in even worse shape 
                         than I was. He grabbed my hands and 
                         sat me down at the kitchen table, 
                         and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about 
                         anything, any subject in the world. 
                         Don't worry whether it will interest

                         to be alone with his thoughts. It

               OVER BLACK SCREEN we hear the voice of a RADIO ANNOUNCER.

<b>                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>                         ...This is KERG radio, Garden City. 
                         A friendly broadcast from a friendly 
                         place. Our lead story:

               Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.

               FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front 
               seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people. 
               Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the 
               headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob." 
               The CAR RADIO is on.

<b>                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

                         scores of Kansans as they await the 
                         arrival of confessed killers Perry 
                         Smith and Richard Hickock. KBI 
                         officers have been driving the Clutter

                         from...

               Truman moves from the car into the large crowd. Old ladies; 
               ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists 
               INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom 
               of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as 
               we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a 
               MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in 
               an overcoat CRYING silently.

               Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together 
               at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the 
               photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --

<b>                                     NELLE
</b>                         Hey.

               We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A 
               CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to 
               the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the 
               lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens 
               the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers 
               get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and 
               lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.

               Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. 
               They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, 
               ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American 
               Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As 
               he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as 
               if they are arthritic. Truman stares.

                         Alvin told me.

               Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of 
               the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. 
               His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look 
               at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the 
               steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.

               FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and 
               a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says "SHERIFF'S

                         And I have literature. My friend 
                         Jack mailed me the book you wanted.

               He presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the 
               inscription inside.

                         Truman."

               It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of 
               it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily 
               on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS.

<b>                                     DOROTHY
</b>                         You're too much. Go on into the living 
                         room, lemme grab that -- it's been 
                         ringing all morning.

<b>               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; 
               to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- 
               she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.

<b>               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. 
               On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the 
               cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)

               Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his 
               head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. 
               The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely 
               kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several 
               moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:

<b>                                     DOROTHY
</b>                         Oh. Truman. I meant in there.
                              (points to living 
                              room)
                         I... um...

               Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs.

<b>                                     DOROTHY
</b>                         It's the women's cell. It's hardly 
                         ever used. But they wanted to, um, 
                         separate... Please. Let's sit in the 
                         living room. I'll set up in the living 
                         room.

               She gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS.

</b>                         Come.

               She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers.

</b>                         Among other indignities.

               Perry's voice is oddly high, whispery -- special words are 
               precisely enunciated.

               Truman looks at Dorothy, looks back at Perry.

               Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel. 
               The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the 
               defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their 
               aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).

               Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at 
               the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece 
               of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a 
               LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry --

                         Hickock, is that your wish?

               Hickock looks at Weeks. Weeks nods. Hickock stands.

               Crowd gets up. Much talk. Truman watches Perry and Dick 
               through the forest of bodies. They are led away in handcuffs. 
               Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things -- 
               he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers. Truman 
               watches.

               Truman is caught. He smiles.

<b>               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Truman sits near the bars of the cell. Perry draws on a scrap 
               of paper at the small table. Dorothy watches from the door 
               to the living room. The BOOK Truman gave to Dorothy lies on 
               the floor next to Perry's meticulously made bed.

               Perry doesn't answer. Dorothy checks her watch, leaves. Truman 
               takes a bottle of BAYER ASPIRIN out of his pocket.

               Perry extends his hand through the bars. As Truman shakes 
               some aspirin into it --

               Perry puts the aspirin in his mouth, CHEWS THEM, holds out 
               his hand for more. Truman gives him more, which Perry puts 
               in his pocket for later.

                         "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing 
                         a different path -- by inventing an 
                         entirely new kind of writing: the 
                         non-fiction novel.

               Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now.

</b>                         On the night of November 14, two men 
                         broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas 
                         and murdered an entire family. Why 
                         did they do that? It's been suggested 
                         that this subject is tawdry -- it's 
                         not worthy of literature. I disagree. 
                         Two worlds exist in this country -- 
                         the quiet conservative life, and the 
                         life of those two men -- the 
                         underbelly, the criminally violent. 
                         Those worlds converged that bloody 
                         night. I spent the past three months 
                         interviewing everyone in Kansas 
                         touched by that violence. I spent 
                         hours talking to the killers -- and 
                         I'll spend more.

                         Researching this work has changed my 
                         life, altered my point of view about

               Truman waits alone, looking at the lone decoration: a campaign

               Truman leans close to Perry, whispers:

               Perry sleeps. Truman stands against the wall watching him. 
               He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's 
               desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY 
               OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them, 
               he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good. 
               Truman touches it.

               Perry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting.

               Perry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed, 
               looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief. 
               Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a 
               photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly.

</b>                         We're not so different as you might 
                         think. I was abandoned repeatedly as 
                         a child. My mama'd drag me along to 
                         some new town so she could take up 
                         with another man she'd met. Night 
                         after night she'd lock me in the 
                         hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch 
                         and tell the staff not to let me out 
                         no matter what. I was terrified -- 
                         I'd scream my head off -- till finally 
                         I'd collapse on the carpet next to 
                         the door and fall asleep. After years 
                         of this she just left me with 
                         relatives in Alabama.

               A moment, then Perry reaches for the NOTEBOOKS, hands them 
               to Truman. Then he hands Truman the DRAWING he did of himself.

               Truman walks down the hall. He passes Dick's cell. Dick is 
               lying in bed. Dick rises and smiles widely at Truman.

               Truman smiles, puts HIS FINGERS TO HIS LIPS, continues past. 
               He stops outside Perry's cell. Perry (looking MUCH HEALTHIER) 
               is drawing at his table -- a picture of the HUGE YELLOW PARROT 
               swooping down from the sky. Truman watches for a few moments, 
               then Perry looks at him.

                         shivering -- just trying to get 
                         through the night. The Sister pulled 
                         back the covers and shined her 
                         flashlight to see what I'd did. The 
                         sheets were wet. She hit me so many 
                         times with that flashlight she broke 
                         it.
                              (he shrugs)
                         That night I dreamed about the yellow 
                         bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It 
                         picked me up and it clawed the Nun's 
                         eyes and it lifted me into the sky.

               They look at each other.

               his cell. He crouches, puts his hand through the bars and 
               touches the cover of the new dictionary. He's alone.

                         they crossed the prairies and passed 
                         through Holcomb: windows ablaze, 
                         almost every window in almost every 
                         house, and, in the brightly lit rooms, 
                         fully clothed people, even entire

                         wide awake, watchful, listening. Of 
                         what were they frightened? "It might 
                         happen again."

               He closes his manuscript. Several moments of SILENCE, then 
               thunderous APPLAUSE.

               back, then looks to Truman who seems upset.

               Huge. Dirt floor. Wooden gallows. TWENTY MEN stand around, 
               some smoking. Some are silent. Some whisper quietly.

               Journalists. Also, Alvin Dewey and the KBI men: Church and 
               Nye. Krutch in front of the gallows with a CHAPLAIN. At the 
               foot of the gallows steps, the EXECUTIONER -- thin, older, a 
               too-large pin-striped suit and stained cowboy hat. Truman. 
               William Shawn.

               HEADLIGHTS, then a PRISON CAR enters, stops. Dick is extracted 
               from the back seat. He stands, looks at the CROWD, then at 
               the GALLOWS. The Guards nudge him forward.

<b>               INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

               CLOCK reads 12:05pm. Perry sits alone looking at his hands. 
               We HEAR A TRAP DOOR SPRING and CLATTER. Perry looks up.

</b>
               Light rain outside. Perry in the back seat being driven across 
               the yard. He looks out his window, sees a PICKUP TRUCK drive 
               out of the Corner Warehouse. On it: a BODY covered by a BLACK 
<b>               CLOTH.

<b>               INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The PRISON CAR enters, stops. Perry is removed from the back 
               seat. He stands, looks at the assembled men, looks at Truman. 
               He's nudged forward. As he passes DEWEY, he extends his hand:

               Dewey is caught off-guard so shakes his hand. Perry is led 
               to the base of the gallows.

               Perry is disappointed by this information.

                         say for the life of me...

               He stops. Several moments.

               Krutch can't tell if he's done. Finally, Krutch nods to the 
               Guard. Perry is led up the STEPS. The Chaplain follows.

                         evil, for thou art with me.

               The Executioner puts the NOOSE around Perry's neck. Perry 
               chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK.

               Perry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the 
               crowd, at Truman.

<b>                                     CHAPLAIN
</b>                         Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort 
                         me.

               The BLACK SACK goes over Perry's head. Truman watches. He 
               stands next to Alvin Dewey.

                         annointest my head with oil.

               The Executioner pulls the handle, Perry drops.

               twenty men watching Perry Smith hang, the Chaplain reading.

               Truman, seated on the aisle, next to William Shawn. After a 
               long silence, he extracts from his leather briefcase a PACKAGE 
               wrapped in BROWN PAPER. Hands it to Truman.

                         told them I'd give it to you.

               The package says KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY and is addressed 
               to Truman. Truman opens it.

               He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL 
               DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds 
               Perry's final entry. He READS silently. We hear Perry's VOICE:

               Truman turns the page. It's BLANK. He closes the Diary.

               We CONTINUE to hear Perry's VOICE as Truman takes out a 
               SNAPSHOT -- the one of Perry (at age 3) and Linda splashing 
               in the puddle.

                         have...

               Truman takes out a PENCIL DRAWING Perry did of him. It's 
               very good, though Truman looks old and weary in it.

               Truman finds, at the bottom of the package, his TIE. He takes 
               it out, clutches it.

               Truman grasps for William Shawn's HAND, finds it, holds on 
               tightly. Shawn sits stoically, hoping no one will notice.

               The CAMERA pulls back, up the aisle. Truman clutches the 
               tie, and holds on to Shawn's hand, for dear life.

               TITLE UP: (each title fades up in succession)

               In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in 
               America.

               He never finished another book.

               The epigraph he chose for his last published work reads: 
               "More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered 
               ones. "

               He died in 1984 of complications due to alcoholism.
