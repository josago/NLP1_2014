     A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of
     railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a
     scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings -

     a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting
     and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver.

     Henrik Vanger - at 82, even older than Morell - listens
     to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled
     room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan.

     There's nothing more to say. Vanger sets the receiver
     down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame
     resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in.
     It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now
     burst outside -

     Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of
     reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building.
     As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing
     in his direction. Without stopping -

     Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime,
     which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his
     umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him -

     At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee,
     and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself
     fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV. He's the only
     one there who watches it - no one else is interested -
     which only makes it worse.

</b>              In an article published earlier
              this year, Blomkvist claimed
              Wennerstrom - founder and president
              of The Wennerstrom Group - used State
              funds intended for industrial
              development in Poland for an arms
              deal with the right-wing Ustashe in
              Croatia.

    The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the
    courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal
    team, confidently addressing the reporters -

<b>                            WENNERSTROM ON TV
</b>              I have nothing against Mr.
              Blomkvist. He's a good journalist
              who I don't believe is guided by
              malice. But what he wrote was
              inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go
              unanswered. He - all journalists -
              have to accept like the rest of us,
              actions have consequences.

    Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter.

    He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette.
    Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the
    lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
    Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.

<b>                            TV NEWSCASTER V/O

              thousand SKE in damages and all court
              costs, which could be significantly
              more.

    He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful
    feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it,
    finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.

          I agree, is that everyone has a right
          to a certain amount of privacy, even
          when they're being investigated.

          if there's anything about him I might
          find unsavory - even if she doesn't.

Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and
encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no
more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -

</b>          He's had a long sexual relationship
          with his co-editor. It wrecked his
          marriage, but not hers. Her husband
          accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at
          Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.

Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much
simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.

      Blomkivist disembarks to find Frode - who he can only
      assume is Frode - beyond a veil of snow, waving to him
      from outside a Mercedes. Unlike Blomkvist, he's dressed
      for this God-awful weather in a fur-collared topcoat.

      to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a
      distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man
      who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any
      attention; just someone hunting.

      Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else,
      including the young man from the bridge, his jacket

     The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here
     he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The
     taxi drives off and disappears into the snow.

     a small printer.

     He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no
     reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces
     it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands
     a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads
     straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him.

     can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the
     end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.

     He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from
     before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in

     forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with
     him, then the room, and groans. He pads to the door in
     the freezing cold. Opens it to find a rugged older man
     on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.

     Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around
     the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold
     grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old
     man, is inadequately dressed.

<b>                             VANGER
</b>               The island is owned by my family.
               Your closest neighbor is my brother
               Harald, another Nazi if you can
               believe. Two in the family. He's
               detestable to put it nicely, but
               you'll probably never see him. He's
               a recluse.

</b>               Indeed he was.

     Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a
     suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -
<b>                             VANGER
</b>               That's his daughter Cecilia's house.

               Harald.

          so. Soon you'll know us all only too
          well - with my apologies.

          Out there is my nephew Martin's
          house; Harriet's brother.

It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point.

</b>          I speak to him. He runs the company
          now, as I think I told you.

They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.     It startles
Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.

</b>          I just met him.
<b>                        VANGER
</b>          He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.

Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a
suspect. Vanger points off -
<b>                        VANGER
</b>          He lives over there.

Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          And you live here.

For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means.
Then he is, and is pleased by it.

      As the search continues, Morell, looking like he hasn't
      slept - which he hasn't - peers down a rocky cliff to the

          Was   it spontaneous? Was it planned?
          Did   she know something someone wished
          she   didn't? Was it about business?

<b>                        MORELL
</b>          And very bright. Henrik told me he
          could easily imagine her running the
          business someday, which would mean
          someone else wouldn't.


<b>                        BLOMKVIST

          At a parade. You must have talked to
          them.

<b>                        MORELL
</b>          She told them she wasn't feeling
          well. She left early. But they also
          said she kept secrets from them, too.
          The main thing I learned talking to
          them for hours is that teenage girls
          are complicated.
<b>                         BLOMKVIST

               (Blomkvist does indeed)
          Did you bring the last gift Henrik
          received?

<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          It's at the National Forensic Lab.

He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket.
Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it
delicately. The decades have dried out its pages.

</b>          She received this from Henrik the
          Christmas before. I studied it more
          times than I can say. I know every

</b>          The only names not alphabetized.
Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns
to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting:
Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018

<b>                        MORELL
</b>          They're local Hedestad phone numbers.
          The first belonged to a woman named
          Margot, whose mother was Magda, who
          claimed she didn't know Harriet. The
          fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie
          Larsson, an elderly woman who died a
          few years before. The other three
          were unconnected in any way that I
          could find.
He hands the address book back. It, and everything else
about the case, clearly trouble him still.

</b>          I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka

Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.

<b>                        MORELL
</b>          Every policeman has at least one
          unsolved case. Back then it was old
          Torstensson. Year after year he kept
          returning to one - taking out the
          files - uselessly studying them. As
          young men, we had to laugh.

<b>                             MORELL
</b>               No, that's not why I mention it.
               The Rebecka Case is something that
               happened before Harriet was born.
               I'm talking about the soul of a
               policeman. Poor Torstensson could
               never solve it, and could never let
               it go.
     And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case.

     reviews him: About 50; spends    money on suits, thinking

Salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all

          use, and most recently for assault:
          a bottle smashed into a man's face.
          You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into

</b>          We can talk about it now.
               (Blomkvist glances to Liv)
          Liv knows everything about my crazy
          family. Which is why she'll never
          marry me.

<b>                        LIV
</b>          That's one reason.

She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it.
The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not
unlike Blomkvist and Erika.
<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          Don't put that in your book.
          Anything else is fine. Harriet
          certainly. Everything changed after
          that. Not just the family, but the
          company.

<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          How so.

<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but
          we're still the largest family-owned
          company in the country. At the
          height, we had 40,000 employees. We
          have about half that now, and that
          downward slide - anyone can tell you -
          began after my sister's death. It
          broke Henrik's entrepreneurial
          spirit, and his heart.

And Martin's, too, clearly.    Blomkvist dares to ask, as
innocently as possible -

               - were even worse.

     As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a
     subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of
     her messenger bag from her shoulder -
     She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the
     junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down,
     but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the
     escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto
     the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now.

     She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the
     junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He
     wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator
     and disappears into the underground station.

</b>                I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
                He's a titan - and a gentleman. But
                he's also quite old now - which may
                explain how he could be taken in by
                a convicted liar.

      The report segues to another story.     The clerk hands
      Salander her receipt.

      Her hardware store purchases, along with some fresh DVD-
      R's, a couple of plastic bottles of ink, and McDonald's
      Kids Meal wrappers, sit by her laptop.

      She's not typing on its keyboard, but characters are
      appearing nonetheless as someone somewhere else, writes
      an email:
      The From box reads:   h wennerstrom <HEW@WG.com>

</b>      Blomkvist has returned to the accident photos. Pauses
      on a blurry one of the fire crew, the focus inadvertently
      on the background - Vanger's manor.

      What caught his attention is a figure in one of the
      upstairs windows. He checks a scribbled floor plan of
      the manor and sees that it's Harriet's bedroom.

      But he's not sure if it's Harriet. The figure is too
      soft to identify - even with a magnifying glass - but is
      wearing a light-colored dress and has light hair.
      He glances to the family tree on the wall - the teenage
      Vanger girls' photos -

      Three INSERTS:   Harriet ... Cecelia ... Anita ...

      They all have light hair, and, frankly, all look alike.

      He moves on to the parade pictures. To the one Vanger
      said before was the last picture taken of Harriet alive.
      It's not really of her.

</b>      

      It's a wide shot of the parade itself - but she can be
      seen in the background across the street with her
      friends, watching a float - atop which some women in
      harem outfits dance - pass by.
      He slips it from its corner-fasteners and turns it over.
      There's a Hedestad Courier copyright printed on the back.
      He turns it over again and looks at the photo itself.

      Guided by the photo, he walks along the town's main
      street to the approximate place from which it was taken -
      outside a haberdashery window - but it's still not right.
      The photo was shot from a higher than street level angle.
      He looks to a second story window above the store. Then
      crosses the street to where Harriet was standing when the
      picture was taken. Looks back at the haberdashery where,
      now, the owner peers out at him.

       She pulls four thick binders off a shelf from September
       1966 alone, proving Blomkvist's point about photographers
       - and piles them up next to a light-box and scanner.

       The door opens revealing Salander. Bjurman seems a
       little surprised to see her at his doorstep.

      She looks like a schoolgirl with her little backpack over
      her shoulder. How did he ever get so lucky?

      She steps inside. He takes her hand and leads her
      toward the bedroom. Her other hand slips into her jacket
      pocket.

<b>                              BJURMAN

      She pulls a Taser from her pocket and jams it under his
      chin, firing off 75,000 volts -
<b>122   EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                      122

      Set down on the rugged landscape under an almost moonless
      night sky, the cottage looks vulnerable.

<b>123   INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                      123
</b>      The cat, curled up on a chair, jerks its head up at a
      sound neither we nor Blomkvist can hear, and stays
      absolutely still, listening.

      Blomkvist scrolls through the Courier negatives he has
      converted into positives and has loaded into Photoshop.
      He was right. Many more parade pictures were shot that
      day. Several at street level - a marching band, floats,
      children with balloons, some in better focus than others.
      He reaches the first of the higher-angle shots from the
      floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the
      street. Harriet isn't in it.

      But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame
      with her school friends. In the next, she's further into
      frame. And the next, standing in the same spot he stood
      earlier today.

      Blomkvist selects all 18 of the high-angle parade
      photographs, transfers them to an iPhoto file, and
      reopens them as a `slide show.'
      The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet
      in G, dissolve at two-second intervals. Too long. Too
      distracting with the music. And too wide.
      He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets
      rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time-
      interval to make the transitions as quick as possible.

      He hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent
      film'- a kind of electronic flip-book:

      Harriet arrives with her friends. Moves along the
      street. Stops and faces the parade. Says something to
      her friends. Laughs. Watches the float with the harem
      girls on it. Smiles. Sees something to her left. Turns
      her head slightly toward it. Her eyes widen in fear.
      She looks down. She moves off. Her friends look after
      her confused. And then she's gone.
      Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off
      with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes
      without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years:

      She was murdered. Whoever she saw across the street
      followed her and killed her. The cat watches him.

      It takes him a moment to realize it's true. Another to
      realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked
      on the floor, face-up, wrists and ankles bound. He tries
      to cry out and realizes he's also gagged.

      She emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he
      sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some
      kind of ghoulish raccoon. She looks insane. As she
      steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle
      against the restraints.

      resting on a chair.

          It's a wide-angle micro-lens.

She takes a DVD-R from the backpack, puts it in his
player, flips his plasma TV on with a remote. She got it
all - what he did to her - the rape - in HD.

weeps into the gag.

He won't. She strides to her backpack. Takes out a
large dildo. Gets on her knees, and works it into his
ass. She can only get it about halfway up. She has to
stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot.
He howls into the gag.

She does indeed. He vigorously nods his head, now, and

       begins dragging it back and forth. He screams as dots

       The job has taken her all night. The sky outside the
       living room window is beginning to lighten. She drinks a
       glass of water in the kitchen, wipes her prints from it.

       She crosses to the bedroom where Bjurman's toys have
       been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser. Picks up
       her backpack. Looks at him. He's unconscious. She sets
       handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach.

       We stay on the key as she leaves the room. Hearing the
       front door open and close, we rise up to see his entire
       naked body on the bed. Tattooed into his skin in big
       letters, from his nipples to his groin, is:

       Returning from a walk and a smoke, Blomkvist sees -
       sitting outside the cottage, petting his cat - Harriet.
       Of course it can't be her, but it is a teenage girl who
       resembles the old pictures of her. Seeing him, she
       waves. It's his daughter.

       As they eat in silence, Blomkvist can't help but think
       about Harriet and what Vanger said about not giving her
       his attention when she needed it.

      What was she talking about? He glances absently to the

<b>130   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAY                              130
</b>      Blomkvist comes in, goes straight to his desk, sifts
      through the paperwork on it, then sees the Xerox of the
      last page of Harriet's address book - the unknown phone
      numbers - he taped to the lamp -

      Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018
      It could be a coincidence they're Bible names -
      Magdalene, Sarah, Mary - or maybe not. He digs through
      Harriet's personal things for her Bible.
      Since all the number sequences begin with `3,' he goes
      to the third chapter - Leviticus - notices that its first
      facing page is faintly dog-eared - finds R.J's verse -
      1:14 - on it:

<b>                              HARRIET V/O
</b>                If a dove is the sinner's offering,
                the priest shall wring off its head,

                the altar.

      Pinching a cigarette in a shaking hand, Blomkvist pokes
      numbers on his cell phone. Instead of ringing he hears a
      beep. "Retry?" appears on the cell screen.

      Back across the bridge by the gas station, he makes the
      call on the pay phone.

      He reaches the manor just as the ambulance is leaving
      and Martin is climbing into his Range Rover. He looks
      undone.

      quotes from Harriet's list in her dog-eared Bible -

      There's a knock. He tucks the list in the Bible, sets
      aside and answers the door. Frode comes in.
<b>                              FRODE

He points to the table.

<b>                          BLOMKVIST
</b>           A sandwich?
<b>                          FRODE

Blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself.

<b>                         BLOMKVIST
</b>           I don't want to be indelicate. But

Silence.   Blomkvist drinks.   Eventually -

<b>                         BLOMKVIST
</b>           We also never discussed who I'd

<b>                         BLOMKVIST

Frode looks at Blomkvist a little more intently.
<b>                         FRODE
</b>           What do you mean?

          You're joking.
               (Blomkvist isn't)
          What did you find?
Now it's Blomkvist who studies Frode. He's not sure he
wants to tell him. And even less so the longer he looks.

<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          The last time I reported something
          before I was sure of it, it cost me
          my savings.

Frode studies him again - wondering perhaps if Blomkvist
suspects him.
<b>                        BLOMKVIST

Blomkvist's brain tries to quickly inventory his life,
pausing at its darker recesses. Frode nods.

<b>                        FRODE
</b>          Yes, it was quite thorough.

       Blomkvist comes in to find - like Morell did 40 years
       ago - a strange tableaux of suspects - two of whom he's
       only yet seen in photographs on his cottage wall -
       Birger, Cecilia, Frode, Martin, Gunnar, Anna, and,
       looking like an aging overdressed vampire, Isabella,

       Blomkvist comes in as Martin drives off. Salander is
       already unpacking her things - laptop, charger, change of
       clothes. What's she doing, moving in?

She doesn't say. He comes over. She plays the iMovie,
stops on a frame before Harriet turns her head. Points
to a young couple standing among the people behind her.
The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand.
<b>                        SALANDER

She advances to the next frame:    The woman has raised
the camera to her eye.

And the next: Harriet turning her head in foreground
while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's
Instamatic flares slightly.

Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice
it before, and what it means: Though the woman is taking
a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently
included in it whatever - whoever - Harriet saw at that
moment across the street.
<b>                        BLOMKVIST

He takes over his laptop from her, finds the later
Courier photos he didn't include in his iMovie, after
Harriet has left.

In one, the couple is moving off the other way. In
another, they're getting in a parked car to leave.
He sharpens the Photoshop contrast. The rear license
plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make
out even by squinting.

       He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch -
       The charred corpse of the cat. Its legs - sawn off and
       arranged in the shape of a swastika - lie in the middle
       of a dark circle of blood.

       He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees
       it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing
       close-ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop
       the seat of her motorcycle.

      Having returned and scanned Mildred's snapshot into

      Blomkvist regards Isabella's two photos on the wall.
      In one she's a stunning young woman.    In the other, the
      old wreck she's become.
      He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo. Where a
      second more current photo of him should go is a Courier
      article about his drowning in 1965. That's when Isabella
      changed - and this is where it happened - in this old
      house out on the point.

      He untacks the article -

      Blomkvist has   to walk on to reach it. He glances inside -

      looks back to   the shore at the long-uninhabited cabin.

      No electricity but enough light spills through the open
      door for him to see the neglected, shadowy interior:

      Beds with bare, or no, mattresses. Sticks of furniture.
      Old water-stained books strewn around. Beer bottles and
      other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers.
      It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing
      what you know.

      He kneels to look at some of the books. Mickey Spillane,
      a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about
      the USSR, a children's book. He opens this last one and
      sees "Harriet" scrawled in a very young child's hand.

      Having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds
      himself at the highest point on the island. Stops to
      rest at the ruins of a fort.

      A piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly
      erupts. As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the
      delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot -

      He throws himself to the ground. Crawls desperately
      around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody
      but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and
      finds the blood is coming from his forehead.
      He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he
      could it would mean they were walking toward him, which
      would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank.
      He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind
      him - the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him - a
      clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice -

      He runs for the trees. Dives through a curtain of
      thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and
      hands. Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his
      elbows and toes like an infantryman.

      Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he
      looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait.

      Salander, returned from Stockholm, moves around the
      cottage - inside and out - installing the equipment she
      brought from Milton Security:
      Motion detectors - security cameras - software that
      bisects a PC screen into quadrants showing night-vision
      views of each corner of the cottage.

      A figure appears on a quadrant of Salander's surveillance
      PC. Comes past the motorcycle and nearly reaches the

      She opens the door to see him covered in blood, pressing
      a torn piece of his shirt to his bleeding head - and
      almost gasps.

                 It's still bleeding ... why is it
                 still bleeding ...

       She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits - still
       in his pants - half-submerged in tepid water - bottle of
       vodka in his hand.

<b>                               BLOMKVIST

       She splashes some of the vodka on the needle. Most of it
       goes in the water. Hands the bottle back to him.

<b>                               SALANDER
</b>                 Drink some more.
       He takes a swig from the vodka bottle. She reaches to his
       face with the needle and floss -

<b>                               BLOMKVIST
</b>                 Careful, it's my eye.

<b>                                SALANDER

       It takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't
       enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh.
       He pulls away with a groan.

       She just looks at him. Waits for him to take another swig
       of vodka to steel himself.
       She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through
       the skin. And after that it doesn't seem to be so bad.
       As she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of
       dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work.
       Hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down.

       She regards the surveillance monitor, the night-vision
       views of the cottage. She can't believe it but she feels
       vigilant more for his sake than her own.

       She goes to a window and looks out. Sees her own
       reflection in the glass and studies it. Then kicks her

       She pulls her t-shirt over his stitched-up head,

       Afterwards. She opens his dwindling pack of cigarettes.
       Lights one. Glances over to him lying next to her. He's
       not looking at the smoke but rather the startling tattoos

       Cecilia looks at the blurred bridge photo of Harald with
       the camera in his hand. Then at Blomkvist, coolly.

       He gives her his most disarming smile. It usually works
       with women, but doesn't seem to have much affect on her.

      Salander gets up and crosses to an anteroom where an
      unhappy older woman - the archive manager - seems to be
      doing nothing but waiting for the strange girl to leave.

      the phone.

      Stairs lead them to a higher floor. The woman climbs a
      step-stool. Pulls a couple of large binders from a high
      shelf. Salander doesn't help her off the stool and the
      woman looks at her even more unhappily than before.

      The blinds, as usual, closed. Couple of lamps throw
      shadows on the walls which display hunting and military
      trophies - wild game heads, sabers and vintage firearms -
      some of Harald's dearer photographs - some photographs in
      dusty frames.

      Blomkvist, alone in the room, looks at them:     Swedish
      Nazi leader in the 1930's.

      The 92-year-old comes into the room from the kitchen,
      followed by a housekeeper with a tea tray. Indicates the
      younger man in the photo, also in a Nazi uniform, that
      Blomkvist is looking at.

      Blomkvist nods. Has no idea what to say.     But Harald
      waits for more of a response. Finally -

      rifle displayed on a shelf ...

</b>
      A bony Nazi pouring tea in a shadowy room with you is
      bad, but the rabbit-print tea cozy only makes it worse.
      Blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn
      leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an
      old shoebox of unsorted photographs:

      A holiday at Lake Como, early 1950's judging from the
      cars; a Vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing
      by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope.

      Harald holds out a pack of cigarettes.     Blomkvist comes
      over, pulls one out.

<b>                              HARALD
</b>                Blom ... kvist ...
                     (lights the cigarette)
                With an `o' - or a `u.'

<b>                                BLOMKVIST

<b>                               HARALD
</b>                An `o.'   Blom - kvist.

      Harald doesn't say it, but his nod means, `not Jewish
      then. Good' Blomkvist returns to the photos, glancing
      up occasionally to the smoke curling up past Harald's
      face as he examines the journalist at work.

<b>                              HARALD

                my door to anyone. They just don't

                I'm the most honest of all of them.

      Blomkvist opens another shoebox. Lying on top is a
      photograph of the bridge accident, and, under it, a few
      more. He takes them out and angles them toward a lamp.
<b>                                                              114.

</b>                The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad.
                Excellent lens.

      Blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively, but the bridge
      photos don't tell him anything he doesn't already know.

      He finds several more that appear to be a hunting
      expedition - men and blood hounds - but then sees Morell
      in one, more policemen, and a stricken Henrik in boots
      and raincoat, and realizes this is the search party. Off
      to the side, a young man, head turned half away, wearing
      a dark blazer with a gold patch, which that 2.8 Zeiss
      lens makes clear is a prep school insignia. A lion.
<b>                               HARALD

</b>                No, it's - I can't tell who it is
                from this angle.

      He takes the photo over to the Nazi who only has to
      glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephew's son:

<b>                              HARALD
</b>                That's Gottfried's boy.

<b>                              BLOMKVIST
</b>                Martin?
      Harald nods, hands it back, smokes. It's not unusual
      Martin would have joined the search party - it would be
      unusual if he hadn't - it's his sister that's missing -
      but this blazer he's wearing troubles Blomkvist -

      Having found nothing of interest in the 1954 files,
      Salander moves on to the 1957 killing of Rakel Lunde.
      The older woman comes back. Drops a set of keys on the

      reads a yellowed clipping from a Landskrona newspaper:

      It's about Vanger Industries hiring a local contractor,
      Carlen Construction, to build a plant. Gottfried Vanger -
      here to sign the contract.

      But all that really interests Salander is the date. The
      article was published one day after the paper printed the
      story of the discovery of Rakel's battered naked body.

      Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made
      during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona -
      and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was
      as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction.



      The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from
      Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative
      in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger.
      Gottfried Vanger ... which one was he again? Salander
      brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall
      of the cottage: the Vanger family tree.

      Gottfried Vanger, Son of Margareta & Richard the Nazi
      Husband of crazy Isabella, Father of Martin and Harriet

      Of all the Vangers - at least back in 1950 when Harriet
      was born - Gottfried was the most handsome. Clark Gable
      good looks.
      She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari
      Holmberg and the 1954 Vanger files.

      `Gottfried's useless boy' with the search party. In it
      and the parade photo, he's wearing the same blazer.

      He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's
      victims' files. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson,
      1967. The photo is a school wallet photo - in a sweater
      with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin.

      Knowing what she's looking for now, Salander finds it
      fairly quickly: A clipping about a timber company Vanger
      Industries bought in Kalmar and an interview in its local
      paper with Gottfried, two days after Mari's murder.

      She jumps to 1960 - Magda Lovisa Sjoberg - Karlstad - and
      an article in its local paper - this time with a photo of
      Gottfried - about a union dispute at its factory there.

      Blomkvist comes out with his cell phone, tries to make a
      bar or two materialize on it. Dials but only gets a beep
      that asks him if he wants to `retry.' He doesn't.

      Instead, under the darkening sky, he looks off to the
      point. Martin's house is small in the distance, but he
      can see there's no car in the driveway and no lights on.
      He stares at it for a long time ...

      Salander pulls a 1962 Uddevalla paper from the files.
      Same day this time, the same page of the newspaper: Lea
      Persson's horrific murder and an story quoting Gottfried
      about an expansion project to the town's harbor.
      She regards Gottfried's newsprint photo: His face looks
      more than 8 years older than the one in Kalmar but that's
      what drinking to excess, and murder perhaps, does to you.

      Blomkvist lays the Lena Andersson article - and the
      photograph of the figure at the parade - atop the rest of
      the junk on the desk - and quickly scrolls through photos
      on his laptop, leaving on the screen for Salander to see
      when she returns: Martin's recent Vanger Industries PR
      portrait ...

      Salander has hit a snag. Gets up. We stay to have a
      look at the problem she leaves: the victims list - now
      with "Gottfried" jotted down next to all but one name:
      1967 - Lena Andersson - Uppsala

      Next to it, the newspaper article about the murdered
      girl, with a school photo. And, next to that, the reason
      there's no "Gottfried" notation: his obituary in a
      Hedestad Courier clipping: 1965.
      We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps -

      As annoying as the older woman was, it was less creepy
      with her around. Salander is alone in the old building
      now, wandering through it looking for vending machines.

      She finds some. Drops coins in one. A cup fills with
      coffee. She gets a candy bar from another. The coffee
      machine finishes. The place again plunges into silence.
      She starts back with her snack down a hallway -

      Trying to look like he's just out for a stroll,
      Blomkvist walks past Martin's dark house, then turns
      around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a
      show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the
      island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness.
      He tries the door. Locked. Comes down off the porch as
      if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around
      to the side of the house.

      He peers through a floor-to-ceiling window, but can't
      see much inside. Comes around to the back and looks in
      another window. Tries the back door. Unlocked.

      He can't see a lot in the dark, but doesn't dare switch
      on any lights. He crosses through the kitchen, but we
      stay behind to regard a closed basement door ...

      We pick him up again as he comes into the living room,
      follow him to a wall of glass. It's pitch black outside.

      We follow him down a hallway - but stop at a bedroom
      doorway as if this is as far as we care to go. We stay
      at the threshold and watch him go in and look around. As
      he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet -

       Blomkvist comes into a study. Lots of books and framed
       photographs. He begins looking around.

       Blomkvist approaches a gun case in the study. Hunting
       rifles. Three of them - and an empty space for a fourth
       one.

       The trees outside the study window flare with light. A
       moment later, Blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel.
       Martin is back, and Blomkvist is in his house.

       We rush back down the hall with Blomkvist. Hopefully
       Martin will enter through the front door because we're
       going to try to get out the back one -

       Blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down
       with him. Then up again - through the kitchen - past the
       basement door - grabs a knife from a drawer - shoves it
       in a back pocket - hurries out the rear door -

       around the side of the house. As he passes a window, it
       lights up - and we again hit the ground with him.
       He hurries across the yard, trips over something in the
       dark - a sprinkler? - and goes down again into wet muck.

       He gets up and starts down the road as if returning from
       a leisurely evening walk - which would be more convincing
       without the limp - not daring to look back as he goes.

      Naturally, this is the last thing Blomkvist wants to do,
      but it would be more suspicious if he refuses. He heads
      back to Martin's house, trying not to limp.

      Finished with her candy bar and coffee, Salander opens
      the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything
      of note in Uppsala, where Lena was killed.

      She finds no news of factories opening there that year,
      but she does come across a PR newsletter about a winter
      retreat for fifty employees and their families.

      There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best
      Worker of the Year plaque. And another taken at a dinner
      for twenty guests and Vanger family members:
      The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of
      the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne
      flute - as everyone else does the same - except for the
      young man at the far right foreground.

      He looks sullen. But what teenager wouldn't at an event
      as boring as this. Salander would look even more sullen.
      She checks the caption and reads:

      ... far right, Martin Vanger (19), currently studying in
      Uppsala.

      Uppsala. Same place as Lena - though it's what young
      Martin is wearing that strikes her: an Uppsala private
      school blazer with a lion on its pocket - the same as on
      Lena Andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the
      article about her murder.

      It's not as eerie with the lights on - except for the
      fact there's a killer in it. Martin sets the golf clubs
      down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen.

      Martin smiles, but Blomkvist isn't sure what he said
      warrants one. Martin begins rummaging through a drawer
      for a flashlight. The knife block - with one missing -
      is right there.

      not seeming to notice, finds a mini-Maglite in the
      drawer.

      Martin "leads" Blomkvist from behind back to the kitchen,
      switching off lights as they go.

<b>                              MARTIN
</b>                You know what's harder than
                shooting someone? Just missing
                them. That was a very good shot
                up at the cabin.

<b>                              BLOMKVIST
</b>                It didn't work. I'm here.

<b>                              MARTIN
</b>                Mikael, it did work.     You're here.
      They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a
      door.

<b>                                MARTIN
</b>                Open it.
      Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As
      they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent
      tubes flicker on to reveal: A furnace. Washer. Dryer.
      Old discarded furniture. And another door. A steel one.
      As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and
      the lock on the steel door clicks.
<b>                                MARTIN
</b>                Push it open.

      As Blomkvist steps across the threshold -

<b>                               MARTIN
</b>                 Switch is on the left.

       Blomkvist flips it and a row of overhead fluorescent
       tubes flickers on - one after the other - revealing a
       subterranean torture chamber:

       Metal eyelets bolted to the concrete walls and ceiling
       and floor - table with leather straps - bed with leather
       straps - steel-mesh cage - work bench with handsaws and
       other tools -

       Blomkvist takes it in with one glance and immediately
       turns to try to smash the glass in his hand into Martin's
       face - which is covered now with a plastic oxygen mask he
       holds to it. Gas plumes down on Blomkvist from above;
       the glass comes out of his hand, shattering on the cement
       floor -

       across the bridge onto the island.

</b>
       Blomkvist comes to on the floor, handcuffed to a chain
       that runs through a metal eyelet. He sees Martin behind
       a video camera on a tripod, focusing it - a shelf full of
       Betamax tapes - and a TV monitor on which his own image
       then appears.
       Note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to
       notice - which we aren't - is not locked. It's not even
       completely shut.

       Satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest,
       Martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered
       in clear plastic. It squeaks.

       He regards Blomkvist calmly.   Sips his drink.    Then
       almost sighs.

<b>                               MARTIN
</b>                 Why didn't you just go home.

</b>                 I assume you mean the opportunity
                 for that has passed.

       Martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, Blomkvist's "easy"
       manner in this dire circumstance.

<b>                               MARTIN

Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin looks like he has all the
time in the world to wait, and does. Then -

<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          We can talk or we can just get on
          with it. It's really up to you.

Nothing from Blomkvist. Martin shrugs `okay,' gets up,
goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain
from it. As he's laying it on the floor around his
victim, Blomkvist changes his mind -

<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          I found a picture no one had seen
          before.
<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          Of.
<b>                       BLOMKVIST
</b>          You. In your Uppsala prep school
          blazer.

Martin doesn't see the significance, but is pleased
Blomkvist has decided to "participate." He rewards him by
suspending his shower curtain work to return to the
chair. It squeaks again.
<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          What does that say?

<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          That you lied about where you were
          that day. Or rather when.

<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          Did I? If I did, so what.    People
          lie all the time.

<b>                        BLOMKVIST
</b>          It also said that Lena Andersson was
          a schoolmate.
<b>                        MARTIN

               (he has to think back to
                remember her)
          Lena was a long time ago.

       Blomkvist isn't sure how to play that question ...

</b>                 Let's hope it's as much as you.

<b>                               MARTIN
</b>                 And that's a lie. She's sitting in
                 our offices looking at more old crap.
                 Our archives manager called me - very
                 perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth.
                 I like that name. Lisbeth. When
                 Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from
                 security, so I can be at your cottage
                 to greet her when she arrives -
       He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when
       he was out cold.

       out the surveillance PC. Puts it on the desk - next to
       Blomkvist's laptop which is now displaying - not the
       photo of Martin he left for her - but the Apple default
       "light spider" screen saver.

       As Salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance
       images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the
       day -

       himself in the shot, sits again and crosses his leg like

<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          So what would you like to know?
There are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist
says nothing.

<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          You're the journalist, ask me
          something.

Nothing from Blomkvist.   Which is okay with Martin; he
can do this alone -
<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          What do I do with my guests? Is that
          the question? Well, before - I do
          what we're doing. Relax, have a
          drink, converse. I like that part a
          lot - having a chat when you both
          know one of you is going to die.
          After - I simply get rid of them.
          Out to sea -
               (points off)
           - unlike my father leaving them
          scattered all over the place like
          trophies. That's not smart if you
          ask me. That's just garish and loud.
          But he was a garish and loud man.
          Frankly, he got what he deserved.
Nothing from Blomkvist, but he is wondering now what
happened to Gottfried if the drowning wasn't accidental.

<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          You can't be a sloppy technician like
          that.   You can't drink to excess
          like he did. This takes discipline.
          It's a science of a thousand details.
          The planning. The execution. The
          cleanup. I'm sure I don't have to
          tell you you're going to make quite a
          mess.

Nothing from Blomkvist, but Martin nods.
("How do you do this and still function in normal
society?")

<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          That's the interesting thing.
          Because most of the time I am just
          like everyone else. I just have a
          bigger secret. It's wonderful really
          - standing there waiting for a train -
          or on a street corner as people brush

</b>          you have secrets. You had one when
          you came up here. It made you feel -
          special. Didn't it?

Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin is a little thrown by
Blomkvist's next unspoken comment -

("Yes, but my secrets aren't rape and murder")
<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          No. I'm not a rapist. Of course I
          do that too - and at one time it was
          enough - but -
               (gathers his thoughts to
                explain it)
          A rapist, Mikael, gets off on
          domination. I need ...
               (discards a few other words
                before:)
          - destruction.

Martin gets up and sets about the business of
immobilizing Blomkvist further with a block-and-tackle
contraption of chains and straps.

<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          Can I ask you something? Why don't
          people trust their instincts? They
          sense something's wrong - someone's
          walking too close behind them - yet
          they don't cross the street. You
          knew something was wrong - you even
          knew what it was - but you came back
          into the house. Did I force you?
          Did I grab you and drag you in? I
          just offered you a drink.
               (pause)
          You'd never think the fear of
          offending could be stronger than the
          fear of pain - but you know what? It
          is. They always come willingly.

It amazes him.   It always amazes him.   He keeps working.
<b>                        MARTIN
</b>          And then they're here. They know
          it's over like you do - and still
          somehow think they have a chance.
          "Maybe if I say the right thing - if
          I'm polite - or I cry and beg - maybe
          I'll survive."

                editorial?

      Blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet
      Martin considers what the journalist hasn't said ...

      ("Martin, civilized people don't do what you do.")

                we're not completely different. We
                both have desires. Satisfying mine
                just requires more towels.

                Irina was down here in the cage.
                Who's Irina, you ask? A girl I met
                in Belarus. Just another girl.
                Another immigrant whore. Who misses
                them?

      He returns to his work bench to lay out various tools
      next to his gun and a desk phone.
<b>                              BLOMKVIST
</b>                Your sister wasn't just another girl.
      Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches
      the noose tighter around Blomkvist's neck as it lifts him
      onto his tiptoes.

<b>                              MARTIN
</b>                What happened to her.

<b>                              BLOMKVIST
</b>                You're choking me -

<b>                              BLOMKVIST
</b>                You killed her.

      Martin just stares at him confused.   Then -

<b>                              MARTIN
</b>                You useless fuckin detective.

</b> 

He lets go of the strap and Blomkvist's feet come back
down to the floor. As Martin returns to his workbench,
Blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now.
Did Martin not kill her?

Then Martin is back in front of him with a roll of
cellophane, pulls on the strap again until Blomkvist is
balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off.

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>           Too tight to talk?
It is.   Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag.

<b>                          MARTIN
</b>           Good.   I'm tired of talking to you.

He wraps Blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely
cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches
him struggle. ...
<b>                         MARTIN
</b>           Would you like me to do something
           about that?

Blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate.
Martin watches another several moments ... then pokes a
finger through the cellophane into Blomkvist's gasping
mouth.
<b>                           MARTIN
</b>           See?    I'm not a monster.
He frames a wide shot of his naked prey. Turns on some
music. Takes a moment to collect himself from all this
strenuous work. Brushes back his hair like he wants to
look presentable in the shot. Then smiles pleasantly -
<b>                         MARTIN
</b>           You know, I've never had a man in
           here. I've never touched a man as a
           matter of fact. Except my father, of
           course. But that was my duty.
           Harriet's, too.

The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by
the strap. His fingers behind his naked back claw at the
concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the
noose, but can't get a grip. Martin watches the struggle
calmly, and just as calmly offers:

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>           It's time. I don't want to be late
           for my date with our girlfriend.

He puts on a plastic rain poncho. A painter's mask.
Plastic goggles. Surgeons gloves. Picks up a hunting
knife. Steps up to Blomkvist. Looks at his eyes.
Brings his own head close to his victim's -
<b>                         MARTIN
</b>           Goodbye, Mikael.
He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the
floor, closing off his air again ... and is about to gut
him like a wild boar ... when he hears a sound like some
kind of animal behind him ...

He turns and sees her - coming at him from out of the
shadows by the steel door -
He darts for the gun he left on the workbench -
Salander just as quickly swings a 5-iron - his 5-iron -
like a baseball bat. Its metal-wedged end arcs through
the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending
him tumbling to the floor.

He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club
again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples
the floor.
She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her
other back pocket. Grabs the hunting knife and shackles
key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part
of the spectacle before losing consciousness -

She saws through the leather strap around his neck.
Unlocks the chain. As he sinks to his knees on the
floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to
life just enough to see what she can't behind her -

Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head,
getting to his feet. But he's not coming at them; he's
trying to get out -

Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look.
Lifts a hand to try to point. She turns and glimpses the
monster as he disappears out the steel door. Looks back
at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a
child asking a parent for permission -

<b>                         SALANDER
</b>           May I kill him?

Nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a
thing - until now. Now it's as if her years of violence
and degradation have been passed to him.

He nods.

</b>    

      She puts the hunting knife in his hand. Pulls the gun
      from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the
      safety, and turns to leave -

<b>                              BLOMKVIST

      She comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun.
      Distant thunder rumbles. She crosses through the kitchen
      to the living room, and down the hall to the study. She
      eases around the doorway - the room is empty - looks to
      the gun case - sees there are only two rifles there now.
      She hears an engine start outside. Hurries back through
      the house. Sees out the picture window the taillights of
      Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst.

      She bangs out the front door. Runs halfway down the
      hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps
      on and kick-starts it.

<b>232   EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT                                 232
</b>
      She roars onto the bridge, chasing the taillights.
      Guns the bike to full throttle. Comes alongside him.
      He swerves to try to crush her against the railing -
      but she hits the brakes, avoiding the impact -

      She accelerates again and comes up on the other side
      of the car. He swerves again at her, but this time the
      bike pulls ahead of him. Now he's chasing her -

      He gains on her as they near the end of the bridge. As
      they race off it, he goes in for the kill, but she veers
      hard to one side, leaving him headed straight for the gas
      station Blomkvist makes his pay phone calls from - and
      the tanker truck parked there -

      Martin hits the brakes - hydroplanes into the truck - and
      its, or his own tank, or both, explode -
      Salander circles back. Regards the fire engulfing the
      car. The rain does nothing to dampen it. She could
      probably brave it to pull Martin out - but doesn't.
      As the flames burn his clothes, he manages to get his
      hands on the rifle he took from the den, turns its barrel
      to his bloody head - but before he can pull the trigger,
      she hurries over, yanks it from his grasp and stands back
      again. It's much more cathartic to watch him burn ...

      She finds Blomkvist in the living room. Sitting in a
      chair, his coat wrapped around him. The hunting knife in

      barely manage to speak -

      Frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder Salander
      brought from Martin's chamber of horrors late last night:

      A scrapbook of murder. A death book. Photos of women
      cowering in his cage, tied to the bed, dead on the table -
      along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of
      hair - all carefully taped into the `album.' The older
      photographs are Polaroids; the newer ones digital prints.
      With little to no discernible emotion, Salander watches
      Frode wince as he turns the pages.

      Frode can't take it anymore. Closes the book before
      reaching the end. Just sits there.

      She pours milk in her coffee from the carton she just
      bought. Pushes over two faded Polaroid photos. He picks
      them up:
      One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up,

      components he doesn't understand, Blomkvist anxiously
      stares out a tinted window at a dark row house.

      Headlights flare down the street. An approaching car.
      He hopes it passes, but it instead pulls up to the garage
      - waits for the door to go up - pulls in.

      door come down - light go on inside the house - then dark
      figures hurrying along the side of the house: Trinity,
      Salander, and finally Plague. They climb into the van
      with their tools, firewires, a laptop. None speaks as

       taps they installed earlier. One of the laptops, without
       anyone touching it, blinks on to a Google screen.

       Clicking it takes her to an auction for a triple-strand
       faux-pearl Jackie O necklace: 49 pounds. The cursor

                night and started bragging about
                women he'd killed. He quoted from
                the Bible as he tore off my clothes.

      Harriet makes it out of the cabin in torn clothing,
      trying to get the belt around her neck off. Her father
      can heard inside ranting something from the Bible.

      Gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the
      hill in pursuit of his almost-naked daughter.

      As he comes onto the dock, she waits for the moment, and
      smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar. It
      stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water.

      He surfaces, reaches for the dock planks. As he takes
      hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings
      the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head
      like an axe.

      He stares up her, uncomprehending. His fingers slide
      away from the dock. His body goes limp and sinks out of
      sight beneath the water.

                  genuine, but they're the only things
                  that are. The rest is funneled
                  through companies in Gibraltar,
                  Colombia, and Macao. These companies
                  produce no products and provide no
                  services. They're shells. They
                  launder money from arms and drug
                  sales, and crime syndicates in
                  Russia. And that money - which
                  accounts for all but 5-percent of his
                  holdings - ends up in accounts in the
                  Cayman Islands. It's a completely
                  illegal, criminal empire.

</b>          In the current issue of Millennium
          magazine, he now charges the same
          company that successfully sued him -
          The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal
          activities on a global scale -
          backing it up with internal financial
          reports, bank records and emails -
          annotations almost as long as the
          article itself.

The cover of the magazine features a head shot of
Wennerstrom, and, rare for the magazine, a tabloid-style
title: GANGLAND.    Salander leafs through the article as
Blomkvist brushes his teeth in the bathroom.

</b>          He'll call it a personal vendetta
          but it won't work. FI can't ignore
          banking and securities fraud like
          this. The police can't ignore the
          organized crime stuff. They'll both
          have to investigate.

</b>          We'll be back in court, but this
          time it'll cost him. That's probably
          it, though. These guys never to
          prison.

Salander nods, but it's not really in agreement. Or
maybe it is. In any case, she's not as enthused about
all this as he is.

<b>                          BLOMKVIST

      unravels. He puts his wallet away.

      about his personal affairs than he does.

- starts it - and drives off -

Probably forever.
