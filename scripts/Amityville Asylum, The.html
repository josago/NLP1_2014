          We slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on
          the south shore of Long Island. The still shroud of night
          blankets the village of Amityville in the early morning

          Stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and
          neighbours slumber. We reach 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch
          Colonial house. The home is a classic piece of Americana,
          two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on
          the Amityville River. There are quarter round windows on the
          top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at
          us.
                         
          A signpost in the front yard reads "HIGH HOPES", a testament
          to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there.

          We move slowly through the basement, past various crushed
          beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia, until we
          reach a bearded man in his early twenties. RONALD DEFEO
          JUNIOR, known to his family and friends as BUTCH. He sits on
          a ragged sofa, dozing off in front of a small Television
          that displays white static.
                         
          There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the
          sofa. It reads 3:14am. We hold on the clock and the time
          changes to 3:15am. We can see DeFeo's breath drift from his

          lips as cold air sweeps through the room. His eyes snap
          open.
          A hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, steps from the
          shadows. The figure carries a .35 caliber lever action
          Marlin 336C rifle. Hands clad in black leather gloves, the
          mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch. A
          voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be

          into the shadows.

          The house is silent. Butch quietly stalks the hallways, the
          rifle grasped tightly in his hands.

</b>                         
          Butch quietly pushes the door aside and observes his parents
          as they sleep. RONALD DEFEO SENIOR, age forty three, is a
          heavy set Italian American man and his wife LOUISE DEFEO is
          a slender woman, aged forty two, with flowing blonde hair.
          Both are lying flat on their stomachs. Without hesitation,
          Butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the
          trigger. The BLAST is deafening. The first shot rips into
          his fathers back, tearing through his kidney and exiting
          through his chest. Butch fires another round, again hitting
          his father in the back. This shot pierces the base of Ronald
          Senior's spine, and lodges in his neck.Louise DeFeo's eyes
          open, but she barely has a few seconds to react. Butch aims
          the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed, and
          fires two shots in quick succession. The bullets shatter her
          rib cage and collapse her right lung. Both bodies now lay
          silently in fresh pools of their own blood.

          Butch, in an almost trance like state, walks down the hall
          and quietly nudges the door to another bedroom.

          Butch enters the bedroom that his two brothers MARK, aged
          twelve, and JOHN, aged nine, share. He walks between their
          two beds as they lie on their stomachs, sleeping soundly.
          Standing directly above his two helpless brothers, Butch
          fires one shot into each of the boys as they lay sleeping.
                         
          The bullets tear through their young bodies, ravaging their
          internal organs, laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of
          them. Mark lays motionless, while John, whose spinal cord
          has been severed by his brother's heartless attack, twitches
          spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting.

          Stangely, the loud shots have not roused the remaining
          members of the DeFeo family, and Butch skulks unchallenged
          to his final destination-the bedroom shared by his sisters
          DAWN, eighteen years old, and ALLISON, aged thirteen.

          As Butch enters the room, Allison stirs. She looks up just
          as Butch lowers the rifle to her face and pulls the trigger.
          Butch then aims his weapon at Dawn's head and squeezes the
          trigger again, literally blowing the left side of her face
          off. Both girls die instantly. The white sheets and walls
          are splattered with blood and brain matter. Butch is unmoved
          and expressionless. He surveys the carnage for a moment,
          then calmly walks out of the room.

          Butch walks past a photograph hanging on the wall in a red
          frame. It shows all seven members of the DeFeo family in a
          group, hugging each other with smiles on their faces. The
          sound of children singing the nursery rhyme "Ring Around a
          Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes through the house.

          that area. I would clean my mother
          when she lost control of her bodily
          functions during her illness. It's
          something I got used to very
          quickly. It became routine.

</b>          I'm sorry to hear that. So... it's
          important to me that every employee
          here, whether they are a
          psychiatrist, an orderly or a
          cleaner, needs to fully understand
          what our mission statement at this
          hospital is.

<b>                          MIXTER
</b>          High Hopes was only built two years
          ago and as an institution we have
          only been running for just over a
          year now. So we're still building
          our reputation. But I am very clear
          on what I want that reputation to
          be. I intend to make this
          institution one of the foremost
          centres for mental health treatment
          in the country. If you look into my
          history you'll know that I have a
          stellar reputation in the field of
          psychiatry and I want to use that
          to help others. That is why I have
          put my own money into the creation
          of this institution. We are only
          just starting out but we have a
          long term ambition to be considered
          the best. So what I require is that
          every person who works at this
          institution, in any capacity, must
          be professional and sensitive to
          the needs of the patients. Unlike
          other institutions, the welfare and
          care of our patients comes first
          here.

          Lisa, completely mortified, sits back down. An unimpressed
          Mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue. When
          he's done he stares at Lisa.

          specialist stain remover that you
          must use if there are any stains on
          the floor or carpet. It needs to be
          sprayed and left to set for twenty
          minutes before scrubbing or
          mopping. It's a special formula for
          tea, coffee, water marks and other

           duties will be emptying the bins,
           hoovering the carpeted areas and

          sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth.
          He has wild hair and a scraggly beard.
                         
<b>                          DELANEY
</b>           That's Jerry Kimble. He was
           convicted of stabbing a young
           mother forty-nine times in front of
           her two year-old son, then killing
           and sexually assaulting a woman
           before smothering her four-year-old
           daughter. They call him the Green
           Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing
           but was certified insane and his
           lawyer got him transferred here. He
           doesn't make any noise or fuss, but
           he is a dangerous man. Especially
           towards women. This next inmate is
           even worse.
          Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next
          door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside.
          Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man
          stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his
          back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes
          that stare at Lisa. He smiles. Delaney slides the hatch
          shut.

           The Long Island Cannibal. He was
           abused as a child so his targets
           were always paedophiles and
           rapists. He'd track them down and
           torture them. He would eat parts of
           their body while they were still
           alive.

           months ago. No one knows where he
           came from, he literally just turned
           up late one night. An orderly found
           him wandering the grounds. First of
           all he was like Missus Hardesty
           upstairs-catatonic. Then a few
           weeks later he started to respond
           to Doctor Mixter and the nurses
           through facial expressions and
           gestures. But soon, he got violent.
           Very violent. He'd have bursts of
           rage and beat other patients. One
           day he appeared to have a seizure
           and collapsed. A young doctor tried
           to take his vital signs. Patient X
           here throttled him so hard he
           crushed his larynx. It took six
           orderlies to restrain him. Now they
           won't even let him out for the
           obligatory hour a day exercise. We

          the bucket on the floor and starts mopping.

          flickering from underneath one of the cell doors. She walks
          over and slowly reaches for the hatch. Sliding it open Lisa
          peers inside. In the centre of the floor she sees a needle,
          a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by Six
          lit candles. She looks around and nobody seems to be in the
          cell.
                         
          Suddenly SADIE jumps up right in front of the hatch! Lisa
          FALLS backwards, letting out an involuntary SCREAM! She
          stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs. Lisa slams the hatch

</b>          Lisa is sleeping fast as night falls outside. All we can
          hear is the rhythm of her breathing and the gentle ticking
          of the clock by her bedside table.
                         
          Suddenly her EYES snap open. We pull back and see that Lisa
          is now stood in front of LARGE WOODEN DOORS. The doors open
          and she steps inside.

          Lisa enters a Church full of powerful religious imagery. On
          the right side of the entrance she notices a Font. A drop of
          blood pierces the blessed water. As Lisa walks down the
          aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and
          she is moving in slow motion. White feathers cover the
          aisle, bouncing around her bare feet. An open Bible rests on
          the Lectern, the pages fluttering as if there is a strong
          breeze blowing them. Lisa looks up at a crucifix on the

          wall, the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares
          at her. Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down
          Christ's face. As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a
          female figure sat in the front pew. Lisa ebbs closer. The
          figure turns. It's LISA'S MOTHER.

</b>           Of course I do.
          Suddenly tears of BLOOD run down Lisa's cheeks.
          Lisa's mother reaches out a hand. Lisa stretches her arm out
          to grab her mother's hand. Everything is in slow motion, it
          seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand.
          Suddenly a BLACK GLOVED HAND grabs her outstretched arm. She
          turns to see a HOODED FIGURE, face shrouded in darkness,
          standing next to her. A deep voice echoes around the church:

          The door creaks open. Lisa looks nervous. She walks in with
          her mop and bucket and heads to the end of the corridor. She
          begins mopping the floor. As she mops past Sadie's cell she
          hears a knock on the inside of the cell door.

          slides open the hatch.

           Palmer?
                         
<b>                          PALMER
</b>           Sorry to bother you Mister
           Pemberton. But I wondered if it
           would be possible to get some
           medical attention?
                         
          Palmer holds up his arm and it's been slashed open. Blood
          pours from the wound.
                         
<b>                          PEMBERTON
</b>           Now how the hell did that happen?
                         
          Palmer holds up a makeshift knife.
                         
<b>                          PALMER

           weapon on the floor and back away.
                         
          Palmer obliges with a smile on his face. Pemberton unhooks a
          truncheon from his waist belt.

          Palmer willingly follows the instructions. Pemberton takes a
          set of keys from his belt and unlocks the cell.

<b>                          PEMBERTON

          A nervous Pemberton fumbles at his belt, trying to unhook a
          pair of handcuffs. Palmer slowly starts to back into him.
                         
<b>                          PEMBERTON

          Palmer moves faster. Pemberton swings for him but Palmer
          ducks it and spins around, pushing Pemberton into the wall
          knocking him to the floor. Palmer aims a swift and savage
          stamp at Pemberton's head. His skull crushes against the
          cold hard floor. Blood spatters all over the white cell.

          Hardcastle enters. He sees the door of Palmer' cell open and
          slams a large red button on the wall next to the entrance.
          Hardcastle takes out his truncheon and cautiously approaches
          Palmer' cell. Looking inside he sees Pemberton crumpled on
          the floor in a pool of his own blood.

          A SCREAM emerges from the next cell. Hardcastle rushes over

          Hardcastle turns the key and kicks open the door. They are

          the toilet. There is a hole in his head with part of his
          BRAIN seeping out. Palmer stands next to him, with blood on
          his lips and a plastic spoon in his hand. He smiles, blood
          covering his teeth.

          Lisa is walking down the hallway. She hears a SCREAM emerge
          from one of the rooms. She puts her ear to the door and
          hears the SCREAM again. Lisa kneels down and peers through
          the keyhole. In a clinical white room Palmer is strapped
          down on a table. His face is severely cut and bruised but he
          is conscious. Four orderlies hold his arms and legs while a
          fifth smears conductor on Palmer temples.

          The orderly places electrodes either side of Palmer' head.
          He then turns the dial on the ECT device up to full power.
          Palmer SCREAMS as he violently convulses, salivating heavily
          from his mouth. Suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he
          bites his own tongue off. Lisa is horrified as she watches
          the orderlies laugh as Palmer experiences a severe seizure.

          front of the door. A hand reaches out and GRABS her by the

</b>          It was a famous house. Or should I
          say infamous. Some guy shot his
          whole family there back in the
          seventies. Parents, brothers,
          sisters. Wiped out his entire
          family with a shotgun. Then the
          next owners of the house only
          lasted there about a month. They
          said they were driven from the
          house by evil spirits. The house
          became known around the world.
          That's why the recent owners sold
          the land, they had enough of all
          the media interest and constant
          tourists. Have you seriously never
          heard of the Amityville horror
          house?

          Louise attempts to pull Ronald Senior off Butch. Her nails
          dig into her husband's neck and draw blood. An enraged
          Ronald Senior grabs his wife's arms as she starts to slap
          him. Butch scrambles to his feet and rushes down the
          hallway. Ronald Senior remonstrates with Louise who is still
          trying to slap him.

<b>                          GLORIA
</b>           Ah yes, here it is. (Reading) In
           the 18th Century there existed a
           group of Native Americans in
           Amityville known as "The Satchem
           Tribe" led by Satchem Takapausha,
           the Chief. The tribe had fled Salem
           in Massachusetts to escape
           persecution by the Christians who
           were persecuting members of the
           tribe because of their Witchcraft
           practices. These practices included
           a ritualistic human sacrifice of
           six people (The significance of Six
           being related to the biblical
           number of man and creation) in
           order to induce the spirit of their
           God, The Dark Master, who they
           believed manifested his powers
           through his devoted followers,
           giving them immortality. The
           hundred strong tribe settled in
           Amityville but were later chased
           off the land by local Christians.
           Satchem accused the Christians of
           not properly compensating his tribe
           for the land. A war started and the
           Christians hired a hunter called
           John Underhill from Salem. At the
           site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue
           was later built in Amityville,
           Underhill killed all of the tribe.
           The Indians were buried in a mass
           grave on the site. Before he died
           Satchem vowed revenge. According to
           local legend, Chief Satchem is
           believed to have subsequently
           haunted the land. Various
           parapsychologists and mediums have
<b>           65.

           claimed that Satchem's vengeful
           spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo
           murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue
           and the haunting of the subsequent
           owners. Although such assertions
           are widely disputed.

          "The Satchem Tribe was a tribe of Native American origin
          that existed in the 18th Century. They fled Massachusetts and
          settled in Amityville where they were ultimately murdered
          over a land dispute. The Tribe was renowned for practices in
          line with Witchcraft and worshipped a God called The Dark
          Master. In 2009, it emerged that a modern cult incarnation
          of the tribe existed. They have adopted the traditional
          beliefs of the Satchem tribe but the modern followers are
          not required to be of Native American origin."

          of The Satchem Cult, a modern incarnation of a Native
          American tribe who practiced Witchcraft in the 18th Century.
          In 2009, Krenwinkel led ten members of the cult to 1005
          Dennison Drive where they subsequently tortured and murdered
          five individuals. One potential victim managed to escape and
          lead police to Krenwinkel. At her trial in 2010, Krenwinkel
          outlined the beliefs of the Satchem Cult, claiming the human
          sacrifice of six individuals would have given them
          immortality. As a result her lawyer submitted a plea of

          November 13th. Today. Lisa slams the file shut and the office

</b>          Lisa enters a small staff room. She SLAMS the door behind
          her. She clicks the lock. Lisa steps back from the door. She
          JUMPS as Patient X POUNDS on the door from the other side.
          Lisa looks around for a weapon. She limps toward the cutlery
          drawer below a sink. She rustles inside and finds a large
          butcher knife. Suddenly the door EXPLODES, a large hole
          blown through the middle of it by the GUN SHOT. Patient X
          reaches through, groping for the lock. Lisa reaches a large
          window in the room. She tries to lift the window. After an
          unsuccessful attempt at opening it she realises the window
          is nailed down.

          Patient X reaches for the lock. Lisa dashes to the storage
          cupboard and ducks inside.

          Lisa pulls the door shut and falls to the floor of the dark
          interior. Lisa faces the door, bracing herself with the
          knife held upwards. Everything is quiet. Suddenly the door
          SHAKES as Patient X THUMPS on it. The door cracks as Patient
          X SMASHES against it. Lisa crouches down with the knife at
          the ready.

          The gun BLOWS a HOLE right through the door. Patient X leans
          through the hole, peering down at Lisa crouched on the
          floor. He aims the gun through the hole and prepares to
          fire. Lisa brandishes the knife and thrusts it forward with
          all her might. The blade RIPS through Patient X's right eye.
          He SCREAMS and drops the gun in the cupboard before
          stumbling backwards into the staff room. Patient X clasps
          his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood. Lisa
          grabs the gun and stands up. Patient X looks at her with his
          remaining eye. Lisa aims the rifle through the hole in the
          door.

          BANG! The shot gun BLASTS a hole through Patient X's chest,
          blood splatters over Lisa. Suddenly a WHITE LIGHT fills the
          room and ALLISON DEFEO materialises. She is dressed in a
          clean white dress, her angelic complexion bears no wounds.
          Allison takes the hand of PATIENT X's corpse. The WHITE
          LIGHT swarms over Patient X's body and he rises to his feet.
          His head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe. He
          looks at Allison and they share a peaceful smile. Allison
          walks with Patient X through a doorway filled with a
          blinding WHITE LIGHT. They disappear and the light slowly
          dissipates.

           account of the evening. It was
           obviously a very harrowing
           experience and for me it was rather
           therapeutic to deal with my

</b>           Obviously we were all left very
           numb by events for a long time and
           I know a lot of people in the town
           felt we should close the

           occurred to me. I feel that people
           should be brought closer by tragedy
           and the Staff and I have definitely
           become closer, both as colleagues
           and friends, since the incident.

           institution in my opinion, so we

           to strength.

</b>           You mentioned there that some
           people wanted the place to close. I
           know many were also resistant to
           the opening of the institution in
           the first place given that it was
           built on the site of the infamous
           house, where Ronald DeFeo murdered
           his family in the seventies. I know
           a lot of people associated with
           that case were accused of
           exploiting it for their own ends.
           You've also faced some criticism
           for that, particularly as we heard
           last week that you have sold the

           me of hurting the memory of the
           victims but I feel I'm helping the
           memories of those involved live on.
           Granted, some victims were
           criminally insane but other victims
           were loyal staff who had families
           and I'm determined that they not be
           forgotten. Each staff member gets
           their own chapter in the book so
           that the readers can get a full
           picture of what wonderful people
           they were. I always say that all
           forms of media, whether it be
           books, newspapers, TV or movies,
           are a preservation of life. Our
           physical bodies may die but our
           images live on when we are famous.
           Our work and our passion is
           preserved, therefore it's as if our
           souls are preserved. Through all of
           these forms of media we are, in
           effect, immortal.

          a Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes around our ears.
