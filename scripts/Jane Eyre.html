<b>          EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
</b>                         
          First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed
          and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked
          with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of
          belongings over her shoulder.
                         
          She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,
          open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is
          running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
                         
          Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward
          until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.
                         
          She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself
          on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.
                         
                         
<b>          I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.
</b>                         
          The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running
          down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an
          approaching coach. She flags it down.
                         
          Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at
          her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod
          indicates she can get in.

          Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look
          shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early
          hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her
          emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -
          although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear
          the day, she closes her eyes.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.

          Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads
          meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door.
          With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.
                         
          She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open
          moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off
          at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane
          puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is
          not there.
                         
          She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding
          towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost,
          alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.
                         
          She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the
          gathering dark.

<b>          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.
</b>                         
          Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The
          night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She
          is trying to calm herself with a prayer.

          Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun.
          She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard
          crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR.
</b>                         
          Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light
          fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR.
</b>                         
          Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around
          her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her
          side, watching her. It is Helen Burns.
                         
          Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She
          sits up. She is alone.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.
</b>                         
          Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The
          sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the
          stones. Jane makes no movement.
                         
          A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled
          with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the
          bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches
          the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.

          It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the
          farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.

          Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould

          The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up
          at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold.
                         
          She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown
          walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns,
          looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.

          Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is
          struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.
                         
          She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed
          against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the
          point of despair.
                         
          The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her.
          Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light
          shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.

          Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the
          light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning
          shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on
          the gate.

          Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees,
          she peers through a window.
                         
          On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women.
          They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in
          black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides
          her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very
          young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee.
          They are talking intimately.
                         
          They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy
          that it pains Jane considerably.

          lifts her over the threshold into the warmth of Moor House.

          Rain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking
          hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide.
                         
          She springs behind a curtain. John Reed enters; a fourteen
          year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes. He
          is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword.

          the curtain across, making the window a private sanctuary.
          There is a book lying on the seat. She opens it.

          book - a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant. She runs
          her finger over it. We hear the sound of great waves
          plunging on to a shore.

          Suddenly the curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in
          front of her. Jane shrinks back.

          Dinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes
          off; one at each side of her. Jane is distressed,
          approaching a delirium. She resists them.

          Jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two
          servants, Miss Abbot and Bessie - one at each side of her.
          She is still resisting.

          The fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie,
          young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She
          has some compassion. Miss Abbot has none.

          The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge
          of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and
          curtains, murky in the fading light.
                         
          In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth.
          Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale

          Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room.
                         
          A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like
          fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of
          the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the
          pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in
          the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face,
          her eyes glittering with fear.
                         
          It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly
          grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror.
          She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her
          ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings.
                         
          Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something
          shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is
          surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking
          glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally
          rips from Jane's throat.

          Jane, aged ten, looks up. She is wearing a brown stuff
          frock with a puritanical cap like all the other girls.
          Silence reigns in the school hall.
                         
          A red haired girl of about thirteen stands up; Helen Burns.
          Miss Scatcherd holds up an apron in which a hole has been
          mistakenly cut.

          Helen Burns undoes the back of her dress. The punishment is
          given; a dozen sharp, stinging whacks with the birch twigs.
                         
          Jane is appalled. But to her astonishment and awe, Helen
          Burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression. As
          the strokes go on - seven, eight, nine - Helen seems like
          one in a trance. Jane is deeply affected.
                         
          On the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting
          party walks in: the Brocklehurst family. Miss Temple
          escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two
          smart, bombastic ladies. Mr Brocklehurst follows. Helen's
          punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet.
                         
          Jane, in a panic, drops her slate and breaks it.
          Brocklehurst's eyes sweep the room. They land on her.

          is the slightly bigger figure of Helen, hunched, the back
          of her dress still open, the skin on her neck raw. The sun

          Helen smiles a wide smile.
                         
<b>                          HELEN

          They hear the door. Helen runs back to her place; cowers.
          Miss Temple appears in a shaft of light at the door.
                         
<b>                          MISS TEMPLE

          The girls approach, dreading more punishment.

</b>           I shall investigate Mr
           Brocklehurst's claims against
           you, Jane. And unless they are
           proved, you will be exonerated.
                         
          Miss Temple looks over her shoulder.

          She quickly presses a slice of hard cake into each girl's
          hand and walks away. Jane and Helen look at one another,
          deeply moved by her kindness.

          Jane stands between Diana and Mary high above Moor House.
          They are dressed similarly in bonnets and cloaks. They
          watch a hawk dive, their heads moving in unison. Their eyes
          land upon Moor House.

           Diana and I will return to our
           charges in a few days and St John
           will go to his parsonage.
                         
          Down below them, St John leaves Moor House and walks
          towards the village. Jane watches him.

           for advancement here. Our poverty
           thwarts him at every turn and so he
           has chosen to lay all his gifts on
           God's altar.

          Jane is looking at the high wall which is the horizon of
          her world at Lowood. Her eyes come to rest on the main
          door. Two men are carrying a small coffin out of the
          school. Brocklehurst follows it with a menthol-soaked cloth
          over his mouth and nose. He becomes aware of Jane's eyes on
          him. He looks away.

          Jane is creeping down a corridor in her night dress. She
          peers in through the dormitory door. It has been turned
          into a sanitarium. Camphor and vinegar are being burnt.
          Jane can hardly look at the sick girls.
                         
          Miss Temple, pale with exhaustion, is speaking intimately
          to Madame Pierrot, the French mistress. Jane overhears.
                         
<b>                          MISS TEMPLE
</b>           This is the result of semi-

          Jane opens the door. A small bed has been set up at the
          foot of Miss Temple's. In it lies Helen Burns. A candle is
          set on a table at her side. Jane takes her hand.

          Jane is devastated. She climbs into bed next to Helen. For
          a moment, they hold each other. Jane's tears silently fall.
                         
<b>                          HELEN

          We see Miss Temple looking down at the bed in the dazzling,
          morning light. Jane, waking, has her small arms around
          Helen, as if fiercely protecting her. Helen is ashen, her
          eyes open, staring at some unseen thing. She is dead. Miss
          Temple lifts Jane away.

          Mary turns the page. It shows a sketch of St John Rivers.
          Mary gasps in delight. She takes the book straight to St
          John, who is diligently working at his desk.

          St John looks at the sketch of himself. He is quite taken
          aback. He looks over at Jane, who is quite embarrassed.

</b>           When I took over the parish two
           years ago it had no school. I
           opened one for boys; I now intend

          In front of her are about twenty village girls, aged from
          six to sixteen. They are hanging on her every word.

          Jane's first home is like a doll's house. She walks through
          it from the whitewashed bedroom with its little single bed,
          through the parlour with its tiny fireplace into the
          scullery kitchen. She retraces her steps back into the
          parlour. She turns round and surveys it.

          Silence but for the crackling of the fire and the blowing
          of the wind. She feels glad, grateful, but very, very

           (To Mrs Fairfax)
           Adele is going to show us her
           accomplishments.
                         
          Adele adopts a lovelorn pose. She sings an operetta song; a
          forsaken lady plotting vengeance on her lover. Her high
          voice warbles with pretended emotion. The effect is rather
          weird. Jane and Mrs Fairfax watch, open-mouthed.

          Adele's song continues as a voiceover. Mrs Fairfax is
          finishing a shawl. Jane is showing Adele pictures of little
          objects that she has sketched. Adele names them in English.
                         
          The song ends. Jane gives Adele a sketch of herself.

          Mrs Fairfax shakes out the finished shawl and puts it round
          Jane's shoulders, departing before Jane can protest.

          Jane holds a candle, the shawl around her; the moaning
          sound of a gale outside. She holds her candle up to the
          portrait of the voluptuous woman.
                         
          She stares at it curious, both as a girl and as an artist.
          She brings the candle close, to see how the brushwork has
          achieved the effect of flesh. She hears a low, knowing
          laugh in the darkness behind her. She is startled.

          Her own huge shadow is the only thing that moves. She hears
          the laugh again. She follows it through the darkness, alert
          with fear. A door clicks shut at the end of the corridor.
                         
          To her relief Jane sees Mrs Fairfax approach with a lamp.

          steep steps are revealed. Grace climbs them and disappears.

          Jane senses a presence behind her. She quickly turns. Mrs

          Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters.
          The exercise is lifting her spirits. The sun is sinking,
          turning the frost gold.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. DAY. A FROZEN WOOD.
</b>                         
          A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow
          trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly,
          acutely aware of everything around her.
                         
          Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across
          the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her
          feet echoes. She steadies herself.
                         
          She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A
          crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and
          begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if
          the whole winter is contained in it.
                         
          The moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the
          beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears.
                         
          Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which
          glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet.
          The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush
          of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before
          she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments
          startle both horse and rider.

          The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only
          to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall
          with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo
          with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying,
          trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.

          With much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to
          its feet. Rochester seems relieved.
                         
          He tries to stand himself. His ankle will bear no weight.
          He lets out an involuntary cry. It echoes:

          off the ice. He sits on a nearby stile. Jane approaches
          him. She now has the moon on her face. She begins to look
          less like a phantom and more like a girl.

          into the saddle, grimacing as he wrenches his sprain.

          Rochester's spurred heel makes the horse start and rear.
          Jane steps back. The horse bounds away, the dog rushing in
          its traces. All three disappear.
                         
          Jane doesn't move until the sound of hooves has faded away.
          Her face is flushed, her eyes glitter in the dark.

          Jane runs up to the front door. She pushes it open. To her
          amazement, there is a fire burning in the stone fireplace.
          The whole hall is lit. The double doors are open into the
          library. Mrs Fairfax is hurriedly approaching.

           He's in a terrible humour; the
           doctor has been. His horse fell
           in Hay lane and his ankle is
           sprained.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax anxiously hurries back into the library. A
          large dog wanders out. Jane finds herself looking at Pilot.
          She smiles.

          Jane enters. Rochester is in front of a superb fire - one
          foot bandaged and supported on a stool. Pilot is at his
          feet - and so is Adele, gazing adoringly at him.
                         
          Rochester is looking through Jane's portfolio of sketches
          and watercolours. Jane feels utterly exposed - as if her
          diary is being read. Mrs Fairfax timidly interrupts.

           her with her handsome, charmless
           lover. I overheard her waxing
           lyrical on all my defects - she was
           mercenary, heartless, senseless.
           The whole intoxication fell away

          Jane, aged ten, is walking along the long gallery. She
          opens a door and finds herself in the Red Room.
                         
          She stares into the mirror, searching the pale face of her
          reflection, as if trying to find an answer. A murmur seems
          to come down the gaping chimney; a woman's deep sigh.
          Jane's throat tightens with fear. Something moves in the
          shadows behind her.

          all doubt that something is there. She hears a low laugh.
          It seems to be right next to her. She tries to scream -

          Jane wakes. Her curtains are open; moonlight spilling in.
          She hears it again; the laugh from her dream, right outside
          her door - low and deep.

          Footsteps run away. Jane springs out of bed and pulls the
          door open. A door shuts at the end of the corridor.
                         
          There is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush
          matting, flickering in the draft. Jane picks it up. She
          notices something else - a curling wreath of grey smoke.
          She follows its trail through the pitch darkness. It is
          coming thickly from a half-open door at the front of the
          house - Rochester's.
                         
          Jane rushes in. Rochester's bed is on fire; the hangings,
          the curtains, all are alight. The flames are leaping.
          Rochester is asleep. She shakes him.

          Rochester only stirs. The smoke has stupefied him. Jane
          pulls the burning sheets off - then stops; he is naked. She
          takes his basin and douses the bed - soaking him.

          Jane takes the ewer and throws water on the curtains. She
          pulls the soggy fabric from its rail and smothers the
          burning couch. When all the flames are out, she rushes to
          the windows and opens them. Smoke billows out. She stands
          in the moonlight, coughing.
                         
          Rochester is sitting up, staring at her.

          Her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the
          arriving party; Rochester and Blanche, the dark beauty at
          his side. She is laughing at something. The sun shines
          behind her. Jane is dazzled. She turns away.

          Jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just
          as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. She stands
          back in a dark corner.
                         
          There is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. A
          flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. They
          descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist.
                         
          Jane steps out. She walks right into the path of Blanche
          Ingram, who is dressed in white. They both startle.
                         
<b>                          JANE
</b>           Excuse me, miss.
                         
          Blanche gives her a look of ice. Rochester is at the top of
          the stairs.

</b>           Good evening.
                         
          They both turn. Rochester has seen Blanche, not Jane. He
          offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration. Jane sinks
          back into the shadows.

          Blanche lays her gloved hand on Rochester's arm, barely
          touching him. They glide away.

          Adele and Jane sit on the stairs, listening to Blanche and
          Rochester sing. Their voices thrill. Jane is trying not to
          feel. But when Rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful
          note, she involuntarily closes her eyes.
                         
          Adele leans into Jane. She is crying.

          Adele makes a dainty curtsey - pink frock, hair in
          ringlets, little lace gloves. In the midst of the crowd is
          Blanche.

           What a love of a child.
                         
          Adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses.
          Only one guest is still looking in Jane's direction;
          Blanche. Her lip curls in distaste.
                         
          Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of
          refuge. She closes her eyes. A great Atlantic wave hits the
          sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
                         
          When she opens her eyes, Rochester is in her line of
          vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men. He senses
          her gaze; glances at her. Jane looks down, pulling her work
          on to her lap; a beaded purse. She does not lift her eyes
          from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class -
          and of her love. Blanche sidles up to Rochester.

          Rochester lets her hand go. He steps back. He goes to the
          morning room. Jane peers through the door, worrying how her
          last words have given offence.
                         
          She sees a man rising to meet Rochester; handsome but gaunt
          and painfully thin. His smile doesn't reach his eyes - as
          if his soul is not quite his own.

          Jane looks up to ask Helen for help. But Helen has gone.
                         
          Jane alone with her burden, teeters on the stool. The baby
          starts to cry. Jane panics.
                         
          The crying becomes deafening, terrifying. It is not a

          Overhead, the sounds of a struggle begin - a deadly one.
          Jane hears footsteps rush past her door. She starts to pull
          on her dress. She hears a man's voice from above:

          Rochester stops by a low door. He puts a key in the lock.

          He unlocks it. A room hung with tapestries; a four poster
          bed with its curtains half drawn. One part of the tapestry
          is hooked up over a hidden door - which lies open to an
          inner chamber. A dull, sickly light shines out.

          Jane obeys. Richard Mason is lying, one arm and all the

          makes her start by taking her wrist. He is trying to say

          A summer gale. The moan of the wind sounds almost human.

          A great box sits on the table, which Jane is opening.

          A form emerges, a woman, tall and gaunt, with thick, black
          hair hanging down her back. She is dressed in a nightgown -
          like a shroud. Over her head, she wears Jane's bridal veil;
          a phantom bride.
                         
          Jane is paralysed with terror.
                         
          The form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half;
          bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect. The last
          thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly.
          Her eyes are glittering with hatred.
                         
          The figure takes the candle and bends down to Jane. Her
          intention looks deadly. Jane's breath catches. She cannot
          breathe.

          He pulls Jane up on the horse in front of him. She curls
          into his arms, desperate for his comfort and his strength.

          The figure by the door steps out of the shadows. It is

          rage escapes him. He lifts his arm.

          A grim smile contorts Rochester's lips. He turns towards
          Jane. She remains where she was abandoned - at the altar -
          tiny, under he vaulted arch. The bouquet falls from her
          hand. Rochester walks to her.

          Mrs Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Martha and Leah are waiting.

          The tapestried room. Rochester glances at Mason. He unlocks
          the inner door with one hand; the other won't let go of
          Jane. Grace Poole sits by a strongly guarded fire, stirring
          something in a pot.
                         
          Rochester leads Jane and the men into the room. There is no
          window, no furniture except for Grace's chair; only a
          mattress on the floor.

          Bertha Antoinetta Mason stands, amazed at the sight of her
          visitors. She wears a white shift. There are black rook

          Bertha's pose is dignified, her expression grows
          triumphant. She approaches Rochester - her eyes locked with
          Jane's. Jane gazes: fear, disgust, compassion.

          Bertha puts her arm through Rochester's; lays her head on
          his shoulder; smiles at Jane, magnanimous in her victory.

          With shocking speed and strength Bertha lays her nails into
          Rochester's cheek. He struggles with her.
                         
          Grace assists Rochester. They do not hit; they subdue.
          Bertha's attack is effectively contained. They have her on
          her knees, her arms behind her.
                         
          Bertha lifts her head and screams. If a scream could
          express the agony of a whole soul then this would. Jane
          turns on her heels. She stumbles, finds the door, exits.

           with that demon-hate, that harlot,
           that succubus upstairs. My father
           wanted her money and so I was sent
           to Spanish Town and the match was
           made. I hardly spoke with her. I
           was dazzled, ignorant, raw. My

           her - gross, grovelling mole-eyed

           degrading agonies which attend
           those bound to the intemperate and
           unchaste. Her excesses developed
           germs of madness and the doctors
           shut her up. One night, unable to
           bear her screaming hate and knowing
           I could never be rid of her, I put
           a gun to my head to kill myself.

           died in that tropical place but for
           a breeze which blew in from the sea
           and smelt of home. With it, I came
           to my senses. Bertha Antoinetta
           Mason had abused my long suffering,
           sullied my name, outraged my honour
           and blighted my youth. It was
           enough. At that moment, as I
           decided to live, she ceased to be
           my wife.

</b>           Twenty years ago, a poor curate
           fell in love with a rich man's
           daughter and married her. She was
           disowned by her family and two
           years later the rash pair were both
           dead. They left a daughter which
           charity received into her lap - as
           cold as that snow drift I almost
           stuck fast in. Charity carried the
           friendless thing to the house of
           its rich maternal relations. It was
           reared by an aunt-in-law; I come to
           names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead.

</b>           It seems her career there was very
           honourable. She became a teacher
           like yourself, and left it, like
           yourself, to be a governess. She
           undertook the education of the ward

           professed to offer honourable
           marriage to this young girl and at
           the very altar she discovered that
           he had a wife yet alive. His
           subsequent conduct is a matter of
           pure conjecture but when the
           governess was enquired after it was
           discovered that she had fled
           Thornfield Hall and no trace of her
           has since been found. Now isn't

          Jane is walking through the orchard. It is wild, neglected.

          Jane finds herself at the side of the house. The ground is
          pitted with weeds. The windows are dark. She half runs
          round to the front. What she sees takes her breath away.
                         
          The great walls and battlements are blackened with fire.
          Windows gape on a hollow shell. The inside of the house has
          collapsed. Through the hanging door, only its charred
          remains can be seen. Weeds grow through utter devastation.
          Jane gazes in horror and distress.

          Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track.
          Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes
          to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between
          granite pillars. She walks through them.
                         
          She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor
          house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow
          grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.
                         
          Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He
          is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart,
          brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking
          sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a
          hawk. His strength is undiminished.
                         
          He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into
          the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough
          for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him,
          silent.
                         
          A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his
          right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky
          as if he is looking for something from there. He is
          absolutely still; his expression, serene.
                         
          Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a
          loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is
          immediately on guard, his expression turning wary.

          He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of
          it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back.
          Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.
                         
          He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns
          and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears
          into the dark interior.
                         
          Jane starts to breathe again.

          Pilot notices Jane. He leaps up with a whine, wagging his
          tail, madly. Jane spills half the water. She cannot help
          finding it funny. Her entrance has been ruined by the dog.
