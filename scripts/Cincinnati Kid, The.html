</b>
               Exterior scenes of St. Louis, particularly the riverside 
               industrial district. Even more important to establish than 
               the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters 
               would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes 
               as "Burst the Roosevelt Bubble," "Save the American Way of 
               Life," "Vote for Landon and Knox."

<b>               EXT. FACTORY - DAY
</b>
               One of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket 
               line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is 
               anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct 
               conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance 
               open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a 
               small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this 
               that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets 
               or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction 
               pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</b>
               A couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault 
               them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter, 
               dirty and noisy.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD
</b>
               The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are 
               clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the 
               SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening 
               on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER 
               of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.

</b>                         Somebody shut the goddam window. Let 
                         a man think.

               The player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also 
               owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. 
               Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table 
               look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, 
               extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself 
               the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid 
               have almost all the money on the table between them, about a 
               hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more 
               than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, 
               there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are 
               left in the hand.

               He turns over his cards, leaving it up to The Kid.

               He counts out the money, which is almost all he has.

                         He was dealing them high.

               Attending to first things first, The Kid has been pulling in 
               the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total. 
               Now as Danny accuses him again, The Kid looks him squarely 
               in the face.

               He walks off, disappearing through a door marked "MEN."

</b>
               He is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and Danny appears, 
               his right hand in his coat pocket. The Kid's hand goes to 
               his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor 
               appears in it, its blade snapped open. Pushing Danny to the 
               wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor 
               in the other, while he bolts the door. Danny gets his right 
               hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves 
               the razor blade against his neck.

               As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the 
               door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough 
               momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left, 
               dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles 
               his way out through a window.

<b>               SUPERIMPOSE: MAIN TITLES
</b>
               Danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door 
               just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to 
               get out of the building and after The Kid.

               The conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on. 
               The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to 
               run toward the railroad yards. A few moments later, Danny 
               and four other poker players appear and run after him.

<b>               EXT. RAILROAD YARDS - DAY
</b>
               The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits. The 
               Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and 
               they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track 
               on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the 
               station. His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting 
               beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst 
               of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. The passenger 
               train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we PAN with the 
               train into the depot.

               The train slowly stops. Amid all the atmosphere of arrival 
               in a day when the Pullman car was still the ultimate in 
               travel, LANCEY HODGES appears on a platform, takes his bag 
               from the Pullman porter and passes it on to a Red Cap before 
               he has descended the steps. He walks with other passengers 
               and Red Caps toward the center of the station.

               The Kid takes Christian's arm automatically; he watches The

               It is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where 
               Christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window, 
               turning over the pages of a mail-order catalogue. In f.g. 
               The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes 
               closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. He 
               opens his eyes and turns to look at her. The movement catches 
               her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid 
               the noise has disturbed him.

               She goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on 
               gently so the tub will take a long while to fill. Then she 
               takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns 
               to the bedroom with it. She stands in front of him waiting 
               for him to move, but The Kid is singularly listless. Not 
               till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his 
               face to the pillow. She goes right to work on his shoulder

               answers it.

               She gets no answer, which is no wonder in view of the noise 
               from the radio. But the radio is across the room and it's 
               slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed 
               she's on, and go to the door of The Shooter's room. She opens 
               this and we see The Shooter in bed in his own small quarters, 
               reading a magazine. He turns around inquiringly.

               The Shooter picks up the phone but before he speaks into it, 
               he pantomimes to her that he won't be able to hear over the

               she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a little 
               before she returns to her bed and her cosmetic chore.

                         As he put it, rather bluntly, I felt,

                         guarantee of a fair-and-square game

                         can do it, Shooter. Be a pleasure to 
                         see you again...

               It is midday outside but the window shades are tightly drawn

               asleep. Christian, dressed for the street, moves from the 
               bedroom to the kitchen-living room which is the remainder of 
               the two-room apartment. Finding paper and pencil, she writes 
               a quick note and leaves it on the kitchen table, then starts 
               out.

               that led eventually to the bikini.

               two of them could be Texas oil men. The youngest, a good-
               looking man of thirty, is BILL SCHLAEGEL. The Shooter, as

               up with four cards of one suit showing.

               goes to the bottom drawer of the dresser and opens it to 
               reveal a stack of money under a shirt. He takes five clean

               He doesn't actually hand her the money. He leaves it on top

               and pulls the zipper all the way down. She places her hand 
               over the mouth-piece of the phone.

               The Boy takes out a tobacco can with the lid torn off and 
               the top flattened down and shakes it, producing a sound like 
               the rustle of dry leaves. Then he produces a similar can 
               that makes a rattling noise when he shakes it.

               The Boy stands perfectly still for a few seconds, then begins 
               to shake the can with corn in it. After a bit he brings in 
               the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent 
               the rustle of the first can.

               At the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure, 
               delicate voice. It is catfish music created on the spot and 
               sounds strangely like the idle tunes Christian likes to hum.

<b>               EXT. CRAIGIE PORCH - CRAIGIE AND THE KID - NIGHT
</b>
               The two men are sitting just outside the kitchen, where Mrs. 
               Craigie and Christian are pasting labels on the mason jars 
               they filled earlier. The paste and some of the jars are just 
               inside an open window on a shelf behind the men's heads. The 
               light comes from a kerosene lamp inside.

</b>                         Let me get this straight in my head. 
                         Cards is all a matter of luck, who 
                         gets dealt the best ones.

               The Kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck 
               in his pocket. During the next few lines he uses the paste 
               on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to 
               form three double-thick cards. One of these has two faces, 
               another two backs, and the third a back and a face.

                         gamblers sits down with a bunch of 
                         your -- what do you call them --

               He displays his three cards.

<b>                                     KID
</b>                         You see one of these cards is white 
                         on both sides, one is red on both 
                         sides, and the other is white on one 
                         side, red on the other.

<b>                                     CRAIGIE
</b>                         What about it?

               The Kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall.

<b>                                     KID
</b>                         This. I put the three cards in a hat 
                         and shake them up, and then I ask 
                         you to draw one card out blind. Put 
                         it face down on the table so neither 
                         of us can see the bottom side.

               Craigie does as instructed. The ensuing dialogue assumes the 
               card he picks is red on top; if it's white the words "red" 
               and "white" will be reversed in the dialogue.

</b>                         Okay, red on top. That eliminates 
                         the all-white card, right. So the 
                         card you've picked is one of two -- 
                         the all-red or the red-and-white. 
                         One out of two is an even chance, an 
                         even-money proposition. Right -- you 
                         follow me?

</b>                         So if I said I'll bet you a dollar 
                         to seventy-five cents the other side 
                         of that card is red, you'd take the 
                         bet wouldn't you?

</b>                         And that answer makes you a sucker. 
                         Because the odds are two to one, the 
                         other side of that card is red, and 
                         I ought to be offering you a dollar 
                         to fifty cents instead of seventy-
                         five.

                         possibilities.

</b>                         There are three possibilities.
                              (indicating card on 
                              table)
                         That can be the red side of the red-
                         and-white card, or it can be either 
                         side of the all-red card. In two 
                         cases out of three the other side is 
                         red. And I'd win the bet from you 
                         two out of every three times we made 
                         it.

                         two things that the bottom side can 
                         be, red or white --

                         two to one. And knowing that is the 
                         difference between your gambling man 
                         and your sucker. Not who gets the 
                         better cards but who knows what the 
                         proper odds are. In a poker game 
                         there can be a million different 
                         situations, each with a different 
                         set of odds to figure. The man who 
                         ends up winners is the man who knows 
                         when to bet and how much...

               The sun hasn't risen yet as The Kid boards the bus for St.

               The clock above the loading platform says it is a little 
               after two in the morning as the bus pulls up, and The Kid, 
               groggy from the long ride, gets out.

               He enters wearily, goes straight into the bedroom and 
               collapses on the bed. After a moment he summons the energy 
               to loosen his shoelaces and kick his shoes off. But that 
               completes his preparations for sleep.

               The Shooter is awake because he can't sleep, and Melba is 
               awake because she is trying to persuade him to do what she 
               considers prudent. He sighs deeply as she solicitously pours 
               him a cup of coffee.

               Lancey is also awake, confronting a row of medicine bottles. 
               He finishes laying out an assortment of four different pills 
               and capsules, pours himself a glass of hot milk from a carafe, 
               and proceeds to take the pills one at a time, with a sip of

               The Kid, looking completely refreshed, is readying himself 
               for the game. He has chosen casual, comfortable clothes, and 
               now he collects three items to take with him: a large bottle 
               of mouthwash, a green sun-vizor, and finally, his stake. 
               When he withdraws the money from the dresser drawer, we can 
               see the pile has increased in size. The Kid finds an envelope 
               to put it in, and he is ready to go. He starts out but in 
               the middle of the kitchen he stops to look at his watch. It 
               is too early. He crosses to the stove, pours himself a cup 
               of coffee, and sits down to drink it.

               Lancey has decided on a change of costume from his last game, 
               and this time he goes for the old-fashioned velvet smoking 
               jacket and silk foulard. Over this he puts on a light 
               overcoat. Then he assembles medicines, toilet articles and 
               money, putting them all into a small satchel. Finally, he 
               puts on his hat and goes to the door.

               The old, solidly built wooden table has been covered with a 
               white linen cloth on top of a blanket. The cloth is tied 
               down under the rim so that the surface of the table is flat, 
               tight and cushioned by the blanket. The Kid presses his 
               fingers into it to test these factors.

               He puts his money out without counting it, takes a deck of 
               cards, rips the cellophane off it, takes the jokers and tosses 
               them offhandedly to one side, not seeming to take aim.

<b>               FEATURING THE JOKERS
</b>
               Heads turn as the cards sail through the air in unison, 
               landing inside The Shooter's familiar hat, which is resting 
               crown down on the mantelpiece. The spectators gape at the 
               display of dexterity.

<b>               FEATURING THE SHOOTER
</b>
               He begins to shuffle and all eyes are upon him, not from 
               suspicion but from pure admiration. He is in peak form, 
               shuffling six times, once for each player and then slapping 
               the cards down before Lancey, who is to the right of him, 
               with an empty chair in between.

               He waives his privilege of cutting with a barely perceptible 
               nod.

</b>
               The Shooter acknowledges the compliment with the same sort 
               of gesture. Then he begins to deal in his magnificently 
               precise way, pitching each card so that it comes to a stop 
               six inches in front of the player's money and in clear view 
               of everyone at the table.

               With Sokal in b.g. It is notable that as The Shooter completes 
               dealing hole cards and switches to the first up card, there 
               is no visible difference in the motion of his hands. He calls 
               the cards as he deals them.

               Unhesitatingly, The Shooter pulls in the cards, separates 
               them into four or five piles, and tears each pile in two. He 
               glances around, and Hoban comes up behind him. The Shooter 
               hands him the torn-up cards and unseals another pack, going 
               through the same routine of throwing the jokers into his

               It is around midnight, and there is a more settled look to 
               the game; some of the players have removed their coats, and 
               there is a good deal of smoke in the air. The Kid has a cup 
               of coffee by him, presumably with brandy in it; Lancey has 
               his frappe; Pig is drinking whiskey; the Shooter and Yeller 
               have bottles of bear. It is the end of a hand. With about 
               six hundred dollars in the pot, Pig, who has been called, 
               turns over his hole card triumphantly.

               up cards and tosses them in front of The Shooter. Pig suddenly

               card, but Lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards 
               into the pack The Shooter is assembling.

               Pig is suffering, weighing the advantages and disadvantages 
               of making the dread admission. Finally he nods. The Shooter 
               takes a ten dollar bill from his own stake, and the other 
               four remaining players each add a ten. The Shooter pushes 
               the money toward Pig.

               The other players look at The Shooter to see if he is going 
               to accept this statement at face value. He nods, that he 
               does, and each man contributes another ten. The Shooter passes 
               the second fifty to Pig.

               She walks past CAMERA and a moment later comes the SOUND of 
               the door closing behind her. The Kid, who has moved into the 
               bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his 
               undershorts and trousers. He returns to the bathroom, using 
               the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and 
               puts on his shorts and trousers.

</b>                         Fine. How's the game going?

               The Kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to 
               give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off 
               the soap.

               He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing. As his 
               movement brings him fairly close to Christian, he realizes 
               he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting 
               his shirt on.

                         important.

               To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both 
               affection and guilt. The idea that she can be any use to him 
               against Lancey is one he can't grasp.

               Felix jumps into action again. He moves to The Kid's side, 
               reaches into a breast pocket and takes out a switch blade, 
               which he clocks open an inch or two from The Kid's neck. It 
               is an extremely ugly-looking and menacing weapon.

               Slowly and deliberately, revealing nothing in his face, he 
               reaches into his breast pocket and takes out a slim wallet 
               and begins to let the bills flutter out on the table. The

                         message for you and I'm going to see 
                         it delivered.

               The Kid looks at him, looks at Lancey and Lady Fingers, 
               wondering about what Schlaegel has said, angry about it.

               Schlaegel nods, moves to the door.

                         doesn't it? Making the wrong play at 
                         the right time.

                              (then, as Lancey looks 
                              at him and doesn't 
                              answer)
                         You were crazy -- odds are three

                         I don't play a percentage game. I 
                         play stud poker my way. And I got 
                         the money and you got the questions. 
                         Figure that out.
                              (then, not unkindly)
                         You're good. But as long as I'm 
                         around, you're second best, Kid... 
                         and you might as well learn to live 
                         with it.

               The Kid looks at him and doesn't answer.

               He smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door.

</b>
               Lancey stops surrounded by a crowd of admirers offering their 
               congratulations. The Kid watches for a moment then takes a 
               long drink out of the bottle and eases through the crowd and 
               out the door.

               He turns a corner and there is a man blocking his path. 
               Suddenly three men move in behind him. He turns, trapped.

               The men are four of the original seven players he hustled in 
               the opening scene.

                         foundry. It's the Cincinnati Kid

                         what you gave me.

               He moves toward The Kid.

               Christian doesn't answer. She looks at The Kid for a long 
               moment, then turns and goes. He watches her. She enters the 
               cab and it leaves. The Kid just stands there.

               look down at him. Then he comes up. He flattens two in the
