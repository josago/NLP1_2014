<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          A modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes
          sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in.
          In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his
          mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of
          WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he
          finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA
          FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the
          one who told me not to mess up the
          precious picture piles!
          he gives him a long, slow kiss.

<b>          PHIL (CONT ' D )
</b>          Minty fresh.

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          That was nice.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          It was nice.

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          Hey from now on when you change the
          toilet paper, could you just make sure it
          is out?

<b>                         PHIL
</b>
<b>                         (CHUCKLES)
</b>          Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's
          over!

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          Oh, believe me, we're just getting
          started, Phil.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          (reaches into picture pile)
          Look at this one of your Mom with me. I
          mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!

          ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands
          stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle
          deep in a manure bin.

<b>                         CLARA
</b>
<b>                         (LAUGHS)
</b>          She just takes a while to warm up. You
          guys are gonna be best buddies. You
          picked a favorite of us yet?  

                         

<b>          2.
</b>          Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.

<b>                         CLARA (CONT'D)
</b>          That's exactly the one I picked!

          Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.
          It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look
          joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front
          of them.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          Man, I wish I was them.
          Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades
          as she stares at the picture. He notices.

<b>                         PHIL (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         WHAT IS
</b>
<b>                         CLARA
</b>          I just... when I was growing up my Mom
          and Dad had a picture just like this.
          Now they can't even acknowledge each
          other.
          Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.

<b>                         CLARA (CONT'D)
</b>          Let's always remember to have some time
          that's just for the two of us. No matter
          what else comes up in our lives - if it's
          work or friends or when we have kids-

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          We're having kids? With an "S"?

<b>                         (CLARA LAUGHS)
</b>          OK fine. But I promise you it's never
          gonna happen to us.

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that
          when I'm long in the tooth.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          You'll be even hotter long toothed.
          Right now to be honest Clara they're a
          little stumpy.

</b>
<b>                         (GIGGLES
</b>          Oh really?
          As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and
          turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of
          pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         CLARA (CONT'D)
</b>          Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          wasn't the pictures.

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          You know how long that took?

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          We'll fix the picture piles, Clara.
          We've got all the time in the world.
          From now on everything's gonna be just
          about us.
          Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.

<b>          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING
</b>
          Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an
          ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.

<b>                          E

</b>          Mo-om!
          It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan
          in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER
          while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a
          T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each
          side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite
          directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the
          hall and Phil to the bathroom.

<b>          OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Mom! Mom! Mom!

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          I'm coming, Ollie!

<b>          INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
</b>
          As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's
          bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil
          showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the
          doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack
          of PAPERS in his hand.

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          Uh Phil?

<b>                         0

          Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          Yep?

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          I need to switch. I've got an open
          house.
          Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but
          contains it.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          Really?

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          Yeah. Really.
          As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands
          together.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          OK, so I say today we go for the slacker
          look - cool yet approachable.

<b>                         OLLIE
</b>          Yeah, well Mom says that.
          Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          Oh. Well... that's cool too!

<b>          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME
</b>
          The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly
          through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin
          SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.
          She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then
          stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing
          a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.
          As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as
          well.

<b>                         CLARA
</b>          Ech. Mine.
          She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts
          brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of
          razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.
          Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to
          discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and
          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.

</b>          Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the
          holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.
          As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad

<b>          NT. KITCHEN
</b>          Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as
          Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits
          at the table. Phil finally notices.

<b>                         PHIL

</b>          Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob
          today. What's it gonna be?
          Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign
          of his tom.

<b>                         OLLIE
</b>          How about... some Captain Crunch?
          Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.

          Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out
          cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed
          in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.

</b>          One bowl a day a week.
          Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already
          in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.

<b>                         PHIL (CONT'D)

          As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie
          and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking
          back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the
          phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He
          stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly
          returning the carton to the fridge.

          Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
          off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly
          kisses Phil on the cheek.

<b>          CLL. -- (CONT ' D )

</b>          Sorry for the milky mouth.
          He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1
          dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,
          then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk
          in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her
          head, she tosses the carton in the trash.

          As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
          next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks
          a newspaper off his lawn.

<b>          CHAZ (O.S.)

          ike you say to me every morning.
          Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and
          Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'
          car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
          inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING
          STUCK halfway.

</b>          Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and
          peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.
          Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger
          side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the
          front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear
          and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's
          seat.

          The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD
          CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of
          it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his
          window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in
          slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR

          Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each
          move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,
          cleaning and inspecting.
          The divorce was the best thing that ever
          happened to me. Seriously. You know

          the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out
          a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a
          SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she
          passes.

          Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through
          the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a
          weird, loud buzzing noise.

          the side and silencing it.

          heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods

          I feel like we're in good hands for the E
          first time tonight.
          As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets
          out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood.

          Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke
          doesn't get his sarcasm.

          shoulder strap before getting out of the car.

</b>
          Through the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara
          walking toward the back of the building.
          In the foreground, A SHADOWY GUY watches them, then
          whispers into his walkie.

<b>          FBI BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
</b>          Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish
          to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and
          Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and
          Clara FREEZE behind them.
          At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in
          bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of
          them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in
          charge, yells to them.

          Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and
          Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara's arm.

          Holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun...
          .but BOBBLES it and it falls to the ground, right at
          Phil's feet. Looking down, Phil instinctively GRABS IT,
          holding the gun to Holbrooke's head.

          Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward
          the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but
          it's locked.

          Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the

          The Agents try the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1
          tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass,

          Reaching the bottom of the stairway, Phil and Clara,

          It's a CAVERNOUS ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION that's been

          The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's

</b>          Maybe because according to the paperwork
          you've got there, he owns Falconwood.

          pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called
          Eurostruct - which rents the city all of
          its construction equipment.

          Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns
          his gun on them.

</b>          The more violations Falconwood finds, the
          longer Eurostruct rents the equipment.
          That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor.
          I'm sure that's not a moral problem for
          you, but he's kind of screwing you in an
          election year, isn't he? Some of us are
          pretty pissed off about the roads.

          Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket
          pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck.

          With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the
          WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the
          wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just
          revealed.
