<b>INT.  SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</b>
Blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit
in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES,
a 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing.
Reading from prepared material:

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          ... last few years have brought many
          advances in the interests of women
          in naval service, particularly in
          the land-based maritime specialties.
          What's more, the Navy has instituted
          special sensitivity courses with an
          eye on --

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based
          maritime specialties." Gimme a
          second here to de-euphemize that...

At the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to
ponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card
reads "CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE." DeHaven is a
tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60.
In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --
and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Would that be anything like
          "typing"?  "Restocking the
          cupboards"?  That sort of thing, Mr.
          Hayes?

CHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go
stone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile.

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          Hardly the case, Senator.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Well, I'm just an old dame without
          much time left, so you'll pardon me
          if I jump right in here before they
          discontinue my blood-type.  I am
          deeply concerned over the Navy's
          seemingly incontrovertible attitude
          toward women in the military.  Case
          in point...

On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members
of the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.  And it jars him.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          "The Lark Report."

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          Madam Senator... this is an internal
          document of the U.S. Navy.  I must
          seriously question whether --

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>                  (to others on panel)
          The Navy's conclusion regarding the
          crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft
          carrier.  Female aviator, it just so
          happens.
                  (to Hayes)
          You're familiar with this report and
          its conclusion, am I right?

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          I was one member of the investigating
          commission.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Yes, I see your signature right here
          -- twice the size of everyone
          else's.  And your conclusion was
          "pilot error," hmm?

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          I'm really not prepared for any kind
          of in-depth review of --

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          I'd like to think our next Secretary
          of the Navy would be prepared for
          anything, Mr. Hayes.

A humorless smile.  She's roasting his nuts over an open
fire, and everyone knows it.

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          The commission concluded that the
          aviator in question failed to
          execute a proper approach to the
          carrier.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          That aside for the moment, I'm
          struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit
          of your report... the degrading
          remarks by other aviators...
          innuendo about her performance in
          unrelated situations... even a
          reference to her sexual activity the
          weekend prior.
                  (closing report)
          In my seven years on this committee,
          I've never seen a downed aviator
          treated like this.  Never.  I'm
          deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.
          Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for
          women in the military -- but for
          your own confirmation as well.


<b>INT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</b>
Heading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a small
<b>PRESS RETINUE.
</b>
<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          ... a full 35 percent of all jobs in
          the U.S. military are still, to this
          day, off-limits to women.  And
          that's simply gotta change.

<b>                         PRESS #1
</b>          What about those who say women
          aren't suited for all jobs?  That
          they're physically weaker... they
          have less stamina...

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Sure.  And we're gonna hog the
          bathroom, too.

DEHAVEN'S AIDE catches up, pulls her aside.

<b>                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE
</b>          White House boys want a private
          meeting.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          I'll act surprised.


<b>INT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</b>
Shoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high
stockings while devoting one ear to...

<b>                         WHITE HOUSE #1
</b>          ... to reassure you that he has
          every faith in the ability of Mr.
          Hayes to guide the Navy into the
          next century.  The task, as the
          Administration sees it, is to
          acknowledge changing realities
          without losing traditional values.

A beat.  DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys --
#1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          'Zat it?  Ten minutes, nothin' on
          the table?  Sweetcakes, you best go
          back to the President and tell him
          to open up the phone book and start
          lookin' for his next nominee.

White House #1 looks spanked.  Taking over, #2 pops a
briefcase.  An inch-think report appears before DeHaven.

<b>                         WHITE HOUSE #2
</b>          Administration's plan for 100
          percent integration.  If female
          candidates measure up in a series of
          test cases, the President will
          support full integration within
          three years' time.

Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through
the report, absorbing by osmosis.

<b>                         WHITE HOUSE #2
</b>          It's your gender-blind Navy,
          Senator.  Surely you're not going to
          balk now.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Well, it's just that askin' you all
          to integrate the Navy is like
          sending a man to do a woman's job.
                  (a beat)
          How do you propose to handle the
          Combat Exclusion Laws?

<b>                         WHITE HOUSE #2
</b>          Keep narrowing the definitions.
          Keep redefining.

<b>                         WHITE HOUSE #1
</b>          We got around it in Saudi Arabia.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          By calling women "Honorary Men."
          Ingenious.

<b>                         WHITE HOUSE #2
</b>          C'mon, Senator, President's pitchin'
          right down the center of your plate.
          If women measure up to men, they've
          got the job.  You going to take a
          swing?  Or step out of the box?

DeHaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over.
Thinking light years ahead.


<b>EXT.  CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</b>
Buttoning up topcoats, the White House boys move down
marble steps to reach a pair of limousines.  Hayes and two
FLAG OFFICERS wait.

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          Well?

<b>                         WHITE HOUSE #2
</b>                  (shaking hand)
          Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.


<b>INT.  HAYES' LIMOUSINE - DAY
</b>
Inside the moving car:

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          So she picks the women, we pick the
          programs.  Seals?

<b>                         FLAG OFFICER #1
</b>          I'd go Special Reconnaissance.
          Every bit as tough -- and we have a
          60 percent drop-out rate among the
          men.

<b>                         HAYES
</b>          Then I suggest we start there.

<b>                         FLAG OFFICER #1
</b>          Doesn't matter who she picks.  No
          woman is going to last one week in a
          commando training course.  And I
          don't care who it is.


<b>EXT.  POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
</b>
Winterscape:  Dotted with ice floes, the Potomac wends
through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow,
morning water calm.  There's an almost hallowed beauty to
it all.  Soon we pick out...

A spot of day-glo.  Coming out of the mouth of morning.
Overtaking the floes.

CLOSER on JORDAN O'NEIL.  She pushes her flat-water kayak
downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time.
Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington
bridge, she passes...

Cars overhead.  Grid-locked by snow conditions.

In seconds Jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic
behind as she heads toward the Washington Monument.
Something BURRS from a life-vest pocket.  She rips through
velcro to free a cell phone.

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          All right, stand by, we're going to
          switch over to COMSAT...

A TACTICAL OFFICER reroutes the call via defense
satellite, cryptography flashing on terminals.  Lieutenant
Commander ROBERT ROYCE joins other Intel officers at a
conference table.  They're pouring over weather charts,
navigation logs, high-altitude NRO video.

<b>                         TACTICAL OFFICER

          to the North Korean shore, near a
          fishing village, "Tamyung."

<b>                         JORDAN (V.O.)

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Signals received only sparingly, in
          such a pattern that leads us to
          conclude it is a downed aviator
          trying to conserve his batteries.

<b>                         JORDAN (V.O.)

<b>EXT.  POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
</b>
Riding the current, Jordan blows a troubled sigh as she
accesses the file of her brain.  Drifting past the
Jefferson Memorial:

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          North Korean beaches are the best
          protected, most heavily monitored in
          the world.  The civilian population
          is so propagandized that it acts as
          an Early Warning system.  Extraction
          team has to be small and silent --
          I'd go with Seals over Delta Force.
          Problem is, don't want to hold a
          conventional sub off-shore for
          target practice.  Where's The Polk?

<b>INTERCUTTING:
</b>
<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Halfway 'round the world.  So that's
          the problem -- we can get the team
          in, just not out.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>                  (an inspired beat)
          Unless you Whiskey Run.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Blank faces here, O'Neil.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Quick-hit technique used by Capone.
          Rigged a getaway car with running
          boards and handles.  All his guys
          had to do was jump on and take a
          ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 --
          I doped it out as a contingency
          plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks
          up the package, links up with
          recovery sub.  But don't waste time
          opening and closing hatches.  They
          just grab the periscope and hang on
          for neutral waters.

A dubious beat.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          You expect the extraction team to
          ride the sub bare-back?  Is that
          correct, O'Neil?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Only four minutes to neutral waters,
          sir.  Why not?

Silence on the radio:  They're discussing her scenario
privately.  During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of
the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers.  On the far bank
lies...

Naval Intel Center (N.I.C.), bristling with communication
antennae.

Jordan stares at the complex, waiting for a response.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          All right, sending the
          recommendation across the river.
          Royce out.

The phone goes dead.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          No, thank you, sir.


<b>EXT.  SECURITY STATION - N.I.C. - DAY
</b>
Bundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian
employees transit a security station on their way inside.
Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and
balancing a collapsed kayak on her head.  She flashes a
photo-badge and double-times inside.


<b>INT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY
</b>
Jordan exits a locker room.  Smoothing out her Khaki
uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock
doors.  Falling in step:

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          That was good headwork, lieutenant.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Thank you, sir.  We hear back from
          the Pentagon?

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>                  (scoffing)
          Probably hear back from CNN first.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Hate this part.  Just sweating it
          out on the sidelines.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Intel has its own glory, lieutenant
          -- no matter how subtle.

Now they reach...


<b>INT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY
</b>
A circular chamber.  Dominating the ground floor is the
bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations.  On the
second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          By the way, I'll need that option
          paper by 11-hundred today so I can
          review it with Admiral Hanover.  And

On the upper walkway, a frazzled N.I.C. SECRETARY
appears.  She spots Royce and Jordan below.

<b>                         N.I.C. SECRETARY
</b>          Excuse me, but I have Senator

"Oh, really?"

On the phone, Jordan glances around.  Co-workers mull
within earshot.  Those out of earshot post E-mail memos on
Jordan's computer:  "Moving up in life."  "I want a full
report."  "Don't tell her who you really voted for."

<b>                         DEHAVEN

</b>          I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just
          that... Beggin' your pardon,
          Senator, but... do you understand
          that this involves combat training?

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          This is just a test case, O'Neil.
          But if it works out -- if you work
          out -- it could well change the
          Navy's official policy on women in
          combat.  Or, actually, its official
          non-policy.  Now who's your
          immediate superior there?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Captain Dwyer.  Technically.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          My office will fill him in and help
          expedite.  Look forward to meeting
          you at the proper time.  Jumping off
          now...

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Uh, question, ma'am.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Yes, dear.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Would I be the only one?  The only
          woman?

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          There'll be more to follow -- but
          yes, dear, right now you're the pick
          of a very large litter.  And your
          success would mean a lot.  Jumping,
          now...

The line goes dead.  Jordan hangs up catatonically.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Well, shit-a-doodle-do...


<b>EXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - NIGHT

A small gunkhole harbor up the Potomac.  Snow falls thick
and silent on overturned canoes, stored for the winter.
Beyond stands a clapboard rental house.


<b>INT.  JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
It's not so much furnished as equipped -- scuba gear and
wetsuits in the mud room, life vests on coat racks, a
training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room.
In the kitchen we find...

A naked man.  He's steeping tea.

<b>                         JORDAN (O.S.)
</b>          ... well, I survived Basic Training
          and three brothers -- so I know how
          to fight.  What scares me are the
          sexual politics.  I don't want to be
          turned into some poster girl for
          women's rights.

CAMERA FOLLOWS as the naked man carries a steaming mug
through the house...

Snow builds on a window sill.  Facing Jordan, the man
slides into the tub.

<b>                         ROYCE

</b>          Just like you would be.

<b>                         ROYCE

Dutifully, Royce massages her feet.

<b>                         ROYCE

          started the same time -- and now
          you're sitting in the upperdecks
          while I'm still down in the bullpen.

<b>                         ROYCE

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          You need operational duty to really

          to go operational... yet combat
          training is off-limits to people
          with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel.
          Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm
          beating my head on a big brass
          ceiling.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          So dump on me.

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          You're such a ball-breaker
          sometimes.  Especially at night.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Sorry.  But after our days...
                  (a thoughtful sip)
          So if I try this thing... if I ship

          here?

<b>                         ROYCE

          you wash out, I make it so that --

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Wai', wait.  What happens if it
          works?  Four months of training,
          three years of operational duty.
          What then?

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>                  (blowing a sigh)
          I don't feel like doing an option
          paper on the rest of my life,
          Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it
          happen.

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>                  (conceding)
          Sounded lame as soon as it came out
          of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be
          honest, okay?  Three years is a long
          time.  Don't ask me to predict how
          I'll feel then, Jordan, because I
          don't know.  And either do you.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          You know, right up until you said
          that -- I thought I did know.

Wounded, she gets out.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Jordan...

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up
          like such a tough call -- and then
          you go and make it so goddamn easy.
          Really, thank you so much.

She punches into a robe and leaves.  Royce considers
drowning himself in the tub.


<b>EXT.  CORONADO BRIDGE - SAN DIEGO - DAY
</b>
Jordan drives a top-down Mustang across the sweeping
Coronado Bridge, cityscape behind her, naval base ahead.

A flock of pelicans pace Jordan alongside the bridge.
Suddenly two NAVY HELOS BLAST overhead, scattering the
pelicans.


<b>EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
On base, Jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt
courtyard.  The is "the grinder," reminiscent of a
gladiator's arena.  She notices at one end...

A silver ship's bell.  Hung prominently.


<b>INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Excuse me, lieutenant.  I was told
          this is where I check in.

A DUTY OFFICER looks up to find Jordan across a counter.
In no particular hurry, the duty officer makes his way
over to check Jordan's orders.

<b>                         DUTY OFFICER
</b>                  (looking up)
          So you're the one.

Hearing, other workers look up.  Among them is a female
ensign, KATHY BLONDELL -- no makeup, no nail polish, no
concession to her sex.  Throughout, she'll watch Jordan
with more than passing interest.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Still don't have my bearings yet.
          Direct me to the officer's quarters?

The duty officer stamps her paperwork, returns it with
room assignment and keys.

<b>                         DUTY OFFICER
</b>          You'll proceed directly to the
          infirmary for eye tests, blood
          tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test.
          Uniform issue adjacent.  Then you're
          to report to the Base Commander.
          He'd like a word with you.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Fine.  And the officer's quarters?

<b>                         DUTY OFFICER
</b>          C.O.'s office can supply you with
          directions.  Enjoy your visit,
          lieutenant.

It's a nasty little barb -- one that Jordan decides to let
slide.  Jordan turns for the door.  Blondell catches up
with a base map.

<b>                         BLONDELL
</b>          B.O.Q., south side.  Take a
          starboard tack out the door.

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         BLONDELL
</b>          No problem, lieutenant.


<b>INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
A soft KNOCKING.

<b>                         C.O.

A YEOMAN opens the door.  Behind him is Jordan.

<b>                         YEOMAN
</b>          Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil reporting,
          sir.

For a beat, COMMANDING OFFICER (C.O.) TURRENTINE takes
stock of the female in his doorway, sizing her up like a
fighter across the ring.  Then he stubs out a perfectly
good cigar, rises with an amiable face, and touches the
back of a chair -- stopping just short of pulling it out
for her.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Yes, of course.  Please, have a
          seat, lieutenant...

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Thank you, sir.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I'm fine, sir.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          So.  We're still coming to terms
          with the exact protocol for this --
          for integrating the Spec-Recon
          training.  It may not always be
          smooth, but we're trying to make it
          as painless as possible for you.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Thank you, sir.  But I expect a
          certain amount of pain.

More stock-taking.  Is he looking at her hair?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Barber was my next stop, sir.
          Would've had it regulation sooner,
          only --

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Don't worry about it.  If it's off
          your collar and out of your eyes,
          that's all I'm going to ask.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Really, I have no problem with --

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          I'm not out to change your sex,
          lieutenant.  You'll have separate
          beds, separate heads.  If you have
          specific medical needs, inform the
          infirmary.  If a classmate or
          superior acts in an harassing or
          otherwise unbecoming manner, please
          inform me immediately so I can deal
          with it immediately.  Questions?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          None at this time, sir.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Then that's all I have to say.
          Dismissed.

Another smile, another phantom gesture on the back of her
chair.  If Jordan was expecting a fight, the bell never
sounded.  She rises, salutes -- then turns back at the
door.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Sir, I just want you to know... I'm
          not here to make a statement.  I
          don't want to make men look foolish.
          All I care about is completing the
          training and getting operational
          experience -- just like everyone
          else, I suspect.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          If you were like everyone else,
          lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be
          making statements about not making
          statements, would we?
                  (a beat)
          Take your leave.


<b>EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
The Spec-Recon TRAINEES loiter outside their open rooms,
pumping weights, hosing down dive gear, trading Walkman
tapes.  This is the last day of liberty they'll have for a
long time.

<b>                         MILLER
</b>          What am I scannin' here?

Other eyes quickly lock in on...

Jordan.  Across a grass courtyard, she walks the ground
floor of an identical building, trying to match key number
to room number.  Every door is open, every room empty.
Soon she feels the presence of...

The men.  They're disgorging from their rooms -- ten,
twenty, thirty of them -- all buffed and cut.  These guys
are what Hitler saw in his dreams.

Jordan picks up her pace.  Where the hell is her room?

On all three levels of their building, the men shadow
Jordan en masse.  Not hooting.  Not leering.  Just
assessing.

Jordan finds her room at the far corner of the building:
She's got the entire floor to herself.  With a last look
over her shoulder, Jordan vanishes inside.


<b>EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Special Reconnaissance.  Here you
          will be trained to infiltrate
          hostile territory... to be the real-
          time eyes on the ground... to
          recover assigned targets and, if
          need be, to fight your way out under
          adverse conditions.

CAMERA SURVEYS faces of the trainees:  MILLER, MCCOOL,
<b>SLUTNIK, CORTEZ, FLEA, STAMM, ENGLAND, NEWBERRY, WICKWIRE.
</b>We'll get to know them later.  Dressed in Navy greens,
they stand in formation -- ten rows, ten deep, helmets in
hand.  Pacing before them:

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          That is all that will be said about
          the special nature of this class --
          by us or by you.  Many of you have
          waited years for admission to this
          program.  Opportunities like this
          are rare -- and those who seize upon
          them are rarer still.

He approaches Jordan.  We can tell what she's thinking.
"Just keep moving.  Don't single me out."

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Other than that, there is little to
          be said but "Good luck, gentleman."
                  (correcting)
          "Gentlepersons."

Jordan flinches.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Now I turn you over to the chief
          training officer.  He has earned six
          naval commendations, the purple
          heart, and the Navy Cross for
          heroism and valor.  I give you
          Master Chief John James Urgayle.

Taking over, THE CHIEF stands before the class a moment,
sizing them up while giving them -- get an eyeload of him,
too:  His body is 30 years old, his face 40, his eyes 50.
An ageless warrior.  Somewhere, the blood of Ulysses runs
in this guy's veins.

The Chief lifts a bullhorn to deliver his opening salvo --
and it's anything but the kick-ass rant the class is
expecting:

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          The sun and moon... the ebb and flow
          of the Pacific tides... global
          warming... the very angle of the
          Earth upon its axis... these are
          just some of the things I control in
          my world.

Trainees swap private looks.

<b>                         MCCOOL

<b>EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - DAY
</b>
START on boots, crashing through shallow surf, spraying
water.  We assume this is a routine beach run -- until
VIEW RISES to reveal...

Telephone poles on their shoulder.  Working in groups of
10, trainees labor under 300-pound poles.  Jordan, six
inches shorter than most, looks like Atlas carrying the
weight of the world.  But she's doing it.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR

          down... three, four...

<b>                         CLASS CADENCE
</b>          One, two, three, four... One, two,
          three, four...

An ambulance shadows the class.  Perched on the front
bumper like an hood-ornament, the Chief keeps working his
bullhorn:

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          You may think that you are the
          brightest, the best, the strongest.
          I assure you, that is a total
          delusion on your part.  It is my job
          to show you just how weak human
          beings can truly be.  60 percent of
          you will not finish this course.
          How do I know?  Because that is an
          historical fact.

It's also intimidating shit.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Poles down.

The earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the damp
sand.  Approaching on foot, the Chief loads fresh
batteries into his bullhorn.  He does it like a man
thumbing rounds into a shotgun.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Now for the bad new:  I always like
          to get one quitter on the first day.
          And until I do, the first day does
          not end.  So look around right now
          -- go on, do it.  I wonder who it's
          gonna be...

He passes right by Jordan, never meeting her eyes.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO steps up.  He's the Chief's bulldog.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          Down to BVDs!

The guys strip down to boxers.  Jordan settles for boxers
and jog bra.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          Now face the Pacific... link arms...
          and take a stroll!

The class wades in.  The first wave takes Jordan's breath
away:  It's February, and the water is cold.  When they
move out of instructors' earshot:

<b>                         STAMM
</b>          What is it with the damn phone
          poles?  We sign up for Spec-Recon or
<b>          GTE?
</b>
<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          Just trying to thin the herd.
          That's all they want to do right
          now.

Some of the guys are glancing Jordan's way, cashing in on
a cheap wet T-shirt contest.  Jordan covers herself
instinctively -- and hates the instinct.  Modesty isn't
going to get her through this.

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          Man.  Doesn't she know it's rude to
          point?

<b>                         NEWBERRY
</b>          Wow.  You see that girl?

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          I got eyes, Newberry.

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          One night.  Just one night in my

          commando.

<b>                         ENGLAND

          heard with they said.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          Out of the water!

The class breaks for the beach.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Now make like sugar cookies and roll
          in the sand for me.

The trainees hit their bellies and roll.  Indeed, they
look like sugar cookies.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Collect those poles, gentlemen.
          Still a lotta beachfront you haven't
          seen...

Groaning, the trainees grab poles.  Jordan's pole, wet
slips from their collective grasp...

And bangs Stamm's ankle.  He HOWLS through his teeth.

<b>                         ENGLAND
</b>          How bad?  Stamm?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          We better get a medic over --

<b>                         STAMM
</b>          No, goddamnit.  No.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR
</b>          Up!  Up!  Up!  Up!

Stamm swallows the pain.  Poles go back on shoulders.
Looking like drunk centipedes, the class staggers off down
the beach.


<b>EXT.  MUD PIT - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
Wallowing in mud, the class does belly-busters, atomic
sit-ups -- and the sadistic reverse push-up, where
trainees lie of their backs, place hands under shoulder
blades and push their crotches skyward.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Pain is your friend.  You ally.  It
          will keep you awake in times of
          emergency... it will tell you when
          you are seriously injured... it will
          keep you angry and remind you to
          finish the job and get the hell
          home.  But you know the best thing
          about pain?

<b>                         CLASS
</b>          No, sir!

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          It lets you know that you aren't
          dead yet.

Instructors roam, RASPING ORDERS, kicking students into
proper position.  Jordan struggles with the reverses.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          Go regulation if you can't do the
          reverses, O'Neil.

She looks around.  A lot of the guys are having trouble
with the reverses, not just her.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Thank you, sir.  But I like these
          just fine.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I'll try anyway, sir.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          You'll try what we tell you to try,
          O'Neil.  Go regulation.

She switches to standard push-ups, her face disappearing
into the ooze with every downstroke.  Soon the Chief's
boots slosh into FRAME.  He's still looking for his human
sacrifice.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Who's it gonna be.  I just wonder,
          who is it gonna be...


<b>EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - SUNSET

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
</b>          On your belly... on your back... on
          your feet... on your belly... on
          your back... on your feet...

Whistle-drills.  Silhouetted against a lowering sun, the
students flop around like docked fish.


<b>INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
Blondell is ending her shift.  She shoulders a purse and
pauses at a window, seeing...

The trainees shuffling into formation like the living
dead.  Jordan is still among them.


<b>EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          You have noticed a ship's bell
          hanging at the west side of this
          courtyard.  If, at any time, you
          feel you cannot continue with your
          training -- that bell is your
          salvation.  Strike it three times,
          and the ordeal is over.

Nervous eyes flick to the bell.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Yes, it is a long walk.  So I'll
          make it as easy as I can.

He turns his back to the class.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Now you don't have to watch me
          watching you break rank.  Because I
          know someone here wants to do it.

CAMERA SEARCHES their faces.  There isn't one trainee here
who hasn't thought about it.  Including Jordan.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Now I know what you're thinking...

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>                  (low)
          I'm thinkin' we could jump him right
          now...

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          "Can I really take 15 weeks of this
          bubonic asshole?"  If you don't know
          the answer to that question, the
          answer is "No, you cannot."  And
          that is another historical fact.  So
          do it.  Admit you don't have what it
          takes... admit you are out of your
          depth -- or we're all heading back
          to the beach right now.
                  (waiting a beat)
          Instructors!  Time hack!

Following the Chief's lead, Instructors lift their dive
watches.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Six... five... four... three...
          two... one... HACK!
                  (to class)
          The time is now 12-hundred.  The sun
          is shining brightly.  Plenty of
          daylight left for another phone-pole
          run...

GROANS behind him.  The groans give way to the SOUND OF
BOOTS breaking rank.


<b>INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

BLONDELL'S POV:  Of a lone figure crossing to the bell.


<b>EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
QUICK CLOSEUPS of Miller, Slutnik, Wickwire, turning to
watch someone cross the grinder.  At least we know who it
isn't.

CLOSE on the Chief as the BELL RINGS THREE TIMES.  He
turns around to find...

Stamm at the bell.

For the first time, the Chief looks dead-bang at Jordan.
Was he expecting her?

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Leave your helmet there, Stamm.
          Back to the barracks.

Stamm drops his helmet and limps away.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          The rest of you should remember one
          thing.  The only easy day was today.
          Lieutenant Wickwire?  Turning it
          over to you.

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          Cuh-lass, face right!

They march off.


<b>INT.  MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
Dead-ass tired, Jordan slides her tray down the line,
piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories.
She heads for...

A table of trainees, one spot open.  Seeing her coming,
the guys shift position.  Suddenly the table is full.

<b>                         ENGLAND
</b>          Better look elsewhere, O'Neil.

Jordan glares.  None of them meet her eyes.  She wheels
around -- and now all eyes are on her, watching her ass
walk away.  FEATURE Slutnik, the walking sperm bank.

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          Half a night, Lord, just gimme half
          a night to set her straight...

Jordan tries another table.  This one, too, becomes
abruptly full.  As Jordan leaves, HOLD on Miller.  He's a
human eclipse -- six-three, 220, the perfect commando
physique.  Instructors wish they could clone him.

<b>                         MILLER
</b>          Average woman is 25 percent body
          fat.  That's one-quarter fat, man.
          Think about that.

<b>                         MCCOOL
</b>          Nice distribution, though.

<b>                         MILLER
</b>          No way does she makes this program.
          No way.

After wandering the mess hall like a homeless person,
Jordan finds refuge at a table with female mess stewards.
They look at her with blank faces.  No understanding.  No
compassion.


<b>EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
Jordan walks in a bathrobe, toweling her hair dry.  She
fishes for keys at her door.

<b>                         VOICE
</b>          It's not so much that they hate
          you...

Jordan looks.  Someone is sitting on an outdoor table,
smoking.  He leans into the light so she can see his face.
It's Wickwire, the mid-30s lieutenant who doubles as class
officer.  He's dangerously handsome.

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          They're more afraid of you.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Well, now I feel so much better.

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          It was made clear before you came --
          harassment equals career suicide.
          Can't say anything good, so they
          don't say much at all.  To your
          face, anyway.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Whose orders were those?

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          It was made clear.
                  (getting up)
          Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's
          hell, then it levels out.  Until
          S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's
          hell-and-a-half.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          And how do you know that?

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          Made it to Week 10 last time.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I didn't know they let you try
          again.  Especially at your age.

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          You're kind of a surprise yourself.

A faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across
the courtyard that separates the two B.O.Q. buildings.
Back across no-man's land.


<b>INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
Two beds.  Matching lockers.  A desk, a chair, a mirror.
All overwhelmingly dull.

Jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory
of her body.  Both sides of her neck are bruised from the
phone-pole run.  Her back and thighs are sand-burned.
Mirror cuts abound.  She's already a mess.

Jordan uncaps some cologne.  It's a vestige of her old
life she's not going to surrender.  She sniffs.  Savors.
Dabs.  Looks back in the mirror...

And breaks out laughing.  It's like dropping a rose in a
cesspool.


<b>EXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - CORONADO - DAY
</b>
A PHOTOGRAPHER stands near a car parked just outside the
base.  He's peering through a 600mm lens.

PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV:  FOCUSING through cyclone fencing...
PANNING past the sand dunes... and finding green-clad
trainees gathered at an obstacle course.


<b>EXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
An explosion of sand:  England and Wickwire belly-flop
into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire.  Clear,
they gain their feet and blitz toward...

The rolling logs.  They balance-beam their way to...

The rope climb.  Racing to the top, they reach a platform
and fling themselves down onto...

The high poles.  They land awkwardly, losing their wind
and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before...

Racing for the finish.  The Chief thumbs a stopwatch.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          England, 88 seconds.  You're good to
          go for the slide-for-life.
          Wickwire, roll back till you get
          south of 90.

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          Fuck.  Yes sir.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          Who'd you kiss to get back in here,
          anyway?

Wickwire dusts off and starts back for...

The starting line.  Stepping up next is Cortez, the human
fighting cock.  Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up
for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
</b>          Hang on, here...

He grabs something off a truck and positions it at the
base of the wall.  It's a little two-step platform.

SNICKERS, MOANS from the guys.  Cortez can barely contain
his disgust.

<b>                         CORTEZ
</b>          Aw, what is this...

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>                  (mortified)
          Sir...

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
</b>          Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but
          it's gotta go out.
                  (calling out)
          Five... four... three...

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
</b>          ... two... one... MARK!

Cortez blurs away.  Jordan starts a step late.

Cortez takes the wall clean.  Eschewing the two-step,
Jordan jumps right over it -- but jumps too far out
because of it.  She takes the wall awkwardly.

INTERCUT the others as they break rank to follow, eager to
see Cortez blow her off the course.

<b>                         CLASS
</b>          Lesgo, Cortez, LESGO, GO, GO!

Cortez belly-flops into the sand pit -- and snags going
under the barbed wire.

<b>                         CORTEZ
</b>          Shit of a saint...

Catching up, Jordan clears the wire without a hitch and
leads going into...

The rolling logs.  They both tight-rope across nimbly and
bound on toward...

Rope climb.  Jordan starts up at a decent clip -- but
Cortez comes from behind like a chimp on white sugar,
doubling her speed.

<b>                         CLASS
</b>          Take her, take her here, Cortez...
          lookit that monkey-man go... hoo-
          yah, hoo-yah...

Cortez reaches the top platform.  Now he's faced with...

The high poles.  He's seen others land sideways and pay
the price.  Trying another way, Cortez takes a flying
leap...

And WHUMPS down with legs astraddle.  He tried to cushion
the landing with his hands -- and failed magnificently.
His balls took the brunt.

Jordan WHUMPS down beside him with legs astraddle -- and
shoots Cortez a "Hey, no problem" look.  She rolls off the
poles...

And drops to the pit below.  Cortez lands right behind.
Now it's a flat-out sprint for...

The finish line.  He takes her at the tape.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Cortez, 93 seconds.  O'Neil, 94.
          Cortez, do a little rescue-recovery
          on your gonads and line up again.
          O'Neil... move ahead.

Heading back to the starting line, Jordan wheels around.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Say again, sir?

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          You heard me.  Move on.

<b>                         CORTEZ
</b>          Aw, this is such bullshit...

Others GRUMBLE in commiseration.  Jordan flushes with
anger.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Chief, sir, I don't understand
          why --

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Educate her, Pyro.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          Automatic five-second deduction,
          which slips you under the wire.
          It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil
          -- standard procedure for all
          females in physical training
          courses.  Where you been the last
          few years?

<b>                         JORDAN

          only --

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Twice now, I have said the words
          "move on."

He turns his back, leaving no possibility of discussion.
Jordan stares after.

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          Can't live with them, can't kill
          them.  What's the point?

<b>                         MCCOOL

          Just let it go.  If it's in your
          favor, just shut the hell up and
          take it.

to check...

The outdoor table.  No visitors tonight.


<b>INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan pushes inside -- and stops when she sees the little
two-step platform.  That awful crutch.  Someone has put it
beside her bed.

Jordan wheels around to check...

</b>
The men' building.  Slutnik and a few others loiter on a
balcony, mirroring her stare.


<b>EXT.  CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Hastily dressed, Jordan marches across the base.  Her
march turns into an angry run as she cuts through parking
lots... jumps hedges... and finally reaches...


<b>EXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
An on-base bungalow.  Jordan bangs on the front door until
the C.O.'S scowling face appears.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I can't afford civility, sir.  How
          am I supposed to fit in with these
          guys when you've got me set up as an
          outsider?  Even if I make it under
          these rules, I still lose, because
          there'll always be a flag in my file
          -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I
          mean, really -- why didn't you just
          issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear
          around the base?

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Did you just have a brain-fart?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Pardon?

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Did you just barge in here and curse
          at your base commander?  If so, I
          regard that as a bonafide brain-
          fart, and I resent it when people
          fart inside my home.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I think you've resented me from the
          start, sir.

Now, finally, her opponent steps into the ring.  And he's
a bare-knuckle brawler.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>                  (building)
          What I resent, lieutenant, is some
          politician using my base as a test
          tube for her grand social
          experiment.  What I resent is the
          sensitivity training that is now
          mandatory for my men... the day-care
          center I have to build where an
          officer's lounge used to be... and
          the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff
          just so someone can keep track of
          your personal pap smears.
                  (drawing close)
          But most of all, lieutenant, I
          resent your perfume, however subtle
          it may be, competing with the aroma
          of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty-
          nine cent cigar, which I will
          happily put out this very instant if
          the phallic nature of it happens to
          offend your goddamn fragile
          sensibilities.  DOES IT?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          No, sir.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          No, sir, WHAT?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          The shape doesn't bother me.  It's
          just that goddamn rotten stench.

A dangerous beat -- before the C.O. disengages.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Well.  'Least now we're talking the
          same language.
                  (a beat)
          So one standard.  Is that what
          you're after?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Same rules for everyone, sir.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Straight up?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Across the board, sir.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          And if you just happen to wash out,
          I won't have to contend with you
          bitchin' to some hairy-chested
          female Senator?  And please note I
          did not identify any one in
          particular.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Wouldn't dream of it, sir.

A deciding beat.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Then good night.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          So I'll get a fair shot?

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          You'll get everything you want,
          O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what
          you're gonna get.


<b>INT.  BARBER SHOP - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan gets her hair cut to regulation length.  It's over
in seconds.


<b>INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan slaps down old room keys and new orders.  Blondell
scans the paperwork with deepening concern.

</b>          Your new roommate.

Slutnik's face curdles.  Jordan dumps her bag on an open
bunk and starts unpacking.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Anybody usin' these drawers here?

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You

          right next to me.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Funny, the C.O. says I can.

She slaps orders on his chest, continues to unpack.

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          Aw, lookit this, lookit this --

          Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay.
          And if you don't want me for a
          roommate or classmate, you got two
          options -- move out or ring out.
          End of file.

Slutnik stalks out.  Jordan fires a look at the innocent
bystander here, McCool.  He was studying at his desk when
the fireworks began.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          What about you, McCool?  Any problem
          with the room assignment?

McCool -- an imperturbable black lieutenant -- just goes
back to his manuals.

<b>EXT.  OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

START on flares igniting overhead.  FOLLOW the flares as
they parachute down into the surf to illuminate...

The class, standing in one long line, arms linked.  As
black waves knock out their legs, we're reminded of show
girls kicking their way through some macabre review.


<b>EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
Firing flare guns and working their bullhorns:

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          58 degrees this morning!  That's not
          a bad water temp, really -- if

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
</b>          Slurred speech, lack of proper motor
          control, short-term amnesia -- all
          early signs of hypothermia!
          Advanced hypothermia is easy to

          you of the cultural barriers that
          dictate you should not invade
          another man's space.  Are any of you
          in a situation of extreme cold right
          now?

INTERCUTTING trainees and instructors:

<b>                         CLASS
</b>          Yes, sir!

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Then why aren't you all over the man
          next to you?

The class pivots 90 degrees and starts to close rank.
Behind Jordan, Montgomery (a.k.a. "Flea") hesitates:
He's a bantam-weight from Georgia, his manners bred into
the bone.  He just can't find a delicate way to grab
Jordan without mounting her.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Just do it, okay?

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
</b>          If you can't feel the other guy's
          pecker, you ain't in tight enough!
          I want nuts to butts!

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
</b>          Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break
          in that line?

Finally Jordan grabs Flea by the neck, pushes him ahead
and mounts him.  The class closes down into a long human
snake.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>                  (in his ear)
          Montgomery, why do they call you
          "Flea"?

<b>                         FLEA
</b>          It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" --
          but that gets whittled down to just
          "Flea."  For short, ma'am.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          So it really has nothing to do with
          actual brain size?

<b>                         FLEA
</b>          No, ma'am.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect
          you just showed me.  But I don't
          need it and don't want it -- not
          that kind of respect, anyway.  It's
          just gonna hurt us both, okay?

<b>                         FLEA
</b>          I'll work on it, ma'am.

<b>                         JORDAN

          Time.

<b>                         THE CHIEF

CAMERA POLLS the grim, blue-lipped faces in the water.
Jordan feels Flea starting to shake.  Badly.

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         FLEA
</b>          'Snot me.  It's him.

Two bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, Miller, who's
shuddering.  Jordan feels him shaking through Flea.

<b>                         MILLER

<b>                         FLEA

No answer.  Bad sign.  On shore:

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          22 minutes...

Ignoring, the Chief lifts his bullhorn:

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Remember, all this is completely
          voluntary.  For any of you who don't
          want to continue, Instructor Johns
          is now serving coffee and danish at
          the ambulance.

A portable light comes on.  Indeed, an instructor is
setting up coffee service.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Any takers?

<b>                         SLUTNIK

          dinner rolls?

<b>                         FLEA

<b>                         JORDAN

          That's exactly what they --

Suddenly the line rips apart.  It's Miller, breaking for
shore.

<b>                         CLASS
</b><b>          NO!
</b>
Soon the dyke is bursting everywhere:  Four others break
rank, following Miller's lead.

The deserters stagger onto the beach.  MEDICS close in
quick, draping them with blankets, shining flashlights in
their faces, asking brain-check question.

<b>                         MEDICS
</b>          Tell me what day this is... look at
          me now... what city are you from,
          sailor... here, look right here...

A medic nods to the Chief.  No hypothermia.  Not yet.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          You want another minute to think
          about this?  Huh?
                  (no response; to
                   Miller directly)
          Do any of you want to reconsider?

Avoiding his eyes, Miller wags his head.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Johnson.  Get 'em out of my scan.

It's a death sentence.  As the quitters slouch for the
coffee truck...

</b>          By my watch... which, of course
          appears to be broken... they've been
          in 27 minutes without the benefit of
          protective gear.

TIGHT on the Chief.  Scanning the remaining trainees.
Thinking about holding out out for one more.

TIGHT on Jordan.  Knowing who he's waiting for.  Wondering
if she can outlast him.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>                  (into bullhorn)
          Everybody out.

With a SHIVERING CHEER, the trainees stampede ashore,
grabbing blankets, trading body-bumps and high-fives.
Jordan gets swept up in the esprit:  They've conquered a
common enemy.  But when she tries to get high-fived...

The guys turn their backs.  It's a cold rebuff, worse then
any water.

HOLD TIGHT on Jordan.  Shivering.  Watching the guys drift
away.  Hating them.

<b>                         WICKWIRE

Blondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign,
tall and striking.  Passing the bell, Blondell checks
on...

The helmets lined up beneath.  A dozen already.

An O.S. CADENCE CALL -- then, led by Wickwire, trainees
double-time into the grinder, uniforms drenched from a
beach run.  Among them, still, is Jordan.  It brings a
Mona Lisa smile to Blondell's face.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO

Blondell and her friend.

Overhearing, Jordan snaps a look at Blondell, only now
realizing.  Their eyes meet.

          Montgomery, Cortez, and Slutnik.
          Lieutenant England is your senior
          officer.

Jordan rolls her eyes:  At least two of the guys in her
crew are blue-ribbon misogynists.  Cortez and Slutnik
don't like it any better.

Flea checks on Jordan.  She paddles hard, really digging

Jordan catches the grin, gives one back.

look.  "Sorry, but..."

underground for the night.  How the hell did she wind up
here?  So far from home?

</b>          You're guaranteeing that?

Royce frowns:  He thought he was alone.  He tracks the
voices to a forced-air vent beside the chaise.

<b>                         VOICE #1
</b>          I have it on unorthodox but reliable
          authority that combat positions will
          remain off-limits.  Despite what's
          happening with our Babe in Boyland.

Alarms go off in Royce's head.  He moves quickly to a
railing, looks down.

ROYCE'S POV:  Of two naval officers on the floor below.
They stand beside a matching vent.  It's impossible to see
faces from this angle -- but one man has a distinct bald
spot.

<b>                         NAVAL OFFICER (VOICE #1)
</b>          Well, isn't that what these test
          cases are supposed to decide?
                  (thinking)
          Unless, of course, you're suggesting
          that "G.I. Jane" is on her way to
          becoming "Jane Doe"...

<b>                         BALD SPOT (VOICE #2)
</b>          All I'm saying is that we won't be
          integrating -- despite the rhetoric
          coming off Capitol Hill, despite
          what's happening in Coronado.  And
          you did not hear it from me.

<b>                         NAVAL OFFICER (VOICE #1)
</b>          Hear what?

A conspiratorial handshake.  The men split up.


<b>INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Royce flashes down the stairs.  Hitting main floor, he
looks around and then bumps into...

<b>                         DIAL-A-DATE
</b>          There you are.  Can we please dance
          now?

Over her shoulder, Royce spies Bald Spot heading for the

Royce bobs and weaves through the crowd, trying to keep

Bald Spot.  Pushing through the exit doors.

Only steps behind, Royce shoulders through the doors...

And blasts outside, intending to shake some answers out of
Bald Spot.  But here Royce finds...

A dozen naval officers waiting for their cars.  All of
them now wear caps.

Royce tries to check faces of the quickly departing men.
but it could have been anyone.

<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
A high-speed transport ("Seafox") is SLAMMING OVER SWELLS.
Lashed to one side is a rubber life boat.


<b>EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY
</b>
<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Crew Six!  Stand by!

          Slutnik!  In that order!  Five-
          second intervals!  Let's go!

England's crew lines up for cast-and-recover drills:  One
by one, they speed-roll off the transport...

... and drop into the life boat.  After quickly
stabilizing, they roll off the life boat...

... and disappear underwater like human bullets.  England
is last to cast off.


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
Jordan resurfaces.  Treading water, she scans for...

Seafox.  It makes a hard turn in the water and starts
back.  The recovery rig -- a big flexible loop -- is
lowered into position.

Still hauling ass, Seafox picks up the trainees in reverse
order -- England, Slutnik, Cortez.  They each stab an arm
through the passing loop...


<b>EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY
</b>
... and vault back aboard, slick as hell.

<b>                         CORTEZ
</b>          Hoo-yah!  Better'n sex in a car
          crash!

But now they're bearing down fast on...


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
Jordan.  She braces as best she can.  As SEAFOX THUNDERS
past, she stabs for the loop...

And snags it with her hand.  But only her hand.

Hanging on grimly, Jordan drags face down in torrential
water.  Her mouth gropes for clean air but can't find it.
If she doesn't let go soon, she'll drown.


<b>EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY
</b>
At the stern, the Chief spots Jordan bobbing up in the
boat's wake.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>                  (to pilot)
          Next recovery!  Keep goin', keep
          goin'!


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
COUGHING up water, Jordan watches Seafox speed on toward
McCool and Flea.  They make textbook recoveries.  She's
the only one who couldn't cut it.


<b>INT.  WOMEN'S SHOWERS - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
Head hung, Jordan showers alone.

<b>                         THE CHIEF (O.S.)
</b>          You know, the Israelis...

Jordan recoils.  Christ, how long has he been there?  Just
standing in the doorway?

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          ... they tried women in the 1967
          War.  Female soldiers.

With forced calm, Jordan squeaks off the water and finds a
towel.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Permission to get dressed, sir?

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          It seems the men couldn't get used
          to the sight of women blown open and
          their viscera hanging from tree
          limbs.  Israeli men would linger
          over wounded females -- often to the
          detriment of the mission, often
          endangering their own lives.  They
          don't use women anymore.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>                  (moving closer)
          Sir, someone mentioned you received
          the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you
          got it for?

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          For pulling a 210-pound man out of a
          burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I see.  So when a man tries to
          rescue another man, he's a hero.
          But when he tries to rescue a woman,
          he's gone soft.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Could you have pulled that 210-pound
          man clear, lieutenant?

She can't say yes.  She wants to but can't.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Females in combat situations impact
          unit cohesion.  Men fight better
          without women around.  And that is
          an historical fact.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          It also seems like a problem with
          the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe
          you should be sniffing around their
          shower room instead.

She shoulders past.  The Chief gives her a few steps
before dropping his bomb:

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          England went out with a stress
          fracture.  That puts you in charge,
          lieutenant.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>                  (off-balance)
          McCool's that same rank.  We're both
          j.g.'s.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          You were commissioned one month
          earlier, which makes you the senior
          officer.
                  (passing her on his
                   way out)
          Remember.  There are no bad crews --
          only bad leaders.


<b>INT.  ARTILLERY RANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Trainees are getting familiar with M-60 machine guns,
firing SHORT BURST at downfield targets.

<b>                         CORTEZ
</b>                  (pissed)
          No operational experience, and now

          Unbelievable.

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          Suppose she'll wanna eat with us
          now...

Jordan overhears them BITCHING.  She steps up to an open
slot -- and proceeds to WAIL AWAY with her M-60, tracer
rounds blazing.  Her target vaporized, she keeps WAILING
madly, taking out Slutnik's target... then Cortez's...
then...

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
</b>          O'Neil... O'Neil... O'NEIL!

Finally she stops.

</b>          One burst, one body, O'Neil!  What
          the fuck you trying to do?  Spell

                  (to class)
          You are not infantry!  Your
          firepower is limited!  Excessive

Reloading, Jordan tosses a look at Slutnik and Cortez.
Ain't nobody bitchin' now.

Eating at a table with other women, Jordan turns to see
Blondell setting down her tray.

<b>                         BLONDELL
</b>          They take you away to San Clemente

          How come you're doing this?  I mean,

<b>                         BLONDELL
</b>          Just some of the women.


<b>EXT.  QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
Walking across the base:

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I don't know if there's any single
          reason.  But my father was Navy.
          And he had this old-time recruiting
          poster in his den.  It showed a girl
          trying on a sailor's uniform while
          saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man!
          I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10
          years old when I first saw it, and
          even then it felt wrong.  Made me
          mad.  And I don't think a month has
          gone by that I haven't thought about
          that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a
          man."

<b>                         BLONDELL
</b>          I've been accused of that wish.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          The woman I saw you with...

<b>                         BLONDELL
</b>          Just a friend.  We have friends,
          too, you know.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          But are there... I mean, how many...

<b>                         BLONDELL
</b>          More than you'd guess.  It's just
          that we don't hold coffee klatches.
          If more then three of us get
          together at any one time, the guys
          think it's some kind of uprising.

They laugh.

<b>                         BLONDELL
</b>          Sounds funny now, but it's really
          not.  We have to be careful.  The
          Navy still knows how to put on a
          witch-hunt.

Reaching the quarterdeck, they scan a message board.
Jordan finds a half-dozen phone slips for her.

The HELO PATTERS away.

An inky stillness overtakes the world.

Jordan activates a red-light beacon, sweeps it around,
revealing her position to...

Her crew.  Five black faces regroup around her.

towards...

A moonlit shoreline.  Half-mile ahead.

night-vision goggles.

NIGHT-VISION POV:  Sweeping the rocks.  Nothing at first.
Then two "hostiles" appear, patrolling the rocks.

Jordan motions "down."  Six faces sink from sight.

NIGHT-VISION/UNDERWATER POV:  Of the "hostile" patrol

They resurface.  On Jordan's cue, the crew sheds flippers
and begins scaling rocks.  They've made landfall.

MONTAGE:  Racing the coming sun, Jordan's crew builds
their hide-site... digging feverishly... filling sand
bags... telescoping open a roof pole, fanning out spars...
laying canvas roof panels into place... camouflaging the
panels... sprinkling sanitizing powder around the
perimeter to ward off animals.  INTERCUT WITH...

A snake slithering across the ground.  As it nears the

A knife whacks its head off.

Slutnik picks up the carcass, kicks dirt over the severed
head.  No trace.

waste to a zip-lock baggy, offers the pot.

<b>                         CORTEZ
</b>          Anyone?

Abruptly Jordan unzips, drops her pants, sticks the pot
under her.  It raises eyebrows:  It's a far cry from when
she was covering up in cold water.

They come out of the hide-site like atomic locusts,
splintering into three groups and laying down SUPPRESSIVE
FIRE as they blitz for...

The woodlands.

"Hostiles" FIRE and pursue.

Flea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath
him.  He goes down like a doped race horse.  Suddenly
exposed, another crew scrambles into daylight:  Flea ran
right over their hide-site.

Slutnik yanks Flea out, gets him back on his feet.


<b>EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Breathing like asthmatics, Jordan's crew regroups at the
link-up site just inside the woods.  Flea comes in
hobbling.  Badly.

like this.

As a helo pirouettes in midair.


<b>EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Jordan's crew lopes through the woods, searching for a
place to bring the helo down.  Right on their heels...

ARTILLERY SIMULATORS THUMP-THUMP-THUMP, illumination
GRENADES POP and flare.  This may not be war, but it'll do
until the real thing comes along.

toward it.


<b>EXT.  CLEARING IN WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Whirling smoke, the helo descends.  Jordan's crew breaks
early, trying to get there the instant it touches down.
But before they can...

An FAV crashes through the underbrush, M-60s BARKING in
the helo's direction.  The helo bounds away.

Jordan's crew tries to retreat -- but a second FAV cuts
them off.


<b>INT.  HELO - DAY

JORDAN'S POV:  Brush slapping her face.

Crew Six is being hauled through the woods, hands tied
back, boots around their necks, pulled along by...

The captors.  We assume they're instructors in camouflage
paint -- but we're moving so fast it's impossible to be
sure.


<b>EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

A P.O.W. camp, disturbingly authentic.  A dozen trainees
are already here, held in pens of bamboo and barbed-wire.

Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry -- all five get
tossed into a pen.  Jordan is pulled away.

Jordan is thrown to the ground.  Her eyes go wide when she
sees a row of steel boxes nearby.  They're scarcely larger
then coffins.

Hands push Jordan inside the box.  She has to curl up
fetally just to fit.

          Please, HOW LONG?

The LID BANGS closed.  A LOCK RATCHETS, FOOTSTEPS RETREAT.
Daylight sheets in through ventilation slats.

When her eyes adjust, Jordan finds markings on the lid and
walls.  Scratchings made with a nail.  The memoirs of
previous tenants.

Anything to get her mind off this box.  Out of this box.
Now INTERCUT Jordan and Wickwire, lying like fraternal
twins in their wombs of steel:

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          One time he was doing a rekkie of
          the Libyan coastline.  This is,
          like, right before we bombed
          Khadaffi into the past tense.  So
          his crew does a nighttime infil,
          maps all the big artillery
          placements and stuff, then turns
          around to get the hell gone.  But
          between them and the water are five
          Libyan guards, all armed to the
          nuts.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          They had to kill 'em?

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But
          on every guard's chest,they left one
          Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little
          calling card to say they'd been
          there -- and could come back any
          time they wanted.

<b>                         JORDAN

</b>          So the shit you gotta go through?
          To get from here to there?  Brother

Reading as he walks, a former CIA spook looks up to find
Royce in lockstep.  It surprises him:  Not many people
here talk to him -- unless they're in trouble.  THE SPOOK
is physically unremarkable except for a face that would be

<b>INT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY
</b>
JORDAN'S POV:  The box opening.  Daylight assaulting us,
blowing out our eyes.  Disembodied hands pulling us out.


<b>EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
</b>
Legs hobbled, uniform soiled, Jordan is led past a row of
huts.  She looks like she got hit by a train -- and got
back up.

JORDAN'S POV:  Vision still blown out.  But inside the
pen, we make out 40 trainees now.  One guy wrings out a
sock and drinks from it.

Jordan moves past huts.  VOLATILE VOICES spill out as
trainees get interrogated.

JORDAN'S POV:  Outside one hut, we see Flea.  At least we
think it's him:  Strapped face-down to a table, sobbing
quietly, he wears a slinky dress and whore's makeup.  They
broke him -- and it's an ugly, ugly sight.


<b>INT.  INTERROGATION HUT - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY
</b>
<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          What is your father's name?

Jordan seated.  Prowling the hut is her interrogator.  Her
tormentor.  Her chaperon through Hell.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Simple question, lieutenant.  No
          reason not to answer.  What is your
          father's name?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          "Dad."

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Any brothers?  Sisters?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Dick, Jane, and Spot.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Are you hungry?  What's your
          favorite food?  We'll try to get it
          for you.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not
          going to get anywhere.  You might as
          well put me in the cage.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right
          here, right now.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Should I be afraid?

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Right down to your worthless womb,
          and I'll tell you why.  This is my
          island.  My world.  And here I can
          get away with shit that would get me
          arrested anywhere else in the world.
          Take another scan of my little joy-
          boy outside.  If I can do that to a
          Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to
          you?  Huh?

It makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid.
Continuing the psychological strip-search:

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Why didn't you shoot the woman,
          O'Neil?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Wasn't deemed a threat.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          She led us right to you.  That's no
          threat?

Jordan rubs her head.  So long ago.  How did the call come
down?

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Would you have shot if it was a man?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          The others already told me, O'Neil.
          They wanted to shoot, but you
          wouldn't let them.  Because you went
          soft on another women --

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          That's not right.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          That's what your crew said.  Are
          they lying?  Or are you?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I think you're the liar.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          I'm not the one who got five good
          men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You
          wear the bars, you made the call,
          and you got your whole crew --

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          We didn't know we were compromised.
          Firing would only've given away our
          position.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          You think we should go easy on
          women, O'Neil?

She stares a beat, knowing it's a loaded question.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Do you?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          No.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          I'm so glad we agree.

With stunning ferocity, he grabs her by the neck, pushes
her out the door...


<b>EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
</b>
... and throws her onto a table.

In the pens, all faces turn to watch.  Even instructors
stop what they're doing as...

The Chief pushes Jordan's head down and jams up behind
her.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Didn't you know you'd be raped if
          you were captured?  Didn't you even
          think about that?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Sure.  Just like your men do.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          I think we oughtta practice it,
          just so you know what to expect.

He flips her over, rips off her belt, starts tearing open
her pants.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Should I practice bleeding, too,
          sir?  Would that make me a better
          soldier?

He covers her mouth -- her whole face -- with one hand.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>                  (to the men)
          Any of you can stop this!  Just give
          me the location of one more hide-
          site, and it ends right here!

In the pen:

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>                  (wide-eyed)
          Someone's trippin' out here...

The Chief jerks Jordan up, whirls her around like a dead
dance partner, slams her face-first into the pen to give
the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty
face.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Three crews are still on this island
          somewhere.  Who knows where?

The men trade itchy looks.  Some do know.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Don't do it, don't do it...

The Chief throws her down like garbage.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Who's gonna tell me?  Who's gonna be
          chivalrous and stop this abuse?
          What, you want to see her get
          mauled?  Is that it?

The men shift anxiously.  Should they talk?  Behind the
Chief, Jordan staggers to her feet.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Don't tell him shi --

The Chief whirls, decks her a crescent-kick.  Instructors
lurch forward instinctively.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>                  (waving them back)
          She's fine!
                  (squatting beside)
          When I put you down, O'Neil, take
          the hint and stay down.

She licks her bloody teeth -- and considers kicking his
balls into his brainpan.  Instead she makes a move to get
up.  He grinds her back down with a crowbar forearm.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>                  (for her ears only)
          I am saving your life, O'Neil.  You
          may not know it, but I do.  You're
          an inferior soldier, a bad officer,
          and I don't want you learning that
          inconvenient truth when you're stuck
          in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy
          lines and don't know how the fuck to
          get out.  You get out now, O'Neil.
          Seek life elsewhere.  And if you
          can't do it in front of me, do it
          behind my back.

Pinning her down with just his eyes, he rises -- and
starts away.

Behind him, Jordan struggles to rise.

An ANXIOUS MURMUR races through the men:  They don't want
to see this.  They don't want to see her crucified.

<b>                         MCCOOL
</b>          Down... stay down...

Hearing, the Chief turns back to see...

Jordan wobbling to her feet.

Eye-lock.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Fuck you and the boat you rode in
          on.  Sir.

TIGHT on the faces of her crewmates -- Slutnik, Cortez,
McCool.  In their eyes, a new respect.  The Chief see it.
Instructors see it.  Everyone does.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>                  (to instructors)
          We're done here.

Beaten, he walks right out of camp.

Wordless, instructors open the pens, unlock the boxes.
Wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight.  But this time
he made it.

A medic tries to help Jordan, but she pushes him away,
walking drunkenly for...

Flea.  She begins wiping the makeup from his face.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Make you a deal, Flea.  Never tell
          me how I look -- and I'll never tell
          you.


<b>EXT.  PIERS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - SUNSET

The Chief chucks gear onto a transport boat.  FOOTSTEPS
approach.  He knows it's Pyro.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          You don't think she'd be raped if
          she were captured?  You don't think
          the threat of rape would be used to
          leverage the men?

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          You broke a dozen training rules
          back there -- before I lost count.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          I've had it.  Just because they pay
          me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean
          I'm gonna be one.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          She's a trainee, just like the
          others.  Why are you coming down so
          hard?

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          She's an officer.  There's a higher
          standard.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          She's a women, and that's why you're
          ridin' her bareback.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay
          on her until everyone realizes this
          is not some bullshit equal-rights
          thing, that real lives are gonna be
          lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.

<b>                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
</b>          I oughtta report you.

<b>                         THE CHIEF

          didn't know I was right.

<b>                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
</b>          Not that.  The White House just

          legislation that would, in one
          stroke, void all remaining elements
          of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.

The phone suddenly weights a ton, DeHaven dumps it on the
seat beside her.  HOLD on her disbelieving face.

window that offers a stunning view of Arlington National
Cemetery.

Jordan exits with purchases.  Her face is still bruised
from S.E.R.E.  With a minute to kill, she peruses a
bulletin board casually.  But a RAISED VOICE leads her
eyes to...

Wickwire.  At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically.  He
looks flustered when he spots Jordan.

<b>                         JORDAN

Jordan enters.  The yeoman's desk is unattended.  Noticing
the X.O.'s door open, Jordan peers inside to find...

Blondell.  She looks scared out of her mind.  Before she
and Jordan can speak, the yeoman materializes.

<b>                         YEOMAN
</b>          This way, lieutenant.  They're
          expecting you.


<b>INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          See me, sir?

The C.O. and X.O. are both here.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>                  (uncomfortable)
          I don't know of any delicate way to
          say this, lieutenant, so I won't
          try.  Claims have been made that you
          have engaged in fraternization -- of
          the same-sex variety.  Specifically,
          that you were...
                  (reading)
          "... seen leaving the apartment of
          another female officer at such a
          time and in such a manner as to
          suggest conduct unbecoming."

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>                  (a beat,laughing in
                   relief)
          Sir, if someone is suggesting that
          I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.

The C.O.'s face remains grim.  He isn't relieved.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          They're very wrong.  And I'd like to
          know where you got this information.

On the C.O.'s nod, the X.O. opens an adjoining office.
Wickwire enters.  He's stiff as a groom on a wedding cake.

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>          I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class
          officer, it's my obligation to
          report all violations.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          This is insane.  You've got no
          proof.

<b>                         X.O.
</b>                  (from report)
          You were seen leaving Ensign
          Blondell's apartment at
          approximately 0-200, whereupon
          physical affections were exchanged
          in public.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          We hugged.

<b>                         X.O.
</b>          In addition, you have been seen
          frequenting the base exchange, the
          mess hall, the --

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Because the men didn't want me
          eating with them.  Jesus Christ,
          let's get this right.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          That's enough.  Everybody.
                  (to Wickwire)
          Rejoin your class, lieutenant.

<b>                         WICKWIRE
</b>                  (only to Jordan)
          I wish I didn't have to do this,
          Jordan.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Dismissed, lieutenant.

Wickwire exits.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Sir, I just want you to know that
          this is either a gross mistake --
          or someone's vindictive bullshit.
          In no way did anything happen
          between Ensign Blondell and myself.
          We're just friends.

<b>                         X.O.
</b>          So you're saying the charges have no
          validity whatsoever?

Jordan opens her mouth to confirm -- and hesitates,
realizing where this might be headed.  What the collateral
damage might be.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I'm saying, we're just friends.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          I find this as distasteful as you,
          lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk,
          it's on my shoulders.  There's going
          to be an inquiry -- it will not be
          quick and it will definitely not be
          pretty.  You should prepare
          yourself.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Sir, please... if there's any way to
          do this without dragging everyone
          through the mud...

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.

Jordan moves to the door.  Again she makes eye-contact
with Blondell.  Now we understand why she's so scared:
There's a witch-hunt brewing.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>                  (turning back)
          Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under
          your command... would the inquiry
          still go forward?

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          I'm not sure what --

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Would you have the discretion to end
          it right then and there?

She's offering her own head on a silver platter -- and the
C.O. actually hesitates before answering.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          I believe so.


<b>EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

McCool and Flea exit a classroom with other trainees.
They spot Jordan approaching.

<b>                         MCCOOL
</b>          So what'd he want?  O'Neil?

She passes them robotically.  Flea realizes where she's
going.

<b>                         FLEA
</b>          Oh, no... no, no, no, no...

They lurch after her, grabbing her, stepping in her way.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Stand fast!

McCool and Flea jerk to a stop:  The Chief has emerged
from the instructor's office.  Helpless, they watch as...

Jordan mounts the stairs to the bell... takes up the
baton... and HITS THE BELL like a tyko drummer.

RING ONE:  On the pained faces of her crewmates.

RING TWO:  On the Chief.  Taking no joy in it.  Just
accepting it as inevitable.


<b>EXT.  THE QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
RING THREE:  On Wickwire as he walks across the base.  His
regrets are obvious.

<b>                                            FADE OUT.

<b>FADE IN:

<b>EXT.  UPRIVER - THE POTOMAC - DAY
</b>
The ice floes are gone.  The river banks are budding
green.  Soon CAMERA FINDS a power boat making its way
upriver.  A lone figure sits on the prow.


<b>EXT.  POWER BOAT - DAY
</b>
It's Jordan.  Dressed in civvies, gunnysack between her
legs, she's back in Virginia with nothing more than what
she left with.  Around a river bend appears...

The gunkhole harbor.  Home.


<b>EXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - DAY
</b>
The boat docks.  Jordan springs clear, waves a worn-out
thanks, starts up the dock.  But now she comes to a stop,
seeing...

Royce.  Stepping out of the house.

EXTREMELY WIDE:  River shimmering behind them, they meet
on the dock.  A charged stand-off:  Where do they pick up?
Can they pick up?  Then Jordan drops her gunnysack and
steps into his wide-spread arms.  Royce wraps her up as if
to never let go.

For the first time in this whole ordeal, Jordan begins
crying, sobbing uncontrollably.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>                  (in her ear)
          I want to kill them... I want to
          kill the guys who made you cry like
          this...


<b>INT.  COVERED PORCH - JORDAN'S HOUSE - SUNSET

An hour later.  Sharing a quiet moment, Jordan and Royce
cradle tea mugs while sitting on the rear porch that
overlooks the Potomac and a fiery sunset.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          All I wanted was an honest chance.
          And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't
          stay.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          And this class officer...
          "Wickwire."  You think he was just
          trying to get even?  Striking back
          for...

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like
          he was getting any satisfaction out
          of it.  Almost like...
                  (a beat)
          Did I say he was class officer?

<b>                         ROYCE

</b>          No shortage of suspects.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          The Chief?  Or maybe even
          Turrentine?  Your C.O.?

She looks at him sidelong.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Royce.  Tell me you didn't keep a
          file on me.


<b>INT.  LIVING ROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
CLOSE on multiple files being pulled out of a briefcase.
One contains clippings -- "G.I. Jane" photos, editorials,
political cartoons.  Another holds records of Coronado
personnel -- Jordan's crewmates, instructors, the base
brass.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Somebody was yankin' your stings,
          Jordan -- maybe from 3,000 miles
          away.  I wanted to know who.  I still
          do.

She shakes her head, resisting.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with
          me.

<b>                         JORDAN

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Someone screwed you over like this,
          left unanswered charges hanging over
          your head, and you're not gonna
          fight back?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I'm tired of fighting back.  I just
          wanted to come home and be safe and
          have you here and the river there
          and just forget the rest of the
          world, okay?

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Well, before you crawl off to die,
          Jordan, give me five minutes of good
          headwork.

Agitated, she walks away.  B.G., a PHONE RINGS until the
machine picks up.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          What about him.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Instructors typically pull three
          year assignments.  This guy's in and

          sound right?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Sounds like an amazing coincidence.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Or like maybe he was baby sitting a
          problem child for the Navy.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I don't know, I don't care.

<b>                         ROYCE
</b>          Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who
          else?  Who could've leveraged a
          class officer like that?  C'mon,
          Jordan, keep your head in the game.

UNDER DIALOG, we hear some of the INCOMING CALL:

<b>                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)

          you need to reach us, we're here in

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          DeHaven...

Now she looks up to behold...

Jordan standing in the gallery.  Staring down on DeHaven
as she is, it's hard to read anything into her expression
but open disdain.

Drawn by Jordan's voice, a CAPITOL GUARD hurries down the
gallery steps.  Royce runs interference.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          We can talk here or we can talk
          outside, Senator.  You tell me.

On the floor, half the U.S. Senate stops what it's doing
and looks up.

In the gallery, the guard is thrown off-balance by the
naval uniforms:  Do Royce and Jordan belong here or not?
Confused, he looks for guidance from...

DeHaven.  She notes C-SPAN cameras swinging Jordan's way.
Summoning a page:

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Cloak room.  I'll meet her there.
          Just her.


<b>INT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</b>
Towering doors swing open.  DeHaven appears, face pleasant
but harried.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get
          together -- though just now I'm
          gearing up for a child-care vote
          that --

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

About to hug Jordan, DeHaven stops awkwardly.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          You know him.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Sounds familiar.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          It should.  You nominated him for
          Spec-Recon just three days after you
          nominated me.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch
          tomorrow?  I do very much want to
          talk, but now is scarcely --

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Did you set me up?  Did you set me
          up just to see me fail?

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Absolutely not.

DeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber --
the open doors.  Walking Jordan a few steps away:

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Wickwire was there to help.  To be
          my eyes on the inside, to make sure
          you were getting a fair shot.  At
          least that was the intent.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          What changed?

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Should probably ask him that.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          If I have to ask again, Senator,
          I'll be asking in front of cameras.

It's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate.  The Senate
DOORKEEPER appears.

<b>                         DOORKEEPER
</b>          Madam Senator?  Your esteemed
          colleagues are requesting --

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Two seconds, Walter.
                  (answering Jordan)
          In 1981, the Supreme Court was
          asked to rule on the issue of women
          in combat positions.  The Court
          cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
          as a legal foundation for keeping
          women ineligible.  That decision
          held for all these years -- until
          the White House, 10 days ago, moved
          to have the Exclusion Laws voided.
          To demolish that legal foundation.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          So?  Isn't the President jumping on
          your bandwagon?

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          What he did was light the bandwagon
          on fire.  Because he knows what I
          know -- that American families are
          not prepared to put their daughters
          in harm's way.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          You don't know that.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          In face, I do:  Roper, Harris,
          Gallop -- they all come back the
          same.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          What are you saying?  That a women's
          life is more valuable than a man's?
          That a women's death hurts a family
          more?

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          I'm saying it's not going to happen.
          Not when the President is set to
          turn this into a third-rail issue
          should I choose to ever campaign
          against him.  He will fry me six
          ways to Sunday for sending daughters
          and young mothers off to war -- and,
          quite possibly, for bringing them
          back in body bags.

Jordan shakes her head in disbelief.  She has met the
enemy -- and she is us.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          You were never going to let women
          serve in combat.  You always had a
          safety net.  Or thought you did.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully
          understand this -- but sometimes
          there's more to be gained from the
          fight than the victory.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          So the rhetoric gets you headlines.
          But the reality gets you in trouble.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          The reality is this:  We send far
          too many men off to war.  I don't
          need to compound the problem with
          women.
                  (off Jordan's look)
          Can you honestly tell me you wanted
          that life?  Squat-pissing in some
          third-world jungle with --

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I wanted the choice.  The chance to
          prove myself, my skills, my work,
          me.  That's how it should've been.

<b>                         DOORKEEPER
</b>          Madam Senator, once again I must --

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter.

Not happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove,
grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions.
He enters the chamber...


<b>INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</b>
... and moves behind the rostrum.  Holding the broom by
the bristles, the doorkeeper stands on tip-toes...

And uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by
three minutes.

Senators GROAN.  It's an old trick played by senior
members -- and they all hate it when it happens to them.


<b>INT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</b>
<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          I once promised you a fast ticket,
          Jordan, and I always meant to make
          good on that.  Come work for me.  I
          can always use a hard-charger on my
          team.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          You promise Wickwire a fast ticket,
          too?

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          I've had no direct communication
          with him since this whole thing
          began.  And that's quite verifiable.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          I'm sure it is.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          You'll think about my offer?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          You know, I wonder what the SecNav
          would think about it.  If I spoke
          with him.

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this
          morning myself -- and told him the
          deal was off.  No more test cases.
          He was only too happy to oblige.
                  (dangerously low)
          Don't play politics with me, little
          darlin'.  You'd be up way past your
          bedtime.

<b>                         DOORKEEPER
</b>                  (distraught)
          Madam Senator, please...

<b>                         DEHAVEN
</b>          I'll call you in a few days.

She flashes a winning smile and turns away.  As the
chamber doors start to close behind her:

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          So I wonder what the President would
          think.

The last image we have of DeHaven is her whirling back,
startled.  The DOORS BOOM CLOSED in her face.


<b>EXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
Through a window, we see the C.O. with a phone pressed to
his ear.  He stands at attention even though wearing a
bathrobe.  Half-audible through the glass:

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Yes sir.  No, I'm not saying it
          would be impossible, sir, just...
          Yes sir.  No sir.  Yes sir.  I can
          appreciate that, sir.  Good night,
          sir.


<b>INT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
</b>
The C.O. hangs up and looks to Jordan, heretofore unseen.
She waits anxiously.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Well, if you had to go over my
          head, lieutenant, that's the way to
          do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200
          call from the Commander and Chief to
          get the bowels movin'.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Sir?  What did he say?

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Basically -- he asked me if I could
          unring a bell.


<b>EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</b>
START on the helmet graveyard.  Hands enter FRAME to
reclaim one helmet in particular.  TILT UP on Jordan,
back in the grinder, back in Navy greens.

The Spec-Recon class is here.  Crewmates gawk like stone
idiots as Jordan takes her old place in the line-up.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>                  (to class)
          One of you here understands better
          than anyone what this is all about.
          Someone who has engaged in conduct
          unbecoming.  Someone who knows, I
          would hope, what he must now do.

CLOSE on Wickwire.  Feeling the heat.  Wondering if they
really know who it is.  Now the C.O. parks himself right
in Wickwire's face.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          And unless that someone takes the
          honorable way out in the next 10
          seconds -- I will make certain he
          faces action under the Uniform Code
          of Military Justice.

Wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell.  He slows
when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows
would be inadequate.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Just walk away and never stop.

He does.  As Wickwire RINGS OUT:

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          It seems we have an opening for
          class officer.  Any nominations?

Eyes swing to Jordan.  Way ahead of them:

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          All those in favor?

A CHORUS OF AYES.  Jordan puddles up.

<b>                         C.O.
</b>          Chief Urgayle, turning it back over
          to you.

On his way to the front, the Chief stops to check in with
Jordan.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Well, I'm trying to figure out if
          you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous
          -- or some new alloy of all three.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Good to see you again, too, sir.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed
          all the others.  Now try me.


<b>EXT.  CORONADO BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
The morning sun is an orange ball balanced on the Coronado
Bridge.  In silhouette, pelicans circle, some dive-bombing
into the bay below.  Suddenly a HELO HOWLS across the sun,
scattering the birds as it heads off-shore.


<b>INT.  HELO - DAY
</b>
<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>                  (setting watch)
          Four... three... two... one... hack!

Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry, Jordan.  Inside
the airborne helo, they synchronize their dive watches.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Final assignment!  Each crew will be
          dropped 12 miles out!  Between you
          and the shore is a network of mines
          and underwater obstacles!  You will
          clear the obstacles, you will tag
          the mines with your crew number!
          You have until 18-hundred to make
          landfall!


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
As the helo swoops down onto the ocean deck.


<b>INT.  HELO - DAY
</b>
The trainees double-check wet gear and survival vests.  On
Jordan's nod, they push an inflatable life boat ("ILB") to
the helo door.  It's rolled up into a rubber log.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Remember!  The one thing you can
          count on in any mission is that
          anything mechanical will fail!  If
          you get stuck out here, do not call
          me, for you will no longer be in my
          class!  Try the Coast Guard!

The HELO PILOT slows to five knots.  The Chief gives
Jordan the go-ahead nod.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>                  (to her crew)
          One-second intervals!  Go!


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
The ILB splashes down into the ocean.  Jordan's crew helo-
casts in after it.

From the door of the circling helo, the Chief watches
as...

Jordan's crew swims to the ILB, bobbing in the swells.
Flea turns a handle on the CO2 tank meant to inflate the
boat.  Nothing happens.

<b>                         FLEA
</b>          C'mon, c'mon...

Cortez tries to help.  The handle spins in his grip.

<b>                         CORTEZ
</b>          This tank's not gonna cut it, el-
          tee.  Handle's stripped.

Jordan looks skyward.  100 feet overhead, the Chief gives
her a parting salute as the helo lifts away.

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          I just wonder how that happened.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Cortez, see if you can dig out the
          tools without losing the rest of out
          gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.


<b>INT.  HELO - DAY
</b>
The helo turns into the morning sun.  PILOT and CO-PILOT
drop visors.

PILOT'S POV:  Of dots in the sun.  What the hell are try?

SMACK!  Something hits the windscreen, splattering red and
brown.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          What happening?!

<b>                         PILOT
</b>          Fucking pelicans!  Hang on!

He starts to bank clear -- but not fast enough.


<b>EXT.  HELO - DAY
</b>
More birds pepper-shot the helo:  One SHREDS through the
main rotor, another through the tail rotor.  Another bird
gets sucked right into...

The main turbine.


<b>INT.  HELO - DAY
</b>
A SHARP BANG... a WICKED SHIMMY... and now they whole helo
loses power.

<b>                         PILOT
</b>          Holy... LET'S GYRATE!

As the pilot wrestles controls, the co-pilot rigs for
auto-gyration.  But the bank they started is working
against them:  The helo is coming down badly, circling
like a huge steel feather.

Braced, the Chief looks out the side door -- and sees
ocean rushing up at him.  Fast.


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
<b>                         MCCOOL
</b>          What the shit is...

Jordan whirls.  She's just in time to witness...

The helo hitting the water.  In seconds it's gone.

A stunned beat.  We never knew the ocean could be this
quiet.  When the anesthetic of shock wears off:

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          You don't suppose this is just part
          of...

<b>                         JORDAN
</b><b>          FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT!
</b>          Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the
          hell you waiting for?

Cortez torques his wrench hard:  CO2 flows into the ILB,
inflating it.  The crew scrambles aboard.  Jordan digs
like a dog to find a radio.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  We
          have a downed helo 12 miles west-
          south west of base with three
          aboard.  Repeat, we have a downed
          helo with three aboard...

Slutnik yanks a starter cord:  Their outboard MOTOR ROARS
to life.  The boat does a donut in the water and blasts
away.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
The ILB powers over swells.  Flea is perched on the bow,
nose to the wind like a hunting dog.

<b>                         FLEA
</b><b>          CUT IT!  CUT IT HERE!
</b>
Slutnik motors down.

<b>                         FLEA
</b>          Close as I can get, el-tee!

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take
          your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!

They grab masks and mini-tanks and dive in like dolphins.
Jordan snaps up the radio.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  What
          is your E.T.A. on that rescue helo?
          Over.

<b>                         BASE (V.O.)
</b>          Crew Leader, we have a Medevac
          rerouting from Long Beach, but no
          other helos prepped at this time.
          Seafox One and Two are launching
          now.  Over.

A beat.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Base, don't think you copied me.  We
          are 12 miles out.  Seafox tops out
          at 30 knots, which makes it a no-
          show for 18 minutes.  Over.

<b>                         BASE (V.O.)
</b>          You copied right, Crew Leader.
          We're looking for options ourselves.

<b>                         SLUTNIK
</b>          Maybe we should call the Coast
          Guard.

A grim beat -- and then A CRACKLE on the radio.  With a
voice seemingly from the far side of the moon:

50 feet down, the helo lies canted on a reef shelf.


<b>INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
Wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment,
we find the Chief, operating out of an air-pocket near the
windscreen.  The pilot is dead, impaled on his cyclic
stick, head submerged.  The co-pilot is still alive,
barely.  The Chief struggles to keep the man's head up as
he keys a survival radio.

<b>                         THE CHIEF

<b>                         THE CHIEF (V.O.)

          they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make
          sure they send a helo with a winch

          aboard?  And can you get at it?
          Over.


<b>EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
The Chief props up the co-pilot's head.  Gulps air.  Ducks
underwater to grope through wreckage.  Only now do we see
that "questionable leg" he was talking about:  It's
snapped at mid-calf, blood rivering out.


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
<b>                         THE CHIEF (V.O.)

<b>EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
Again the Chief goes below water.  He finds a small breach
in the fuselage... sticks the flare launcher through...
and pulls the trigger.

With a MAGNESIUM FLASH, the flare launches...


<b>EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
... streaks toward the surface...


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
... and arcs into daylight 50 yards behind the ILB.

<b>                         FLEA

          down with a tank -- just something

An ominous beat.

          main tanks.

<b>                         MCCOOL
</b>          What?

They scramble to check their main dive tanks.  Even
through the gauges show full, they're dead empty.  All of
them.

<b>                         THE CHIEF

          This mission wasn't about tagging

He laughs.  It's the bleakest laugh imaginable.

Jordan surveys the equipment they do have aboard -- the
stuff she can count on.  Mental turbos kicking in:

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          So we got two full mini-tanks, three
          minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air
          in yours?

<b>                         MCCOOL
</b>          Maybe half.  Not even.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Grab an oar, find a way to weight it
          down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez,
          help him.  Flea?  You take one of the
          two full minis -- and just follow my
          lead.

          O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as
          soon as we get down there.  You know
          that, don't you?

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          So I guess we get one shot at it.


<b>INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Swimming in his own blood, the Chief starts to fade away,
losing consciousness.  But then, through the cockpit
windscreen...

A hazy orb of light above him.  The orb grows and grows
until it resolves into a flare carried by his would-be
savior.  Jordan.

<b>                         THE CHIEF
</b>          Why'd it have to be her...


<b>EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
Reaching the downed Helo, McCool and Cortez wedge their
oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until...

An opening appears.

Jordan and Flea swim into the breach...


<b>INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
... and surface inside the wreckage.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Chief, sir... still with me?

<b>                         CHIEF

          Take him first.  Once he's clear,
          come back with --

<b>                         JORDAN

          we're all getting out of here.  Now
          how's your vest check out?  Still
          good?


<b>EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
McCool's air craps out.  He abandons his oar and swims for
the surface.  That leaves only...

Cortez, struggling mightily to keep the escape route open.
He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it
scares the bejeezus out of him.


<b>INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed
          him air.  Chief, sir, you and I are
          gonna take the express elevator
          outta here.  Remember to let your
          air out.  Ready?


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Twin transports -- Seafox One and Two -- pound across the
water.  Instructors sweep binoculars, trying to spot...

The ILB.  Newberry POPS A FLARE skyward as Slutnik

<b>EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Cortez's air goes dead.  He gives it three more seconds,
eyes riveted on the underside of the helo, knowing they
have to come out... right... fucking... absolutely...

NOW:  Jordan appears with the Chief.  Flea is at their
heels with the co-pilot.

Cortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims
for the sky.

The HELO BOOMS back down onto the reef.

Jordan yanks the cord on the Chief's vest.  It inflates
instantly.  One arm raised, Jordan streaks for the
surface...


<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
</b>
... and "Supermans" into daylight with the Chief.  They
covered 50 feet in four seconds.

Doing a 360, Jordan spots...

Seafox One coming their way.

Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim.

Not slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place:
They're wasting no time on the pick-up.

Remembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a
death-grip on the Chief's vest.

<b>                         THE CHIEF

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>          Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.

The recovery loop comes at her like a big brass ring.

SEAFOX THUNDERS past.  Jordan plunges her free arm through
the loop...

And suddenly they're gone, whisked away by the boat.

Throwing a rooster tail a mile long, Seafox pivots on the
water and heads back to base.

All buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites,
the former trainees erupt with ONE GREAT HOO-YAH.  What
began as a class of 100 now ends with just 40.

Sitting among the families and friends we find Royce,
smiling through his fears.  Not far away sits Blondell.
No one claps louder.

Jordan trades high-fives and fierce hugs with crewmates.
Pyro finally manages to take her aside.
