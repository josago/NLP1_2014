15   OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15
     WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until
     finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...

<b>     FADE IN:
</b>
<b>     EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK
</b>
     The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
     just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
     water runs down its face and body.

     TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the
     baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
     her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
     baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:

<b>                                 MIDWIFE
</b>                He is strong.

     The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out
     to the new MOTHER:

     AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
     divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
     takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
     She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:

<b>                                 AMANDA
</b>                ... hello.

     CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
     She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:

<b>                              YOUNGER MIDWIFE
</b>                The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?

<b>                              MIDWIFE
</b>                        (a beat; then)
                She is human.

     A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
     into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
     that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.

<b>                                 MIDWIFE (CONT'D)
</b>                Sarek arrives.

     The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for
     a moment, clearly disquieted.

</b>
      A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities
      constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the
      mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the
      horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built
      seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.

<b>      A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.

      The speeder parks outside the home --

<b>15C   EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK                                           15C
</b>
      SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the
      rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He
      looks at the child -- his child -- and says:

<b>                                  SAREK
</b>                 Well done.

      She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just
      enough rancor:

<b>                                  AMANDA
</b>                 Thanks.

      He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE --

<b>                               SAREK
</b>                 Your tone suggests disappointment. The
                 Science Council required my presence for
                 a session regarding--

<b>                                  AMANDA
</b>                 Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you
                 here.

      The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.
      The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a
      small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,
      clinically:

<b>                               SAREK
</b>                 As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
                 traditionally not present at the moment
                 of delivery.

<b>                                AMANDA
</b>                 Well traditionally, I'm not the one
                 giving birth.
                         (then)
<b>                                (MORE)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                               3
</b><b>15C   CONTINUED:                                                        15C
</b><b>                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)
</b>                   I moved here -- to another planet -- to
                   be with you. I needed you to be with me
                   today. Holding my hand and telling me
                   I'm doing great, even when I'm just...
                   breathing the best I can.

      Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at
      the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers
      this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:

<b>                                 SAREK
</b>                   You are correct. I should have been
                   here. I am sorry.

      And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
      him. And the two look at the baby.

<b>                                 SAREK (CONT'D)
</b>                   I had a thought. That we might name the
                   child after one of our respected early
                   society-builders. His name was "Spock".

      She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.

<b>                                 SAREK (CONT'D)
</b>                   Your silence does not suggest enormous
                   enthusiasm.

<b>                                  AMANDA
</b>                   No... Spock.
                           (smiles, touches his
                            face)
                   ... Spock.

      She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.

<b>                                 SAREK
</b>                   The child has your eyes.

      She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She
      gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
      revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.

<b>                                 AMANDA
</b>                   ... and your ears.

      And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
      we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM
      SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS
      -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS
      OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:

      With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and

      SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a
      flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on
      the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:

<b>                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
</b>                 Report.

      -- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face,
      swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:

<b>                               FIRST OFFICER

      Robau moves to Pitts:

<b>                               OFFICER PITTS

      Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they
      approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA --
      ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:

      whom we'll come to know as AYEL:

                   ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal
                   would be unwise.

      Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them.      A
      tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer:

      Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes,
      knowing what this means. Finally:

      All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair.
      Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain:

      In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors --
      his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW-
      PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD --

      Robau enters a shuttle -- LIGHTS BLINK to life.   He moves to the

      Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes
      on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS
      of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He
      realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as:

<b>                               OFFICER PITTS

      Two MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS on the Kelvin's dish GO HOT -- and turn,
      FLARING out the lens -- landing on the SHUTTLE as it leaves the
      KELVIN, heading toward the imposing Narada.

      he moves for the darkened ship -- nerves --

      Robau watches as he gets closer, the BEEPBEEPING HEARD over the
      SOUNDS of the shuttle -- but then --

<b>26FB EXT. NARADA - SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                26FB
</b>
      ALL WE HEAR IS THE LOW-PITCHED BEEPBEEP as the small shuttle
      seems to get swallowed up by the massive forward-facing spires
      of the Narada -- the distant floodlights creating EERIE SHADOWS
      everywhere. A gigantic IRIS DOOR TURNS, SLOWLY OPENS -- and the
      shuttle enters the Narada's main HANGAR -- the door CLOSES --

<b>26FC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26FC

      And everyone is just motionless and silent. Only Robau's VITAL
      SIGNS can be HEARD, BEEPING away. George's eyes glued ahead --

<b>26G   INT. SHUTTLE/NARADA HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                        26G
</b>
      TIGHT ON ROBAU as he faces the shuttle door, considering his
      fate. Finally the SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS -- standing there are
      eight ROMULAN GUARDS, brandishing WEAPONS. He steps down. They
      grab him, hard -- he's SCANNED -- FRISKED -- PULLED ALONG -- and
      we REVEAL the absolutely MASSIVE HANGAR, the insane architecture
      of the interior of this dark, wet, dripping ship --

      Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans
      at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as
      he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted
      and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A
      presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.

      Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
      Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we
      will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).

<b>                               AYEL
</b>                 Are you familiar with this craft?

      Robau regards it.   Then:

<b>                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
</b>                 Who is your commander?
                         (silence, then re: Nero)
                 Is it him?

<b>                               AYEL
</b>                 You will speak only to me.

<b>                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
</b>                 Then ask your commander what right he has
                 to attack a Federation vessel.

<b>                               AYEL
</b>                 That was hardly an attack. My commander
                 will easily destroy your ship. If you do
                 not respond to the question.

      Robau considers the hologram again.     And what his answer might
      mean for the fate of his crew.

<b>                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
</b>                 I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.

<b>                               AYEL
</b>                 Are you familiar with -- or better, know
                 the location of -- Ambassador Spock?

      Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING, ROTATING IMAGE
      OF SPOCK, who appears to be 75 earth-years old. The baby, born
      just three years earlier. Robau is as confused as we are...

<b>                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
</b>                 I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

<b>                               AYEL

                 stardate?

                  For marrying her.

     Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable --
     AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They
     land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2!
     The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure
     what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO:

     TIGHT ON Spock, chastened, sitting glumly on a bench. A massive
     VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents
     ARGUE at a distance down the hall:

<b>                 AMANDA                                SAREK

     - how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable
     -- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being

     -- I want him to embrace           above all.
     Vulcan, you know that... but
     he has to be himself-- which
     means, occasionally, being         -- His "humanity" is very the
     human.                             source of his ostracism.
     -- When Vulcans get disgusted
     with each other, they never
     just walk away, do they?           -- No.
     -- Well humans do.

     And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns --
     sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING
     IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in
     front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:

     After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his
     face. Takes a seat beside his son...

<b>                              SAREK

     Sarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady:

                   Cartography, mathematics-- what do these
                   mean? This date here -- eleven years
                   from now-- what happens then?

                   Federation space?

      Nero's face betrays nothing; no fear, no doubt. Cold as fucking
      ice.   The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book:
      A DRAWING OF SPOCK. He closes the book.

</b>                   When you were captured we assumed you
                   were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil
                   the Empire. But because the Romulans
                   deny your existence, I believe you are
                   much more than that.

      Interrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches
      with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP-
      FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is.

</b>                   Your ship remains in orbit above us now.
                   We've been asking for its secrets for too
                   long. That is why I am here. We want to
                   know how it works and I believe now,
                   finally... you will tell us.

      A Guard uses TONGS to pull out the most DISGUSTING creature
      you've seen from the container: a SLUG with SUCKERS and spikes,
      covered in a grimy muck -- it FLIP FLOPS.

</b>                   Centaurian slugs. Their native planet is
                   in constant sunlight. As a result,
                   there's nothing they hate more... than
                   darkness.

      A Guard GRABS NERO'S HEAD and FORCES IT BACK; the second PRIES
      HIS MOUTH OPEN with his hands.

      Another Guard SHOVES THE THING INTO NERO'S MOUTH -- Nero keeps
      his eyes open -- furiously determined not to be broken -- as
      they FORCE HIM TO SWALLOW IT -- he DOESN'T SCREAM as the
      wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his
      stomach --

                 of any dark space they're in.

      Nero stares at the ceiling in HORRIFYING INTERNAL PAIN -- but
      straining to block it out. PUSH DOWN on Nero's wide, crazed
      eyes -- TIGHTER as we SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO SEE WHAT HE'S SEEING --

      Quiet. A waiting area. AMANDA, Spock's mother, stands alone in
      a passageway. She looks off-camera to her son:

<b>                               AMANDA
</b>                 Spock, come here, let me see you.

                 No.

<b>                                   AMANDA
</b>                 Spock.

      Reluctantly, Spock walks into frame. She begins adjusting his
      collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying
      like hell to look impassive.

<b>                               AMANDA (CONT'D)
</b>                 There is no need to be so anxious.
                 You'll do fine.

<b>                               SPOCK
</b>                 I am hardly "anxious", mother.
                         (beat, then, anxiously)
                 And "fine" has variable definitions.
                 "Fine" is unacceptable.

      She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and    it
      annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with    his
      collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but   he
      doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between    them.

     She stares at him, moved.      Touches his face.

     An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before
     the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,
     seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.

<b>                                SCIENCE MINISTER
</b>                  You have surpassed the expectations of

                  flawless. With one exception. I see you
                  have applied to Starfleet as well.

<b>                                SPOCK

</b>                  Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
                  accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
                  A distinction all the more significant
                  given that you will be its first half-
                  human pupil. It is truly remarkable,
                  Spock. That you have achieved so much
                  despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
                  the Academy.

     They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled:

<b>                                SPOCK
</b>                  If you would clarify, Minister-- what

     As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same
     look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his
     father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.
     His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes
     the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --

     Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold:

</b>                  No Vulcan has ever declined admission to

<b>                                SPOCK

     commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can
     way--                                think of no greater way to
                                          honor our race than to attend
                                          Starfleet as its first Vulcan.

<b>                                 SCIENCE MINISTER
</b>                  Why did you come before this council
                  today? Was it to satisfy your emotional
                  need to rebel?

<b>                                SPOCK
</b>                  I came with the intention of enrolling,
                  as my father wished. However, your
                  "insight" has convinced me otherwise.
                  Therefore, the only emotion I wish to
                  convey is gratitude. Thank you,
                  Ministers, for your consideration.

     He looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident --
     still, God bless him, Spock walks out --

     JAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty,
     dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives
     him a look, then back to the bartender:

     Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - he's out of it, but
     won't give up. The Cadets UNLEASH on him and really PUMMEL HIM -
     - and Kirk's spirited, but LOSING -- about to LOSE BAD -- when
     an EAR-SPLITTING WHISTLE makes everything STOP -- they turn --
     standing in the doorway is a tall, rugged Starfleet officer --

     The cadets file out, in for it. Pike moves to a dazed, semi-
     conscious Kirk, now upside down on a table.

<b>                              PIKE (CONT'D)

                        (then, smiles)
                For my dissertation, I was assigned the
                U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about
                your dad... he didn't believe in no-win
                scenarios.

<b>                              KIRK
</b>                He sure learned his lesson.

                You're here, aren't you?
                        (off Kirk's look)
                That instinct to leap without looking--
                that was his nature, too. And in my
                opinion it's something Starfleet has
                lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
                overly-disciplined.

                Those cadets you took on, they'll make
                competent officers -- but you can bet
                your ass they'll run home to momma the
                minute they're looking down the barrel of

                drooling on the floor. Your aptitude
                tests were off the charts-- what is it,
                d'you like being the only Genius Level

     And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a
     nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-
     mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

     He's getting under Kirk's skin -- but Kirk keeps up the 'tude,
     grabs his jacket, stands --

     Eyes lock... and it's now Pike who stands and walks off.   And
     that's where it hangs. Off Kirk, brooding...

     Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE
     AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for
     an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the
     skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights. UNMISTAKABLY, THE
     U.S.S. ENTERPRISE. Unformed, raw, like its future captain. Our
     MUSIC SWELLS, we PUSH IN ON HIM, considering Pike's offer, his
     future, his fate.

     The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a
     shuttle -- and Pike, staring off, waiting. The PILOT
     approaches:

<b>                              SHUTTLE PILOT
</b>                Waiting for something, Cap?

<b>                               PIKE
</b>                ... No.   Guess not.

     He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running
     a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the
     viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:
     KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard --

<b>                              PIKE (CONT'D)
</b>                Hold her a second...

     Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike
     near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just
     the clothes on his back.

<b>                              SHIPYARD WORKER
</b>                Nice ride, man.

     Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard --

<b>                               KIRK
</b>                Live it up.

     Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.

<b>                               KIRK (CONT'D)
</b>                Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three.

     Pike grins as Kirk passes him.

     Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some
     of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK
     UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND.

     Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
     FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks
     like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:

<b>             FLIGHT OFFICER                          MAN

                                       Darlin', with no windows --

     sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying
     RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.'

     They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat
     beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
     armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:

      In MOONLIGHT, a beautiful WOMAN lies on her back, in some kind

     President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk
     MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping.

<b>                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
</b>                  Step forward please. This is Commander
                  Spock, one of our most distinguished
                  graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi
                  Maru test for the last four years.

     Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods.

<b>                                SPOCK
</b>                  Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow
                  managed to install and activate a sub-
                  routine in the programming code, thereby
                  changing the conditions of the test.

     We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.

<b>                                KIRK

<b>                                 KIRK
</b>                  Now let me ask you something I think we
                  all know the answer to: the test is
                  rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to
                  be unwinnable.

<b>                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
</b>                  Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of
                  the exam is relevant to these
                  proceedings.

<b>                                KIRK
</b>                  Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test
                  itself is a cheat.

<b>                                SPOCK
</b>                  Your argument precludes the possibility

     on Kirk. This is his boy. His recruit. And he's INVESTED.

<b>                               SPOCK

</b>                 You, of all people should know, Cadet
                 Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.

     ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed.      The cockiness
     slips away as he senses where this is going --

<b>                               KIRK

<b>                               SPOCK

                 assumed command of his vessel before
                 killed in action, did he not?

     Shit.   The DADDY card.   Kirk, a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT --

     it's just too damn entertaining...

</b>                 I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our
                 vernacular. I've simply made the logical
                 deduction that you're a liar.

<b>                               KIRK

<b>                              KIRK
</b>                Enlighten me again.

<b>                              SPOCK
</b>                The purpose is to experience fear. Fear
                in the face of certain death. To accept
                that fear and maintain command of one's
                self and one's crew. This is a quality
                expected in every Starfleet captain.

     Kirk absorbs that.   Then --

<b>                              KIRK
</b>                So you're telling me the point.      Of the
                whole thing. Is to be afraid?

<b>                              SPOCK
</b>                Fear is necessary, yes.

<b>                              KIRK
</b>                Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?

<b>                              SPOCK
</b>                Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no
                additional training to control my
                narcissism when making command decisions.

     No he DIN'T!   Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
     but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.

<b>                              KIRK
</b>                You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.
                And I'm sure you're really proud of that,
                who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you
                people don't experience fear at all?

     ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter
     how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -

<b>                              KIRK (CONT'D)

                about your ability to make command
                decisions?

     Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot.
     And before this lovefest can continue --

     A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they
     all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to
     the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it.
     Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:

<b>                              ACADEMY PRESIDENT
</b>                        (to all)

                        (Spock reacts concerned)
                Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic
                probation pending the result of your
                hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle

                at recess until further notice --
                dismissed.

     irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but
     before he goes --

<b>                              PIKE
</b>                Cheating isn't winning.

     And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two
     exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --

     Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY
     from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss-
     crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly
     STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:

                 inside, disable that thing then beam back
                 to the ship.

      off, into the turbolift -- Uhura follows him --

      Spock and Uhura. Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to
      say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of
      his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does
      something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she
      wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just
      holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and
      comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the
      intimacy before -- this is their secret...

      and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her.

      stops. Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a

      After a beat he moves to her. Awkward.

                  However, if crew morale would be better

      A strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge.
      Spock moves to meet him. Off McCoy, fuming --

      A fucking BLIZZARD.   Kirk and Spock Prime move through the

      background. In the middle of the huge, depressing space is a
      table. And a STARFLEET OFFICER who is ASLEEP, legs kicked up,
      leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. Keenser taps
      the Officer's boot.

                 I got into a debate with my instructor on
                 the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
                 pertain to subspace travel... He seemed
                 to think that the range of transporting
                 say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few
                 hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
                 I could not only beam a bird from one
                 planet to an adjacent planet in the same
                 system -- which is no big deal anyway --
                 but if I were so inclined I could
                 actually do it with a lifeform! So I
                 tested it on Admiral Archer's prize
                 beagle. Which... was a mistake.

                 warp speed. And that you only required

      rematerialize... it's KIRK, eyes wide in suspense. He looks
      down at his legs, his chest, his arms to make sure he's still in
      one piece, glances over to share his relief with Scotty... BUT
      SCOTTY ISN'T THERE. A strange BANGING -- Kirk turns: the
      BANGING is coming from a large metal TANK -- then Scotty appears
      in a TRANSLUCENT PIPE -- FREAKING OUT -- BANGING ON THE CLEAR
      METAL -- Kirk's mind races -- he looks around for a way to save
      his new friend -- just then a STRONG CURRENT IS FELT inside the
      tube -- AND SCOTTY IS YANKED AWAY, DOWN THE TUBE!

<b>                                 KIRK
</b>                 -- no-- shit!

      And Kirk runs after him -- down the length of the ORANGE,
      TWISTING and TURNING tubes -- SCOTTY SEEN every time he enters a
      CLEAR TUBE AREA -- then DISAPPEARING again into the ORANGE tubes
      -- and Scotty gets sucked UPWARDS -- and Kirk turns and looks --

</b>      GIANT WATER TURBINE -- essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING BLENDER.

                   behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,
                   the magnetic distortion from the planet's

<b>      THE ENTERPRISE DROPS OUT OF WARP IN THE DEAD SILENCE OF SPACE...
</b>
      And we move past it, along the orbit of the moon, cresting the
      horizon to see EARTH -- AND NERO'S SHIP HOVERING ABOVE IT.

      CLOSE ON NERO -- his face illuminated on the DARKENED BRIDGE of
      the Narada by SOFT BLUE LIGHT. Light radiated by EARTH. A
      BEAUTIFUL HOLOGRAM before him. He doesn't notice behind him, as
      those BLADES from his STAFF APPEAR BEHIND HIS NECK. Nero
      tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: AYEL HOLDS THE
      WEAPON. Strong. Tough. But under it all... terrified.

<b>                                AYEL

                 We have to turn the ship around. We can
                 save our home.

      Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses:

<b>                               AYEL (CONT'D)
</b>                 Stop.

      Nero now faces Ayel, blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more
      nervous as he faces his master. The surrounding crew stare on,
      frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift
      mutiny with scared looks.

                   have taken our vengeance on Vulcan. No
                   more. We want to go home now.

      Nero considers this... nods gently.

<b>                                  NERO
</b>                   There is no need, Ayel.   To threaten me.
                           (beat)
                   I understand.

      Ayel is massively relieved.     Nero gently reaches out, holds the
      staff (still aimed at him).     He deactivates it -- the blades
      instantly RETRACT.

<b>                                   NERO (CONT'D)
</b>                   I understand.    But you are wrong.

      And just as Ayel realizes he's fucked, Nero somehow activates
      the staff in a way we have not seen -- AND THE BLADES APPEAR ON
<b>      THE OTHER END -- THE END NOW FACING AYEL -- AND JUST AS AYEL'S
</b><b>      EYES GO WIDE -- NERO THRUSTS THE BLADES INTO AYEL -- WHO FALLS

                   balance between us -- I should say
                   you and Kirk -- that often made the

      Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
      past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
      absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

                   you with a commendation for original
                   thinking.

      He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

      Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest.

<b>                                 KIRK
</b>                   Thank you, Sir.

      Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk
      rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK
      of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words.
      He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --

                   Same ship, different day.

      And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console
      with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge
      feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept.

</b>           Then I ask that you do yourself a
           favor... put away logic, and do what
           feels right. The world you've inherited
           lives in the shadow of incalculable
           devastation... but there's no reason you
           must face it alone.

And from around his neck, he removes the PENDANT that until now,
we've only caught glimpses of. Places it on the table beside
his younger self. The feeling in his eyes is profound...

<b>                         SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
</b>           This was a gift to me.   Representing...
           a dream. One we were unable to fulfill.
                   (softly)
           The way you can now.

And moves to the door.    Stops.   Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

<b>                         SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
</b>           As my customary farewell would appear
           oddly self serving, I will simply say...
           good luck.

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
jumble of thoughts. Looks to the pendant... and realizes it's a
HOLO-EMITTER. After considering a beat, he hits an activation
button and a MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him:

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK. WILLIAM SHATNER.      As always, brash, wry,
confident -- and SINGING:

           you...
                   (stops, grins)
           I know I know, it's illogical to
           celebrate something you had nothing to do
           with, but I haven't had the chance to
           congratulate you on your appointment to
           the ambassadorship so I thought I'd seize
           the occasion... Bravo, Spock -- they tell
           me your first mission may take you away
           for awhile, so I'll be the first to wish
           you luck... and to say...
                   (beat, emotional)
           I miss you, old friend.

Kirk's future self, the message, but above all -- the clear,
unquestionable friendship these two men had...

<b>INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
just passed him is... oddly familiar.

<b>                         KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)

           stepped onto the Enterprise as boys?
           That I had to prove to the crew I
           deserved command... and their respect?

And we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, proud. A man.
And to every fan's delight, finally wearing his YELLOW SHIRT.
