               In the backseat of a Presidential limousine, BOB (late-
               forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, 
               staring out the window.

               P.O.V. from car window- We see buildings covered in bright 
               signs, a billboard of Brad Pitt selling jeans, another of 
               Bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of 
               whiskey in a Suntory ad... more signs, a huge TV with perky 
               Japanese pop stars singing.

<b>               EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) 
               pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky 
               rise.

               The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out.   Eager 
               BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, 
               welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags.

<b>               INT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT
</b>
               Bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by 
               Japanese businessmen below his shoulders.

               The elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto

               the massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt.

               Bob follows the JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN out into the marble and 
               glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo.

               The CONCIERGE and several eager HOTEL MANAGERS greet Bob. He 
               just wants to sleep, but more STAFF continue to greet him, 
               ask him about his fright. They lead him to reception.

<b>               INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT
</b>
               At the reception area four JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN and two WOMEN 
               quickly sit up from their seats on sight of Bob, and extend 
               handshakes and gifts. They bow and introduce themselves from 
               the commercial company, extend name cards and welcome him 
               enthusiastically.

               More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his 
               stay.

               One of them presents a fax that has come for him.

               He doesn't know what to do with it, and stuffs it in his 
               pocket.

               The commercial people tell him when they'll be picking him 
               up, and ask if he needs anything else.

               Some JAPANESE ROCK STARS with shag haircuts and skinny leather 
               pants pass by. Each commercial person has to shake Bob's 
               hand before leaving.

               Bob sits on the end of the bed in a too small hotel kimono.

<b>               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT
</b>
               Bob sits at the bar. A few minutes pass as he sits in silence 
               looking around, drinking a scotch.  Chet Baker sings "The 
               Thrill is Gone" over the stereo.

               We see Bob's POV of tables of people talking. JAPANESE WOMEN 
               SMOKING, AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN tying one on, talking about 
               software sales. A WAITER carefully setting down a coaster, 
               and pouring a beer very, very slowly. It's all very foreign.

<b>               INT.HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

               Bob gets in the shower overlooking the view of Tokyo. The 
               shower head is at his elbows, he raises it as high as it 
               goes, and leans down to have a shower. This hotel was not 
               designed with him in mind.

<b>               INT. STUDIO - DAY
</b>
               Whiskey commercial shoot.

               The set is full of activity as the JAPANESE CREW work. Bob, 
               in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a European style bar set 
               with a cut crystal glass of whiskey. A JAPANESE GIRL quickly 
               powders his face as they adjust lights and the DIRECTOR and 
               crew speak in hurried Japanese.

               The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long 
               sentences in Japanese.

               TRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, 
               translates but it is only a short sentence now.

<b>                                     TRANSLATOR
</b>                         He wants you to turn, look in camera 
                         and say the lines.

               Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it 
               works from Japanese to English.

<b>                                     BOB
</b>                         That's all he said?

<b>                                     TRANSLATOR
</b>                         Yes, turn to camera.

               Bob thinks let's just get it over with.

<b>                                     BOB
</b>                         Turn left or right?

               The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the 
               director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director 
               answers her in a long excited phrase.

<b>                                     TRANSLATOR
</b>                         Right side. And with intensity.

</b>                         Is that everything? It seemed like 
                         he was saying a lot more.

               The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods 
               in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on.

<b>                                     TRANSLATOR
</b>                         Like an old friend, and into the

                         Suntory Time!

               They get ready, and roll camera:

               Bob turns and looks suavely to the camera:

<b>                                     BOB
</b>                         For relaxing times, make it Suntory 
                         Time.

               The Director yells something about ten sentences long. The 
               translator nods.

<b>                                     TRANSLATOR
</b>                         Could you do it slower, and with 
                         more intensity?

<b>                                     BOB
</b>                         Okay.

               The Translator answers for him in four sentences.

               ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting 
               shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera 
               and gives them the line.

               Some drunk AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN, with their ties thrown over

               Bob comes back to his room. The maids have left everything 
               perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the TV has been 
               left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups 
               in nature while sad violin music plays. It's supposed to be 
               relaxing, but it's just sad.

               Bob lies in bed. He flips through TV channels from the remote 
               control.  He passes a Japanese game show, to an 80s Cannon 
               Ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into Japanese. He 
               turns it off as he hears a knock at the door.

               He goes to the door, and opens it part way.

               A WOMAN in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt 
               and stockings comes in. She is wearing '60s style make-up.

               Bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her.

               Bob's POV - We see her back to us as she puts a CD on the 
               stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte 
               Bardot sing "Bonnie & Clyde".  The woman turns slyly around 
               and shimmies over to Bob.

               goes along with it passively.

               He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just 
               snap.

               He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back 
               on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around 
               awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting

               In the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast 
               alone. Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats. At

               and drink coffee.

               Bob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by 
               the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his 
               stay.

               In the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE 
               and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding.

               Across, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE, 
               a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only 
               other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands 
               out in the crowd.

               She's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in 
               the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the 
               elevator doors.

               Charlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese 
               heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door 
               opens and she gets out with the crowd. Bob watches her leave.

               In front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted 
               and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory.

               small documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera-

               alone having a drink. A JAZZ BAND FROM SAUSALITO performs. 
               The SINGER is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed 
               in red, and takes her singing very seriously. She sings a 
               slow version of "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme".

               C.U. - a golden beer is poured very slowly.

               Bob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away.

               Across the bar, Charlotte sits with JOHN, her husband (he is 
               in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way), and 
               some FRIENDS - super stylish, weird Japanese fashion people 
               (all smoking). One of them, CHARLIE, in a shiny suit, keeps

               soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese.

               He gets on it, and sinks. He tries to make the arms and foot

               instead.

</b>
               Charlotte lies on the floor with big headphones on, listening 
               to a book on tape. After a corny music intro, a very serious 
               scholar man's voice speaks clearly :

               DR. KENGARD (0.S.) Did you ever wonder what your purpose in 
               life is? This book is about finding your soul's purpose or 
               destiny. Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is 
               not clear.  The acorn theory is an example of each soul 
               beginning with an imprint....

               Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling 
               like a loser listening to a self-help tape. She looks at the 
               doctor's photo on the audio-book box, he's bald, in a 
               turtleneck and glasses.

               Charlotte follows a JAPANESE FAMILY in formal dress out of 
               the elevator onto the mezzanine level. She wanders down a 
               big hall.

               She sees an open door and steps in the crowded room, which 
               is in the midst of a press conference. Cameras flash as Kelly, 
               with wide eyes, behind a table, answers questions 
               enthusiastically.

               KELLY You know, barbecuing, and yoga, and I love taking my 
               dogs, Buster and Lulu, for walks on the beach... and it was 
               great learning karate for "Midnight Racer" - I did all my 
               own stunts!

               The JAPANESE JOURNALISTS seem excited by her answer.

               Kelly throws a Karate punch for a PHOTOGRAPHER.

               Charlotte continues down a hall, she stops at an open door 
               and peeks in.

               A quiet group of JAPANESE WOMEN are gathered around a table. 
               Charlotte goes in, as she gets closer she sees they are being 
               instructed in Ikebana floral design. Each woman has a little 
               vase and elegant flower cuttings. She watches as they 
               delicately arrange the tiny flowers.

               The INSTRUCTOR hands Charlotte a vase and cuttings. Alongside 
               the women, Charlotte tries to follow along.

               Tokyo goes by out the window. Charlotte looks at the PEOPLE 
               on the crowded train. A sweaty BUSINESSMAN blots his face 
               with a little handkerchief.  Another older BUSINESSMAN reads 
               an erotic comic book.

               Charlotte looks up at the many signs, trying to figure out

               which way to go, but they are all in Japanese characters.

               Charlotte walks down a little street in a quiet neighborhood.

               She stops at a window of a portrait studio and looks at all 
               of the wedding portraits. They are very formal and retouched, 
               Japanese brides and grooms dressed in a Western old-fashion 
               style.

               In a crowded arcade, Charlotte watches some kids play Dance

               the

               light-up floor. One BUSINESSMAN in a suit is really good and 
               into it.

               She sees a sushi chef game where you have to cut an electronic 
               fish.

               She looks at a firefighter game, and rows of plexi boxes 
               filled with some little character dolls you try to win.

               She walks over to a small gallery space and goes up to the 
               wall to see the small photos.

               They are of tied-up, partially naked Japanese school girls, 
               one girl is spanking another one with a stuffed animal. She's 
               making a face of ecstacy.

               We hear the shower running in the bathroom.

               Charlotte decorates the room, putting up some paper cherry

               She goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it, as she

               She looks across at two middle-aged MID-WESTERN WOMEN talking 
               about plastic surgery, you can't hear them, but can tell as 
               they gesture and one pulls her eye lids up.

               They don't know what to say. Somehow it's too intimate having 
               breakfast. She eats her breakfast aware of her every movement.

               Charlotte lies in bed awake. The clock says its 4 a.m.

               Finally she gives up on trying to sleep, and turns the light 
               on. In John's old T-shirt and Ugg boots, she goes to the 
               couch, looks at some strange pastry with an elaborate 
               presentation left by the hotel.

               She picks up a magazine, but she's already looked at it a 
               few times before. She hears something and goes over to the 
               door. On her way, she passes her red T. Anthony suitcase 
               overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in 
               it.

               A HOTEL MESSAGE envelope is slipped under the door. She opens 
               it to see a typed note from the operator:

               "From: Mr. Harris. Message: Are you awake?"

               She smiles like she's gotten a valentine.

               She knocks into a low table, bumping her knee as she comes 
               in.

               Bob pours some cold sake, smoothly.

               to reach it before it stops ringing.

               Bob looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map, wondering if 
               he's in the right place. It's quiet and looks like a generic 
               office building.

               He goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on 
               the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never 
               thought was there.

               Lights strobe and Peaches' seedy "Fuck the Pain Away" booms 
               through the speakers.

               Tan JAPANESE STRIPPERS with platinum hair dance and hang 
               from a pole on a little platform.

               Bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of 
               place and empty.

               He looks over at a table of young AMERICAN INVESTMENT BROKERS. 
               He wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable.

               Charlotte shows up with Charlie and the other guys. She sits 
               down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill 
               me?' look.

               He looks at her like it's been forever. She smiles for 
               forgiveness.

               They look over and see a WEIRD GUY in the corner getting a 
               lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the 
               place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it.

               Through a beaded curtain, Charlie and Bambi get lap dances 
               in a dark corner of pillows.

               Charlotte looks at Bob.

               Bob and Charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses 
               them. They don't know why, but just make their way down an 
               empty side street. Little plastic cherry blossom decorations 
               hang above them.

               She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake 
               "one-cup". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an 
               iced coffee.

               As they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. 
               It's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and 
               just a SLEEPING MAN sits in the back of the lounge, and a 
               snuggled up romantic JAPANESE COUPLE sit close to: Kelly, 
               the blonde actress, singing to them.

               She stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing "Nobody 
               Does It Better" with all her heart.

               Bob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying

               The picture is of her and John on their honeymoon. The phone

               Charlotte walks through a beautiful garden. She's a small 
               figure in the landscape.

               She approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding 
               procession. A young bride and groom in traditional kimono 
               walk under a parasol with their family.

               Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her 
               mother's hand. The young groom walks along with them.

               Charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the 
               temple and the wedding party. Her eyes well up.

               She walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves.

               At the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine.

               At its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces 
               of paper tied to its branches. She sees Japanese people 
               writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. Charlotte 
               writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch.

               A member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little 
               silver tray.

               Miss Kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in 
               traditional Japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do 
               with them and has to carry them.

               The Executive Woman from the bar walks up to him. He hangs 
               up the phone.

               She looks at him like, we could have had some fun.

</b>                         Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

               He sees Charlotte come out of the elevator.

<b>                                     BOB
</b>                         I have to go, thanks, bye.

               He rushes over to Charlotte. She looks at his bag.

</b>                         Just saying good-bye to everyone 
                         before you leave?

               She hands him his jacket.

               She waits for him to say something more. He wants to tell 
               her he loves her, that she should come with him.

               The concierge tells him his car is here.

                         Ok, bye.

               She walks away.

               A hotel manager asks Bob about his luggage, another asks if 
               he had a pleasant stay. Charlotte gets in the elevator to go 
               out, the doors close on her back.

               It's bright outside the main entrance. A presidential pulls 
               up and the automatic door opens. Bob squints as the Bellboy 
               in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk.

</b>
               In the backseat, Bob leans back on the little doily.

               The car pulls away.

               Around the corner, he looks down a crowded alley and sees 
               Charlotte's blonde hair.

</b>                         Can you pull over a second?

               The DRIVER, wearing white cloth gloves, pulls the car over 
               slowly. Bob tries to open the door'99 it won't open, he has 
               to wait for the automatic doors to open for him (slowly).

<b>               EXT. TOKYO STREETS - DAY
</b>
               Bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw 
               Charlotte. The street is crowded with JAPANESE PEOPLE, and 
               different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light 
               rain).

               Music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some 
               promo going on with GIRLS handing out little cologne samples. 
               Bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, 
               and super tan JAPANESE KIDS.

               In the distance an umbrella moves to reveal Charlotte.

               But she can't hear him over the loudspeaker. He rushes to 
               her.

               C.U. she turns and we see she is crying.

               The music swells. He embraces her, holding her close to him 
               in the crowd.

               He kisses her, hugs her good-bye.

               He holds her close.

               Charlotte watches Bob as he reaches his car, he turns and 
               looks at her.

               She smiles at him, and is lost in the crowd.

               Bob gets into his car.

               Charlotte walks with the crowd as they go on their way.

               Back in the Presidential, alone, Bob leans against the little 
               doily.  They drive off.

               He looks out the window, Bob's happy he's going home, he's 
               happy he came to Tokyo.

               Bob's P.O.V.-  Tokyo goes past his window.
