    WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are
    listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS.

    We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a
    changing city, LONDON.

<b>                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
</b>              Two years ago this property cost one
              million pounds.
                  (we SEE building)
              Today, it costs five million.

    The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to
    see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera
    will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene.
<b>                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
</b>              How did this happen?
                  (CUT TO relevant
                   pictures as he speaks)
              Attractive tax opportunities for
              foreign investment, restrictive
              building consent and massive hedge
              fund bonuses,...
                  (beat)
              London, my good man, is fast becoming
              the financial and cultural capital
              of the world.

<b>                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
</b>              And of course the Russians have come
              to town.

<b>                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
</b>              Makes it hard to compete with an ex-
              Soviet oligarch that has six billion
              dollars in his back pocket. They
              don't haggle the price, they double
              the price.

<b>                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
</b>              Russians come, prices rise, and it
              doesn't stop. It only goes one way.

<b>                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
</b>              Up.

<b>                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
</b>              I can't teach you how to skin a cat,
              but I can tell you a lot about the
              money in bricks and mortar.

     Lenny is looking out to One Two and Mumbles who are standing
     outside his car looking very white. Lenny screams from the
     back seat.

               am still outta pocket two large ones.

     The window goes up and the car pulls off.      Lenny picks up
     his phone, he dials huffing and puffing.

     As the door is opened we see a small crowd of MEN in suits

</b>               First, let me make clear how much we
               can help you benefit from this deal.
               With out me, it will take you five
               to ten years to get the permission
               to erect your arena.
                   (beat)
               Second, with Government policy as it
               so stands we both know it's unlikely
               that you'd ever get that consent.
                   (beat)
               Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions
               and building consent, you'd be paying
               6 to 12 million without any real
               guarantee of that result.

     We CUT TO Uri unfazed, he just wants the figure.

     Uri walks to the bar. Lenny follows trying to contain his
     excitement, he's out of his league, a "welcome to the
     billionaires club" look has struck him pink. Lenny passes a
     PICTURE that's sat on an EASEL.

     Uri is at the bar now. He has placed one large tumbler down
     and is pouring a very very large measure out.

               it will give you luck.

     Lenny looks at the bar. Uri motions, there is a SMALL KEG

     A man and woman sit on one side of a desk, MEET STELLA AND

     tubby and bald). There's a stand off.

     it to their leather belts.

     WE CUT BACK TO TEN YEARS AGO. Cut to a shot of a 12 year
     old BOY with a cut under his eye singing "Bank Robber" by
     The Clash in to the mirror. He's wearing just his boxer
     shorts and enjoying himself, he's gonna be a rock star.
     From behind WE SEE his bedroom door open, but the music is
     to loud for the boy to have heard the entrance. We SEE Lenny,
     ten years younger entering, we can tell via the body language
     that he is irritated. He pauses then walks up suddenly
     slapping the boy very hard across the side of the face.
     It's enough to knock him out, the boy goes down - shot like
     a bullet out of a barrel. The red hand then slaps the stereo
     off.

                   (singing)
               Pedro's dad's a tickling monster!

     Johnny helps himself to some WASTERS drink at the bar for a
     quick refreshment. Understandably, the WASTER doesn't look
     happy and his three FRIENDS don't look happy either.

<b>                             WASTER
</b>               That's my drink.

     Johnny gives the WASTER and his FRIENDS the masturbation
     signal without even bothering to look at them.

<b>                             PETE
</b>               Fuck you singalong, you're no help
               and stop calling me Pedro.

     The WASTER grabs a bottle from the bar ready to take some
     action. Johnny grabs a pencil from his top pocket, he holds
     it out like it's a knife. It's almost a joke.

<b>                             JOHNNY STORY
</b>               Come on boy, I'll have you and ya
               girlfriends! I'll do the lot of
               yazz.

     The WASTER is lost. Johnny is not physically scary, he's
     only scary because he's quite clearly mad. He looks like
     Robert Deniro in Taxi driver, mad as mars, he catches himself
     in the mirror, he likes what he sees. Ciggy falling out of
     his mouth, he sort of takes the piss out of himself, smiles
     "tough Johnny," the WASTER backs off he doesn't want junkie
     madness.

     He looks over and see's Pete has got the most horrific scars
     on his back. Johnny notice's them and stops in his tracks.
     Johnny walks back over to Pete and very tenderly touches his
     back, it feels horrible and bobbled.

     and look up.

     doesn't like it. All the boys look on like One Two's going
     to hug him. He doesn't.

     Pause. Lenny milks the moment and after a few seconds of
     mock thought, he speaks.

                Which brings me conveniently to my
                next point. Ever since the painting,
                my lucky painting, hasn't been hanging
                on my wall, things have not
                been,....so lucky. I know this is a

      One Two makes room in front of him and starts to dance
      relativity badly. You get the feeling he probably could
      dance, but he just can't be bothered to make an effort.

      She stands up and dances just like him.

                bold, black and white is the
                statement, that these neat little
                soldiers of death, are in fact, trying

      Bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway
      car waiting. We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their
      car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are
      carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly
      opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the
      window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans
      in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's
      wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles
      uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.

<b>                              MUMBLES
</b>                There's another case, grab it.

      One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1.
      As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the
      car by CHECHNYAN 2.

      Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays
      mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes.

                the Guerrilla!

      CHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength
      and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can
      SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car
      looking concerned.

      fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the

      One Two manages to head butt CHECHNYAN 2 and goes back to
      reclaiming the case from CHECHNYAN 1. He pulls it out and
      Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing.

      Major confusion is setting in. They run back to their car,
      which is still running, Mumbles shoves One Two into the back
      and jumps in the drivers seat.

      With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation
      and turns to check on One Two. From out of nowhere a very
      large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles
      in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting
      go.

      The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that
      has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious
      ledge, it's dangling with the CHECHNYAN 2 still not letting
      go.

      One Two can get a clear shot into the CHECHNYAN 2's side.
      He shots him once, CHECHNYAN 2 doesn't move, twice, three
      times, four times, he finally lets go and falls down on the

     As they get out of the car, WE SEE CHECHNYAN 1 has now made
     his way down the street. He is punch drunk with mace in his
     eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket. The
     boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1
     is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He
     lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who
     all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips
     into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his
     opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to
     him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his
     head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a
     new magazine. Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two
     is attached to his arm.

     A baseball smashes into Mumbles face, he goes down, and he's
     out. CHECHNYAN 2 has appeared carrying a metal baseball
     bat. One Two picks up the machine gun.

     CHECHNYAN 2 keeps coming, One Two doesn't want to do it but
     he has to. He lets off twenty three bullets into the
     CHECHNYAN 2's chest, the CHECHNYAN is knocked back and
     disappears over the mezzanine. One Two is in shock, he has
     never killed a man. He stands there numb.

     It pulls up and the boys pile in, what's left of them. They
     pull away from the sports shop.

     He slams on the brakes. CHECHNYAN 2 goes flying over the
     roof, but stops himself hitting the road by perforating the
     hood with his massive knife. He proceeds to perforate the
     wind screen with another knife that he extracts and (because
     of laminate) starts to saw through the wind screen. The
     boys are in horror.

     One Two gets caught in a head lock by CHECHNYAN 2, they
     struggle. Mumbles hits the CHECHNYAN from behind with a car

     The crew split in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. Bob takes the cases
     and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes
     off. Mumbles disappears another way. CHECHNYAN 2 is up and
     follows One Two - terminator style, a foot chase begins.
     One Two, split from the group and being pursued, jumps over
     a wall.

     One Two has ended up on a railway track. He turns back, why
     should CHECHNYAN 2 chase him, he hasn't got the money. But
     no, CHECHNYAN 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping
     in the wind, and coming after him. One Two finds his strength
     this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down
     the tracks.

     The pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a
     pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes
     on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can
     see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and
     sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and
     starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2
     is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his
     eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will
     remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he
     almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
     him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.

     One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
     a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
     machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than
     One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the
     moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the
     moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the
     moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he
     can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit."
     This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts
     in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and
     runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.

      Victor has extracted a five iron from out of the golf bag
      and has decided to break both of Lenny's legs in ten different
      places. Lenny screams in unimaginable agony, writhing on
      the green. Uri almost ignores the activity.

      One Two comes in and closes the door behind him.

      He looks down on the floor and there is THE PAINTING, we see
      a large note on it that says.

      "Let myself in, thought your lady would like the painting.

      The door bell rings, he opens it and there stands Stella.
      She walks in straight past One Two, he turns round with his

<b>                                 VICTOR
</b>                Uri is a man born with nothing, carved
                his way up the hard way, he's smart,
                young and only one thing will stop
                him from reaching his goals,...women.
                And this woman has become a problem.
                    (pause)
                My job is to protect Uri and in this
                department he needs protecting, I
                don't like her or trust her and I
                want you to follow that snake.

      We reveal it's CHECHNYAN 1 our war criminal who is looking
      battered from the beating the day before.

      We go back to the scene at the restaurant from a different
      perspective. The two CHECHNYAN'S see One Two and Handsome
      Bob walk out of the restaurant, they two look at one another,
      their brows steel.

      CUT BACK to present with the music being cut off from One
      Two's head phones. He opens his eyes, on his throat lies a
      very long and sharp knife. The two CHECHNYANS have entered
      the room and pulled the wire out of the machine. CHECHNYAN
      1 is sitting on a chair next to One Two, he's the one with
      the blade. He smiles, One Two doesn't.

      Archy approaches the door with Danny behind, he pushes it,
      it opens. Concerned, he pulls out a shooter, so does Danny,
      they go in.

      The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make
      their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door.
      The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he
      pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we
      reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little
      amused.

      Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head
      is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle
      of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles
      uselessly.

      On the floor facing the other direction is our pretty much
      naked Chechnyan doing a traditional Chechnyan dance, which
      involves lots of extended leg action.

      He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from
      his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive
      frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two
      previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly
      dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all
      sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by
      the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused.
      He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking
      distressed. Silence ensues.

      FOUR shots ring out quickly.

      Johnny walks up, he's wearing tales and a bow tie, he's with
      two of his toffy school FRIENDS.

      Archy throws Johnny a packet of rolos and turns to get in
      the car. As he turns, Johnny lifts up the back of his sports
      jacket and steals his gun. The two FRIENDS are in shock,
      needless to say so is Archy. Johnny holds it on his two

      His face has been slapped into the direction of Roman and

      Archy straightens his tie to remain calm, but can't take it
      any longer. He picks Johnny up and slams him against the

      Archy drops him, his wires crossed.        He needs a little time

      Johnny is off out of the elevator walking away happy as a

      Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims,
      he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth
      into Lenny's wide open mouth.

      Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it
      and starts to cut his way out of the ropes. Archy gets back
      on with the job at hand. He reads through the names Lenny
      has grassed on over the years.

      Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish
      death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair. He
      presses the start button and the wheelchair is raised with

                able to wait because you now know
                what's coming, so he's gonna fire.

      Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted
      everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun.
      Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger,
      and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the
      wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's
      head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets
      a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood,
      speaks coolly.
