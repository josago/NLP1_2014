               A DRUM. Beating slow. And deep. Like a heart.

</b>
               Something is rising from the Black Hills. A sphere of light, 
               too red to be the sun. A sphere of contained fire, undulating 
               in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to 
               the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha Sapa 
               sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular.

               The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. 
               Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and 
               foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as 
               the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. 
               And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it. 
               Slowly.

               Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wakan 
               Tanka - The Great Mystery.

               And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head 
               comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLOW 
               MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The INDIAN 
               MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his 
               neck.

               Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, 
               backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... his 
               heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE 
               VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song.

               And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, 
               airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it 
               would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, 
               mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly 
               overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gunfire 
               which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him. 
               Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quickly 
               and violently as a deer shot dead.

               LAKOTA SONG ends abruptly.

<b>               LONG SHOT - THE GREAT PLAINS
</b>
               the sun burns like lava at the horizon. DRUM beats like a 
               heart. And Somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an OWL. 
               Then Silence. Deep, disturbing stillness.

<b>               EXT. CAPITAL BELTWAY - WASHINGTON. D.C - DAY

               ROCK N'ROLL shatters the silence.

               Cars -- a multicolored metallic criss-cross reflecting off a 
               building made of mirrors -- races past an electronic billboard 
               that blinks in red skyhigh digital: PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE. 
               7:59. 73 degrees.

               The D.C. Superhighway. And off behind it, in the distance, 
               Capital Hill holds imposing vigil, the massive cast iron 
               dome of The Capital, catching the sun. But everything is 
               soon smothered by a METRO BUS, hogging the far lane of the 
               Beltway, leaning on its HORN.

               Good morning.

               And the rock n'roll is everybody's radio, everybody's tempo.

<b>               CARBON MONOXIDE WAVE
</b>
               shimmers across the beltway hugging then releasing a solitary 
               vehicle that we stay with... move with... A black Nissan 240 
               SX, hard-waxed.

<b>               INT. 240 SX - TRAVELING
</b>
               Behind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped 
               black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses. Whatever he does for 
               a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit. But 
               we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead 
               into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist). Lean as a 
               rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable 
               about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go.

               RAY LEVOI, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening 
               traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty 
               cars and a cement girder.

<b>               EXT. T STREET - OUTSIDE WEST-CENTRAL
</b>
               The black SX has jumped off an exit and has entered the light-
               industrial section of Washington. It pulls up near a loading 
               dock behind an old gray building and several parked cars and 
               vans. Ray steps out, smooths his jacket, locks and SETS HIS 
<b>               CAR ALARM.
</b>
               Another young man -- chubby, clean-shaven; in a nicer suit 
               than Ray's -- steps out from a parked Miata, and approaches 
               Ray. CARL PODJWICK balances a coffee, a U.S.A. Today and a 
               black eel-skin briefcase.

               They start walking briskly toward the loading dock.

               They mount steps.

</b>                         Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.

               They stop at the door of a service elevator and Carl breathes. 
               Expanding his chest, exhaling. Ray adjusts Carl's tie for 
               him, his collar. He speaks quietly. Quickly.

                         peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.

               Carl nods. Ray hesitates, adjusts his own collar and enters 
               the service elevator. Carl follows. Door closes.

               Carl follows Ray into the big sparse room of unfinished 
               sheetrock walls. There is nothing in here but cardboard boxes, 
               and two people; a bearded HISPANIC MAN standing behind a 
               counter, writing on a clipboard. The other is a middle-aged 
               BLACK MAN in a purple silk shirt sitting in a chair with a 
               newspaper held open. He barely looks over the top of the 
               Wall Street Journal.

</b>                         Louis, my man, what's happenin'?

               Ray walks up to the counter. Carl lingers, fidgeting. Ray 
               sets his briefcase on the counter and click-clicks it open. 
               The Hispanic fence man looks inside, and begins pulling out 
               stacks of treasury checks.

               Ray gestures to Carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on 
               the counter, fumbles with the first latch. The second. He 
               flips it open.

               The fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of Grade A 
               Treasury. A lot of it. Then his eyes rise to Carl.

                         things to do here.

               The fence man pushes an intercom button and yells into a 
               speaker.

               Carl's eyes flit to Ray. Ray's eyes flit to Carl.

               Louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big Colt Python 
               from his lap just as --

               A section of sheetrock kicks open and THREE FEDERAL OFFICERS 
               bust out, each clutching a handgun, SHOUTING inaudibly.

<b>                                     LOUIS

                         floor! MOVE!

               Carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one 
               knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping 
               him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by 
               the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun. But the white 
               collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that --

               Ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets 
               over to the Mr. Coffee. He pours one, and adds some milk. 
               Turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of Sweet 
               n'Low.

</b>                         Beauty. Beauty...

               Ray rests his weight against the coffee station, takes a 
               careful sip. Carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and 
               he stands there, looking at Ray, baffled. Completely shocked.

                         it? What's your real name, you fucking

                         man. Just like the numbers on those 
                         treasury checks. You stole from your 
                         own country, Carl. Shame on you.

               Coffee in hand, Ray walks briskly toward the door.

               Ray turns. Louis takes a few steps toward him, putting his 
               gun back in his waistband.

<b>                                     LOUIS

                         see ya.

               Ray stands frozen, holding the door knob, and digesting what 
               are apparently influential words.

               Ray just stares for a moment. Then hurries out the door.

               Carl, being arm-gripped by two agents and photographed like 
               a trout, gazes bewildered at the door.

                         He had dinner at my mother's.

               CAMERA FLASHES at him, an agent on either side, striking a 
               natural pose.

               The huge, imposing, mausoleum-like Hoover building, bordered

               8x10 BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS dealt like cards onto a table,

               1 -- an aerial shot of some wasteland.

               2 -- a closer bird's eye of the same, what looks like a NASA 
               photo of Mars.

               3 -- a vast expanse of the Great Plains.

               ROBERT F. TULLY, Number-Two-in-Command, deals a fourth photo 
               onto the table. He is an understated, fatherly man, well-
               manicured in cotton pencil-striped shirt, white-tab collar 
               and tie. The photos and maps and files a foot deep on the

               Seated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep 
               spread of information, SA (Special Agent) FRANK COUTURE is 
               about to break the record for longest single ash on the end 
               of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight, 
               concentrating, slits. "COOCH" as they call him in the Bureau 
               has seen thirty years in some rough "provinces". He has 
               survived the Hoover era and is a legend in the Sessions era 
               but survival has honed an edge. An edge with a touch of ironic 
               cop humor.

               Ray enters, walks into a firm shake.

               Ray sits nervously across from Cooch who looks up from the 
               photos and studies the younger man through reading glasses 
               and cigarette smoke, and he looks at him like he doesn't 
               know who the hell he is or why he's sitting there.

               The handshake is still locked. Cooch is still squinting at 
               the younger agent. Ray obviously knows something about Agent 
               Couture.

               Tully leans back in his chair, crosses his legs casually.

                         outsiders, non-Indians. Relations

               Ray looks up at Cooch. Another uneasy beat. Cooch lights a 
               cigarette as if lighting a cigarette was a science.

                         sent them one of their own, no one's 
                         gonna ask you to weave baskets or 
                         make it rain.

               Ray sits before the files and photos, looking unsure. He has 
               come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to The 
               Graveyard. Or in the FBI argot, Indian Country.

               Tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an 
               assignment folder down in front of the young agent.

               of the distant silhouette like a waking God. HEARTBEAT DRUM. 
               Hypnotic.

               And then a car blows by, throwing up gravel and agate and 
               gypsum. ZOOOOM! Right by us. Gone.

               When a dense screen of red dust clears, an old, bent, metal 
               sign at roadside becomes visible. It reads, through punched 
               and rusted bullet holes: "Entering Bear Creek Indian 
               Reservation."

               HEARTBEAT DRUM calls in the high-pitched, mournful voices of

               Both agents eat a sandwich as they travel.

                         out here or what?

               Cooch opens a folder that sits between them, and taking his 
               eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds, locates some 
               photos, and hands them to Ray. Ray's expression tells us 
               they are not pretty.

               squatting a safe distance from the body, covering his nose 
               with a kerchief while looking in the file.

               Cooch takes a bended knee on the other side of the body. 
               Flies buzz on and around the corpse.

                         Council.

               Cooch makes a note then slowly circles the body. He holds a 
               hand out to Ray and the younger agent turns the file over.

                         to outrun that load. What do you 
                         make of the damage?

               Ray gets closer, swats at Flies with the folder.

                         it? But that's what a ten gauge, 
                         choke-bored, shotgun will look like 
                         when it hits your lower back from 
                         five feet away.

               Ray looks up impressed. Cooch rises and walks off gingerly, 
               scanning the surroundings.

               Cooch is standing ten feet away, staring at the ground. Ray 
               walks over, carefully. He follows Cooch's frown down at the 
               twisted layers of earth.

<b>               ON THE GROUND
</b>
               a circle has been etched deep in the soft gumbo, and in the 
               center of the circle, a white eagle plume sticks straight 
               up, dancing in the wind.

               Cooch and Ray each lower themselves to their haunches to 
               study the strange sight. Cooch puts his reading glasses on, 
               stares at it. Then lights a cigarette.

               Ray hefts up a camera and begins CLICKING off shots. He starts 
               moving around it, taking shots at different angles. And then 
               the sound of a DISTANT MOTOR draws both agent's attention.

<b>               POV:

               way out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth, a 
               lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds, born out of 
               a silvery heat mirage. It's fifty yards off but heading 
               straight for us. The HEARTBEAT DRUM.

               REVERSE - RAY AND COOCH try to make the figure out.

<b>               IN THE BADLANDS
</b>
               the archaic mud-caked Harley chugs and stalls, spits and 
               choices, and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep 
               side of this natural wonder. At the throttle is an imposing 
               figure.

               WALTER CROW HORSE is a portly Indian in his late-thirties 
               with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems 
               to have been cast from a bust of Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull 
               with aviator shades. Denim jacket over checkered shirt. Faded 
               jeans. Well broken duct-taped boots. His hair is worn long 
               in tight duel braids.

               The rusted bike bajas up and down slopes, finally stalling 
               out, twenty feet or so from the murder site. Crow Horse swings 
               his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse. He looks 
               around suspiciously then pulls a rolled-up blanket from the 
               carrier rack.

               lies in death. Crow Horse's boots move in stealthily, creaking 
               like saddle leather.

               He squats and looks at the corpse... then looks around with 
               animal alertness. He reaches into the front pocket of his 
               jacket and pulls out some Bull Durham tobacco. He pinches 
               some and offers it to the four directions around the body.

               He then unrolls the blanket, begins to move the dead man... 
               sense something and wheels to see Cooch standing behind him, 
               one hand behind his back where his gun must be, and the other 
               hand holding up open wallet. The sun hits his badge.

               Crow Horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock, a full second 
               before Ray steps out, his .45 drawn but held at ease.

               Crow Horse slowly raises his arms as Ray moves up to him, 
               studying him.

               Ray frisks the Indian, finds an old leather wallet, and then 
               a gun. A .38.

               A pause. A long, dead of South Dakota, Badlands pause. Cooch 
               turns and looks at Ray who holds up the open wallet, revealing 
               a badge. Like Cooch's it shines in the sun.

               Cooch stands staring at the Indian... then takes a few steps 
               over to Ray and grabs the wallet. He examines it. Then looks 
               at Crow Horse and laughs.

               The Indian cop has plenty of time to get up on his own but 
               he kneels there, tauntingly, waiting for Ray to help him. 
               Ray walks over and offers a hand. Crow Horse takes it, and 
               pulls himself up, looking square into Ray's sunglasses.

               Cooch walks over and hands the officer his wallet, and his 
               .23. Crow Horse takes the items, eyeing the older agent.

               Ray does a take but quickly recovers, meeting Crow Horse's 
               scrutinizing gaze. Crow Horse nods to Ray, and Ray nods back 
               in case it's the Indian thing to do. Crow Horse nods again. 
               Ray nods again.

               And immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a 
               burned out neon Miller light. DWIGHT YOAKUM croons "Youuuuuu-
               Got-Your Little-Ways" on the jukebox from inside.

               The Buffalo Butte bar has several cracked and sun-bleached 
               buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big 
               faded white letters painted across the front read: "No Indians 
               Allowed."

               (This sign actually exists today in the res-line border town 
               of Scenic, South Dakota). The car pulls up beside a pick-up 
               and parks. Ray and Cooch step out, careful to walk wide around 
               a PITBULL in the bed of the truck.

               A WHITE LOCAL walks out of the bar and looks askance at the 
               suits. As the two feds approach the bar, Cooch looks up at 
               the warning sign. Ray sees it too.

                         a cheeseburger.

               The young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but --

               Ray spins quickly, paranoid about entering. But the man 
               calling to them is --

               An Indian himself. TRIBAL PRESIDENT OLIVER CLEAR MOON, a 
               small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents 
               through fat bifocals. He wears a straw cowboy hat, red 
               windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or "bobtailed" as the 
               Indians say.

               Clear Moon is walking away from a parked pick-up truck, toward 
               the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity.

                         You made it. Was-te.

               Cooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the 
               man

                         Moon. You must be the Sioux.

               He is pointing his long, skinny finger at Cooch.

               Clear Moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile 
               breaking across his flaccid brown skin. He takes Ray's hand 
               in a respectful double-clutch and grips him tightly... almost 
               desperately.

<b>                                     CLEAR MOON

                         our own. Was-te.

               He keeps pumping Ray's hand, looking into his face with great 
               admiration. Cooch looks on with amusement.

<b>                                     CLEAR MOON
</b>                         Things are no good here. It is like

                         Indian people. Who knows Indian way.

               Clear Moon has not released Ray's arm as he leads them to a 
               string of seedy motel units across the street.

                         any Indian food in days...

               And Clear Moon guides them through the front door of room 
               13. Ray looks over his shoulder threateningly at Cooch who 
               winks and pats his back.

<b>               EXT. RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT
</b>
               A lone headlight appears out of the black. HEARTBEAT DRUM. 
               But faster. Relentless. A "res" car, a dented, rusted, peeling 
               old station wagon, drives slowly toward the reservation.

               Then suddenly, someone steps in front of the car. A BIG MAN 
               in cowboy boots and blue jeans.

<b>               INT. MOTEL - ROOM 13 - NIGHT
</b>
               Ray lies in bed. Awake. He is hanging off the bed with a 
               file open on the floor and using the moon to light photos 
               and memorandums. And then he hears LAUGHTER outside. And 
<b>               GLASS BREAK.
</b>
               He gets out of bed quickly, snatching up his pants, putting 
               their on, and going to the window.

<b>               POV - OUT WINDOW:

               SEVERAL LOCALS out in front of the bar help a middle-aged 
               INDIAN MAN out of the station wagon.

               A young local bends down behind the Indian while another 
               shoves him, sending him tripping over the bent man and onto 
               his back in the dirt.

               MORE LOCALS come out from the bar, beers and drinks and 
               interested in what's going on.

               at the window, observes. Cooch enters from the connecting 
               room, puffy-eyed but quickly buttoning his shirt. He shares 
               Ray's view.

               Ray is transfixed.

<b>               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT
</b>
               The Indian man, is pushed into a stumble, and caught by 
               another white man as a little game of catch takes place. 
               Cooch, stepping into the circle, shirt half unbuttoned, hair 
               a mess, looks on. Then steps in front of a big local and 
               catches the Indian as he comes stumbling. He holds onto him, 
               looking at the faces that turn his way. Ray steps up beside 
               him, looking tense.

<b>                                     COOCH

                         without some breed-ass fallin' all 
                         over me?

               And then Cooch shoves the Indian with all his might back 
               across the road. The locals resume their fun, and Cooch looks 
               at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes Ray 
               do a serious take.

<b>                                     COOCH

                         wants a kiss --

               The Indian ends up stumbling back toward Ray, and Ray catches 
               him this time. The man maintains a perfect vacant expression 
               and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening. 
               But he is dizzy, and exhausted, and Ray keeps him from 
               falling.

               Cooch looks at Ray. Their eyes meet. Ray shoves the man 
               forward. This time, instead of catching him, the local on 
               the receiving end, hauls off and punches him in the face. 
               The Indian drops.

               Cooch runs in, grabs the Indian under the arms and drags him 
               back to his car.

                         your sacred land. Get outta here.

               He shoves him behind the wheel as the locals crowd around. 
               They don't see Cooch throw the wheel stick in drive, and 
               lean into the man's ear.

               Cooch slams the door, and kicks it, and the vehicle lurches 
               forward. A beer can clanks off the rear window, and rolls 
               clanking into the middle of the road.

               Ray stands there with the locals as they all watch the car 
               drive off across the reservation line. Cooch, belly sticking 
               out of his unbuttoned shirt, and a breathless smile on his 
               face, heads to the bar without breaking stride. This man has 
               done "underground" before.

               Cooch and Ray sit in a booth with DENNIS VAUGHN, a strapping 
               local man, ranch-raised, and gentlemanly. In fact, downright

               cowboy shirt, comes over with a beer and a pensive look on 
               his face. He pulls up a chair and positions himself at the

               They stop in front of their rooms and Cooch pulls a small 
               tape recorder from his waistband. A micro-cassette recorder 
               that he examines in the dim door light.

               step as he breaks into the HANK WILLIAMS tune that has all

               Ray walks to the front door of a war-torn trailer that is 
               halfway swallowed by weeds and plants. It is static out here. 
               Dead still. Ray approaches the front door. There is a huge 
               hole in it. He knocks above the hole.

               After a moment, the door opens a crack. A dark, weather-beaten

               A tattered chair is pushed against the door, covering the 
               hole. Ray stands up, turns on the steps. And before he can 
               let out a flustered sigh, he spots something across the dirt 
               road. Something that makes him remove his shades, look again. 
               Whatever it is, it doesn't make him happy, and he is hurrying 
               across the road.

               A motorcycle, parked between the road and the badlands. We've 
               seen the ancient bike before. Ray walks past it, looking at 
               it.

               He pushes his shades up on the bridge of his nose and looks 
               down into the moonscape.

               Walter Crow Horse is down there, on his haunches, "feel

               He doesn't even look up at the sound of the FBI agent's

               Ray stands, sweating under his suit jacket, and not sure if 
               he's amazed or pissed off.

<b>               EXT MAISY BLUE LEGS HOUSE – BLACK TAIL DISTRICT - DAY
</b>
               A trailer sits off from the river in beaten solitude. There 
               are two junked cars and one burned black.

               Wind blows across deep bald tire tracks. Ray walks slowly 
               beside them, surveying, following them to a place where they 
               become puckers and skids next to a dilapidated outhouse. 
               There is a shotgun blast in the side of it. Ray studies it, 
               enters the outhouse. Exits, and walks the rutted gumbo earth 
               to where it meets rolling hills of golden grass. He stands 
               here, mesmerized.

               CHICKENS scratch around in the dirt.

               Like so many far-off res homesteads, this is a haunting place. 
               Made more so by a persistent SQUEAKING, a rusty, metallic 
               squeal coming from --

</b>
               across the yard, where MAISY BLUE LEGS, a Sioux elder, works 
               the handle. She wears thick bifocals and keeps her hair under 
               a bandanna. No water comes forth from the pump, and she tries 
               again and again until she breaks a sweat. And then she sees 
               the waal'cu standing out there.

               Urgently, she turns and starts back to her trailer with an 
               empty coffee can.

               Ray starts after her.

               She mounts the metal steps. Ray is losing her. He gets a 
               foot on the bottom step, and attempts something he does not 
               want to do.

               Halfway through the screendoor, Maisy turns and looks at the 
               young man in suit and shades.

</b>                         I'm Sioux.

               Maisy lowers her bifocals, studies him. Then walks in, slaps 
               the door shut, and locks it. A towel hung as a shade folds 
               down.

               Ray lingers at the bottom of the steps.

</b>                         Yeah, right.

               And he walks around the side of the trailer, looking at the 
               ground. In the gaping space between the trailer blocks, and 
               the grass, there is much junk stored, and Ray kneels to look. 
               He is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots, caked with dried mud. 
               He picks up a boot, looks at the sole, then touches the mud. 
               His fingers break through the hardened crust and come back 
               moist and blue. He looks at this sniffs it. There is a tense, 
               water-torture like tempo coming from the old pump where water 
               barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt. Ray sets the boot 
               down. Goes to grab the other boot and --

               a WESTERN DIAMOND BACK RATTLER coils out from the shade of 
               the boot, RATTLING and HISSING from white mouth and three-
               inch fangs, and Ray has done a backflip and roll, slapping 
               his shoulder holster and pulling lead and BLAM! BLAAAM! he 
               unloads two, and the reptile is so dead, there's not even 
               enough snake left to make a truck-stop key chain.

               He kneels there, flushed in the face, holding his breath and 
               double-clutching his gun. The SHOTS ECHO through the Badlands 
               like the aftermath of dynamite. From inside the trailer, he 
               can hear CRYING. A low moaning. Praying softly.

               Cooch takes a careful step behind Jimmy and cuffs him. Looks 
               Twice speaks to the others in LAKOTA, and they disband, 
               heading to a shade arbor where their clothes hang.

               As Cooch starts marching Looks Twice toward the house, Ray 
               keeps an eye on the departing. One of them stops halfway to 
               the fence and turns. Grandpa Reaches looks at Ray with eyes 
               that have seen one hundred and one hard years in Indian

               With his hands cuffed, he can only jerk his head toward a 
               big hole in the wall down near the foundation. Cooch quickly 
               drops to a knee and checks out the hole.

               Something horrifying happens so fast, Cooch has no time to

               executed back kick, knocking Ray off the step and to the 
               ground. The Indian bolts like a deer into the darkness.

               Ray rolls in the grass, throwing his M-16 up. He hesitates. 
               But only for a moment before FIRING and decimating the corner 
               gutter, a junked car, several trees. But no sign of Jimmy.

               Cooch falls back in the grass badly mauled. His arm has been 
               ripped open down to the bone.

               Ray reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a pack of

               Grandpa Samuel Reaches sits in a taped and tuckered easy 
               chair, his alert black eyes moving from side to side. We 
               recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at Looks Twice' 
               although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more 
               youthful look despite a face like a map of the Badlands.

               He wears a vest over a western shirt, baggy work slacks, old 
               cowboy boots.

               His brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the Marlboro 
               pack as if he's reading braille.

               Crow Horse sits across from him on a stool. Ray leans on one 
               of the plain green walls, looking uncomfortable. A three 
               foot adhesive fly strip hangs from the ceiling, thick with 
               dead ones. There is a black and white TV with Sesame Street 
               wailing, honking and guffawing through static.

               Grandpa fixes his eyes on Ray for only split seconds at a 
               time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly deep 
               reading of the young man. Slowly, he sits up -- focusing 
               intensely on Ray.

               He begins to speak. A hoarse, strained, string of LAKOTA, 
               spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward Ray. When he 
               finishes, he sits back in his chair. Ray looks intrigued.

               Ray looks puzzled. Crow Horse laughs bull-wild as Grandpa 
               takes up a fly swatter and takes out a big horsefly. The old 
               man begins speaking Indian again.

               Crow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old 
               man continues speaking. Crow Horse looks concerned, and ASKS 
               A QUESTION IN LAKOTA. We don't know what he's asking but the 
               tone is absolute amazement.

               This question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa, 
               the old one getting angry. Grandpa wins.

                         uh, back in the winter. He says you

                         you yourself don't know that.

               Ray's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian, 
               absorbing the translation. Grandpa speaks more fervently 
               now, incorporating Indian sign. Each time Grandpa does the 
               hard Sioux HAND SLAP, Ray blinks.

</b>                         He says he knew you'd be coming to 
                         Bear Creek. He was told. It is the 
                         will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather 
                         that you come here. He says let's 
                         smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, 
                         symbol of truth. So that there will 
                         be no lies between us.

               The old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone 
               bowl from a beaded pipe bag. He joins the two together then 
               begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions. 
               While this goes on, Ray fidgets.

</b>                         Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, 
                         we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture 
                         in The Pipe. That's a white man's 
                         myth. This is a sacrament.

               The old man is offering the pipe to Ray.

               Ray looks at Grandpa. The old man offers the pipe again.

</b>                         You don't smoke with him, it means 
                         you're hiding something.

               Ray takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to Crow 
               Horse. The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long 
               eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking.

               Crow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases 
               some smoke upward. Ray watches it climb and fade. The old 
               man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. He speaks.

                         down from the Grandfathers. Heavy 
                         duty.

               He shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of 
               Ray. He speaks just above a whisper.

<b>                                     CROW HORSE
</b>                         He says, it is good. The Spirits are 
                         here. The Spirits want to know what 
                         you're doing here?

               Ray smirks.

<b>                                     RAY
</b>                         Tell him I'm trying to find the man 
                         who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him 
                         if he knows where he is.

               Crow Horse asks the old man in Lakota. No answer. The pipe 
               is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to 
               the Earth then upward before smoking himself. He begins to 
               speak again.

               Passionately. In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign, 
               fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there,

               He is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps 
               looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's 
               answer.

               Finally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he 
               ends his oratory with a solid hand slap.

                         in Sioux. What did he say?

               Crow Horse ignores him. Grandpa speaks again. More hand 
               language.

               The old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse. 
               He strokes his badger claw necklace.

               Crow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this 
               new piece of information.

<b>                                     CROW HORSE

                         stops by here without gettin' stuck 
                         in the old Indian barter. He, uh... 
                         he likes your shades.

               Grandpa smiles toothlessly. Ray who has his driving glasses 
               in hand, lifts them to say "these?" but Grandpa sees it as 
               an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. He holds 
               it out.

               Ray slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes 
               the necklace. Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does 
               Grandpa, enjoying a good trade. He draws a hand through the 
               air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal. 
               Ray looks confused. Out of his element. And out of his shades.

               Another fly gets snagged on sticky tape.

               Crow Horse stops walking and eyes Ray, deliberating.

               A silent moment. Ray tries to figure out what he's missing 
               here.

                         someone's gonna die. The owl told 
                         him about Leo.

               Ray stares vacantly.

               Crow Horse KICK STARTS his bike and burns off down the drive

               Ray feels the presence of the old man, standing behind the 
               busted screen door. Just watching.

<b>               OVER THIS, A SCREAMING. A HIGH-PITCHED, CHILLING, SCREAM 
</b>               that takes us straight into --

<b>               SLACK TAIL POWWOW GROUNDS - RES - LATER

               CLOSE ON A TERRIFYING FACE -- painted in blazing red and 
               yellow, black around the eyes. A ridge of feathers high along 
               the hairline, and a mouth open, tongue trilling -- SCREAMING.

<b>               A WACIPI
</b>
               is going down. A Powow. Held in the center of a huge arbor. 
               This DANCER, a traditional Kit Fox dancer, is dressed in 
               authentic costume and is dancing with TEN OTHERS dressed in 
               various traditional garb and paints.

               Under the arbor, TWO HUNDRED INDIANS in modern clothing sit 
               on blankets or in lawn chairs, watching the dancing. A group 
               of SINGERS sit around a big drum, beating on it, and wailing 
               the song that keeps the dancers hopping.

               SIXTY CARS (res beaters) are parked off around the arbor, 
               less interested kids sitting on them, smoking cigarettes. A 
               few actually have MTV hair-cuts.

               Drifting through the cars and people are Special Agents 
               Couture, Miles, Sherman and Levoi. They stroll through, 
               incongruously, checking out faces. Vehicles.

               Ray slows his step and takes in --

<b>               THE POWWOW CIRCLE
</b>
               as the dance ends. WEAK APPLAUSE. The POWWOW CALLER, a big 
               Sioux with a crew-cut and cowboy shirt, speaks through a 
               scratchy P.A. system.

                         Hey!

               An OLD-INDIAN MAN sitting in a lawn chair, removes his cowboy 
               hat and reaches down toward a blanket. He brings up his VFW 
               hat, adorned with medals and puts it on. Slowly, he rises, 
               and shuffles out to the center pole along with --

               FOUR OTHER VETERANS who have exchanged cowboy hats for 
               veteran's caps. There is even a traditional dancer in there, 
               wearing a veteran cap. As a mournful WAR SONG is banged out 
               by the singers, a flag is unrolled by the veterans. An 
               American Flag. Unrolled, and set on the mast. And together, 
               all five Indian men, hoist --

<b>               THE AMERICAN FLAG

               high. Slowly it climbs. Proudly. It blows in the hot South 
               Dakota wind.

<b>               OUTSIDE THE ARBOR

               Ray stands, watching this. And then the SONG ENDS. A loud, 
               angry voice breaks across the P.A.

<b>               AT THE CROW'S NEST (CALLER'S BOOTH)

               ANDERSON CHASING HAWK, a young Indian in ribbon shirt and 
               long hair has taken possession of the microphone. SIX W.A.R.N. 
               MEMBERS stand behind him. He speaks loud, firm, with the 
               sharp gestures of an old way Chief.

                         That flag has been desecrated by the 
                         United States, because they have not 
                         honored what that flag represents!

               The veterans just stand under the flag, solemn, looking at 
               Chasing Hawk. The flag undulates soundlessly.

               EAGLE BEAR would be the most beautiful woman Ray has even 
               seen if she was not the meanest-looking. Her thick black 
               hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse-hair 
               belt. Her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots. 
               And she is full of fire. She begins speaking in LAKOTA. 
               Fluently. And with hand sign, like the old man.

<b>               OUTSIDE THE ARBOR

               the agents stand. Cooch is writing into a small notebook.

               As Ray watches her, someone approaches in a less hostile 
               manner. It is President Clear Moon, looking very upset. He 
               holds the hand of a LITTLE GIRL, dressed in traditional 
               dancing garb.

               He approaches Ray.

               And he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor.

               Chasing Hawk, Maggie and the other Warriors strut up to the 
               agents. All but one who is bound to a wheelchair. We've seen 
               RICHARD YELLOW BIRD, the big Cheyenne who wears a Red Power 
               baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals -- in one of 
               the file photos. His arms are plastered with tattoos.

                         dancing today.

               The warriors make a show of not acknowledging the FBI 
               presence. They have walked over here just to walk by them. 
               That is there statement. But Yellow Bird stops cranking the 
               wheels of his chair and stop: long enough to look up at Ray.

               Even the agents crack grins at this bit of Indian wit. All 
               but Ray who just stands there, arms folded across his chest, 
               considering the crippled activist.

                         Ray.

               Yellow Bird sits there, staring up at him through thick 
               glasses But then Maggie Eagle Bear takes the handles of Yellow 
               Bird's wheel chair. She looks at Ray with eyes that are choke-
               cherry black, eyes that look right through him. He returns 
               the glare. And then she pushes Yellowbird forward and leaves 
               the feds alone.

               Ray turns to Cooch who is lighting a cigarette, and 
               concentrating on the movements of this group as they wander 
               under the arbor, visiting people. LAKOTA SINGERS start up.

               the under ten year-old "fancy dance" -- TWENTY-FIVE INDIAN 
               CHILDREN, whirling and stomping and dancing.

<b>               JIMMY LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The battered old house sits under a full moon. The upside 
               down flag moves slightly in the cross winds.

<b>               ACROSS THE ROAD
</b>
               several junked cars. Among them a black, rusted out VW van 
               with a smashed windshield. A PACK OF RES DOGS sniff at its 
               tires.

<b>               INT. JIMMY'S VAN
</b>
               In the dim light, a boot. A black cowboy boot. Up on the 
               dash. Bluejeans. T-shirt. Second hand leather. And a black 
               cowboy hat. Ray is staking out Jimmy's house.

               Across the passenger seat and console is an M-16 rifle. On 
               his belt, a .357 Red Hawk. He yawns. From outside, he hears 
               a sound.

               POV: down below the van, a small, patchy RES DOG with a 
               missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and 
               salivating.

               RAY breaks off a piece of sandwich and drops it down to him 
               just as -- HEADLIGHTS catch his face. He slides down low, 
               watching an old pick-up truck creak onto the dirt road, 
               leading to Jimmy's.

               POV: the truck parks. Someone jumps out, gracefully. Indian. 
               Long braid. Quick steps. Front door. Inside.

               RAY lifts his radio.

                         him. Over.

               Ray sets his radio down, unclips the leather guard on his 
               handgun. Picks up the Big Mac.

<b>               EXT. LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The front door creaks open, and the subject dashes back out. 
               In the dark we cannot latch onto features.

               Suddenly the junker van comes alive, guns onto the dirt road, 
               racing toward the running Indian who gets the door of the 
               truck open but freezes in the van's highbeams as --

               Ray leaps out, M-16 in hand.

                         it, drop it!

               Ray maneuvers in Quantico fashion, keeping the rifle on the 
               Indian's back. The Indian drops what he's holding. And turns 
               around. It's not a he. We've seen her before. At the Powwow. 
               Maggie Eagle Bear. Her hair is pulled back tight, braided.

               Ray moves in toward her, surprised at first, but still 
               cautious

               She does what he tells her. As Ray moves in on her, he notices 
               an INDIAN CHILD sitting in the passenger seat, looking out 
               into the highbeams, frightened.

               Ray toes Maggie's legs out wider, frisks her one-handed, 
               pats down her boots.

</b>                         That's right. Turn around.

               Maggie turns around, looks Ray in the eye. He looks self-
               conscious in the cowboy hat.

               Ray is looking down at what she dropped. A bundle lying in 
               the grass. He bends down, starts to untie it.

               Cooch's Le Baron pulls in.

                         material. Something that indicates 
                         that our girl Maggie is leaking 
                         information to us. And make sure 
                         that material finds its way into the

               Sherman and Miles, take off. Cooch, an impressive master of 
               COINTELPRO, now turns to the van squad.

               Cooch, standing there with his glasses on and his right arm 
               bandaged, looks tired, too. He gets in his car.

               In the yard, Ray starts for the van, the res dog, trying to 
               follow. He chases it away. And then as he gets closer to the

               the old man comes down the front steps in a frail walk,

               that grow just off his trailer, and offers the plate up toward 
               the sky.

               He then stoops, and scrapes a half-eaten English muffin, 
               some potato chips and half a banana onto the Earth in a neat 
               pile.

               He straightens his back the best he can, looks up again, and

               a puppy chases a hen in a klutzy, innocent manner then bumps 
               into the tire of a parked car. Taking a shot at doghood, he 
               hikes his leg, squirts a hubcap belonging to --

               Cooch's Le Baron. Cooch leans on the hood, drinking a coffee

               a map spread out over the hood and are discussing it.

               hard this morning, catching the light of the sun. Maggie's 
               truck is parked in front.

               Out at the river, Maggie, her hair long and unbrushed, and 
               wearing an extra large T-shirt and nothing else is hauling 
               water in buckets from the river.

               THREE INDIAN CHILDREN are with her, helping her. Near the

               and a cat that gathers with the chickens and eats feed.

               Ray, still in his field clothes sits, training binoculars on 
               the distant house. He opens a carton of milk, drinks some. 
               Then hears a whimpering. In the passenger seat sits the three 
               legged res dog. Ray has taken him with him. He drinks some 
               milk, then opens the carton up fully and sticks it out so 
               the dog can lap it up. Ray laughs in disbelief, shaking his 
               head.

               The dog is lapping the milk, desperately. And then a ROARING. 
               A motorcycle.

               IN THE SIDE MIRROR: Crow Horse, racing up on the left of the 
               van. Ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back. The motorcycle 
               passes on the left, slowing enough so that Crow Horse can 
               flip Ray the middle finger. Then he races on, far down the 
               road.

               Ray sits there, shaking his head. He'll let it go. Bullshit. 
               He starts the car.

               A moment later, the van hammers in. Parks. Ray gets out. 
               He's removed his hat so as not to invite any crap from Crow

               it. His laughter simmers and he gets serious.

                         trailer, but the car came highballing 
                         at him. He started running for the 
                         open grass. With the car moving, 
                         Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, 
                         took aim -- missed once, hitting the 
                         shitter -- fired again, and severed 
                         Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and 
                         came to a stop in the grass. And

                         Our man made an effort to turn him 
                         over, onto his face. It's an old 
                         Ind'n belief that if a dead man is 
                         turned face down, his spirit won't 
                         leave. And in the killer's case, it 
                         won't come back and jump all over

               The two of them stand there, thinking this over. Ray takes 
               out his notebook and starts writing. Crow Horse walks away,

               To punctuate, Crow Horse slaps leather, draws his .38, and 
               begins blasting at the milk bottles. He hits the bank. A 
               tree. One of the posts. But not a single target.

                         I'm listening to the trees, to the 
                         stones. Who is it?

               Crow Horse turns toward Ray, and creates a long dramatic 
               pause.

               And he hauls his bulk onto his motorbike.

               Crow Horse winks at Ray as he slams the kickstart. To no

                         Goodbye.

               And Crow Horse nails his kick start. The BIKE ROARS alive 
               and the Indian works the throttle hard, leaving gravel and 
               black exhaust. Ray stands there, drifting between logic and 
               instinct. He looks at his watch, then starts at a slow, 
               thoughtful shuffle toward his car.

               The dust-buzzard broncs and bounces down Grandpa's driveway, 
               coming to a stop near the wrecked cars. Crow Horse dismounts 
               and unhooks a carton of smokes from the back.

               A moment later, the junker van pulls in, bouncing and shaking.

               Crow Horse stares at the approaching vehicle, his eyes hidden 
               behind Ray's former shades. He cracks a slow smile because --

               Ray is stepping quickly from the van, and carrying two packs 
               of Marlboros.

               Grandpa sits in his chair, his black eyes moving smoothly 
               from side to side. Smoke enshrouds his ancient face, giving 
               the sense of another time and place. He speaks LAKOTA.

               Crow Horse, sitting on a stool across from him, holds The 
               Pipe. He passes it to Ray who sits in a busted lawn chair 
               next to him. The room is dark as the sun sets out the window 
               in red and purple. Ray looks at the pipe. Grandpa will not 
               speak until Ray smokes. And so he does, drawing on the stem, 
               awkwardly.

               HEARTBEAT DRUM as Grandpa speaks Indian.

</b>                         He says, back behind Red Deer Table, 
                         where the Elk-People-used-to-live... 
                         there are strange creatures from 
                         another world who eat stones... and 
                         who will kill anyone who crosses 
                         into this place.

               Ray looks at Crow Horse, searching for a hint of lightness. 
               But there is only great reverence as he watches Ray blow 
               smoke upward.

<b>                                     CROW HORSE
</b>                         He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last 
                         night, he saw you... going back into 
                         the land beyond Red Deer Table. I 
                         was with you. But that was all the 
                         Spirits let him see so he doesn't 
                         know if you were killed or not. But 
                         he thinks you probably were.

               Ray smirks as he passes the pipe to Grandpa. Crow Horse looks 
               nervous. Grandpa offers the pipe to the directions and then 
               disengages the bowl from the stem. He speaks again. Crow 
               Horse translates.

               Grandpa leans closer to Crow Horse and whispers some Lakota.

                         Tell him this is an expensive watch.

               Crow Horse tells the Old Man. Grandpa speaks Indian.

                         your life anyway.

               Ray buries his hands in his jacket pocket. No way. Crow Horse 
               signs to Grandpa "no." Grandpa gets up, crosses between the 
               two young men, up to the TV set. He turns it on.

               Ray gets in and pulls the dog out. The dog sits at roadside, 
               tilting its head at him, confused. And he pulls out. It runs 
               after him.

<b>               EXT. DIRT ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S - RES - NIGHT
</b>
               The van sits parked down the road from Maggie's dimly-lit 
               home. Ray sits behind the wheel, watching the house. LOCUSTS 
               make a steady and unnerving sound. It is black. Black under 
               big sky. Ray lets his head sag out the open window and he 
               takes in the vastness.

               POV: stars. Millions of stars. And an incredible full moon. 
               It hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere. The top 
               half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red.

<b>               REVERSE - RAY

               stares at it, lost in thought. From Maggie's house, he hears 
               someone SINGING. Singing a traditional SUNDANCE SONG while 
               they haul water from the creek. A WOMAN'S VOICE, trilling 
               out the beautiful but haunting "hey-o-hey-o-hey-o-hey-ohhhhh."

               Ray just sits, listening. And then something draws his 
               attention to his rearview mirror.

               The res dog, lying in the back seat is GROWLING. Lip curled 
               back, growling low.

               Ray looks at him, looks out the window. Blackness. Nothing 
               but the sound of locusts. And a slight crosswind in the wheat 
               fields. The dog stops growling. And Ray fixes his gaze on 
               the house again, lifting a pair of binoculars and --

               BOOOOOOM! The rear windshield is SHATTERED by an explosion. 
               Ray throws himself low across the passenger seat -- BOOOOOM! 
               The driver's side window and part of the door explodes.

               soldier into tall wheat at roadside as the car, the road, 
               the wheat, the dirt, the night are slammed by gunfire.

               The res dog overtakes Ray and vanishes in the wheat. Ray 
               vanishes, too. It is quiet for a moment, then Ray, pops up 
               ten feet away, and UNLOADS THE M-16, in a left to right, 
               clean sweep before dropping again. He lies there, listening. 
               The LOCUST HAVE GONE QUIET. His breath is heavy. His heart's 
               got to be pounding through the dirt he lays in.

               into room 14. Ray hesitates, snagged by the sight of --

               A motorcycle parked in front of the Buffalo Butte Bar. Parked 
               with pick-up trucks and station wagons. It's the mud-caked 
               old Barley. Parked right under the NO INDIANS sign.

               He puzzles over this.

<b>               INT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - DAY
</b>
               Dark. Even during the day. Cigarette smoke. Sawdust. On the 
               archaic juke box, RANDY TRAVIS sings "Old 8x10" while behind 
               the bar, the BAR OWNER, an old man with long white hair and 
               beard, busies himself with leather work. SEVERAL WHITE LOCALS 
               sit on the old water drum bar stools.

               Heads lift, turn when Ray enters in his "fraternizing" clothes -- 
               jeans and boots, leather jacket. He scuffs up thick sawdust 
               as he heads to the furthest booth back where --

               Crow Horse sits, alone over a bourbon and a beer. Ray 
               approaches carefully, upset by the sight. He slides into the 
               booth and point blanks the Indian.

                         to be a medicine man but he won't go 
                         see the people. He says we changed,

                         wasn't there til the next day. Follow?

               Ray just looks vacantly at Crow Horse. Crow Horse resents 
               the vacancy.

                         And a good cop.

               Crow Horse leans toward Ray and speaks more quietly.

               Ray is fuming. He can't believe what he's hearing, what's 
               being insinuated, but he's giving it thought and it's getting 
               him angry. He smashes a hand down on the table.

               Standing over the booth is a long, tall RANCHER'S SON. Rangey 
               with red curly hair tucked under a BLACK HILLS CLASSIC cap, 
               and arms built by tractor work. And behind him, TWO OLDER 
               RANCHERS fall in. And ANOTHER YOUNG MAN, grinning with 
               amusement.

               Ray and Crow Horse look up.

               Ray realizes now that they think he's Indian, too. Crow Horse 
               sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking 
               LAKOTA to Ray.

               The rancher grabs Ray by the cheeks.

               Ray decks him. Backhands him in the solar plexus then, lays 
               a burner of a Quantico roundhouse to his ear, knocking him 
               across the bar, over a mop and bucket and into sawdust.

               The others start to fall at him but someone has jumped in, 
               holding them back, and sticking himself in the way. It is 
               Brooks. The old timer Ray met his first night here.

               The rancher's son who is coming back with a broken beer 
               bottle, slows his step and shifts his eyes from Brooks to 
               the young fed There is a lot of heavy breathing. But no 
               talking just yet. The young rancher eyes Ray.

               Ray just stands tense, staring at him. And it's strange. 
               Because he hasn't really looked like he has any Indian blood 
               up to this moment. But dressed the way he is, and his eyes 
               glaring, face drawing tense, he might pass for a breed 
               although that's probably the Italian. But Ray doesn't answer 
               the question. Crow Horse starts laughing. Drunkenly.

               Crow Horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor, 
               leaving the bar. Brooks is whispering to the others, 
               apparently about who Ray is. The bar man comes up to Ray, 
               holding a tray, on which sits a shot and a beer. Ray looks 
               at it for a moment.

               Ray knocks the tray out of his hand, spilling beer and whiskey 
               all over the bar man and the locals around him.

               And he walks out, leaving the locals confused.

               Maggie's old pick-up is parked near an arch gate of the tiny 
               cemetery where a tall monument is fenced off from other graves 
               There are tobacco offerings and other medicines hanging on 
               the fence and on the monument.

               It is a quiet place. Still.

               Maggie stands before the unkempt monument in her denim jacket, 
               her hair blowing across her face in the wind. She PRAYS IN

               Behind her TEN CHILDREN from the Bear Creek School stand,

               quietly with Maggie. When Maggie completes her prayer, she

               The CHILDREN LAUGH. All but one boy, who isn't paying

               Ray stands, watching Maggie walking into the wind, toward 
               him. Behind her an HONORING SONG, sung by ten children haunts 
               the still air.

               He doesn't budge as she mounts the gentle bluff and joins 
               him there.

               As she speaks, she begins digging her fingers in the earth.

               Maggie lifts herself onto her knees and looks down into the 
               small hole she's dug. She picks up a little pine cone.

               Maggie rises, dusting off her hands. She looks him in the

               Ray just stares at her, struggling with what he's feeling, 
               what he's hearing. What he's supposed to be feeling. Silence 
               hangs between the two of them.

               Maggie looks at him, considering. Then toward the long dark 
               silhouette of a mountain range across the plains.

</b>                         See those Black Hills out there, 
                         Ray? When the people lost the land 
                         in 1868, the government took 
                         everything but those hills. They 
                         allowed us to keep those Black Hills, 
                         to live there. Signed a treaty. Until 
                         they found gold. Then they told us 
                         we had to leave because of National 
                         interest. They broke that treaty. 
                         Anyone who fought or spoke out against 
                         it, wound up dead or in jail. And 
                         the people wound up here. On a 
                         reservation.

               While she looks off at Paha Sapa, Ray stares at her profile.

               Maggie is laughing as she looks back at the children who are 
               no longer singing. Ray reaches inside his jacket and takes 
               out five polaroids. He shuffles them as he ponders. He hands 
               one to Maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to 
               the Wasi'cu.

               Maggie looks at the first photo and says nothing. She hands 
               it back quickly. Ray won't take it.

               Maggie ignores him. Ray studies her reaction.

               Maggie is looking away. She picks a long blade of grass and 
               smoothes it in her hands.

               Ray looks at her a moment longer then rises, dusting off his 
               jeans, and standing there. He thinks for a long moment, 
               pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks out at the Black 
               Hills, pensive.

               Ray stops. She stands on the bluff, her hair riding the wind 
               and her eyes searing. And then her lips do something that 
               might qualify as half a smile. A sense of humor rising up 
               through anger. Survival humor.

               Ray looks at her for a long moment. And then he walks on, 
               leaving her there.

               Exhausted, Ray lays his head back on the seat, and lets a 
               long, constricted breath free. THUNDER ROLLS like the slow, 
               deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills. He opens his 
               eyes, looks out the window.

               POV: rain is coming down, and Maggie is getting the children 
               into the back of her truck. She helps them get a tarp over 
               their heads. Then as Yellow Bird pulls himself into the cab 
               of the truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it 
               in.

               She gets in, starts up, and rolls off down the sloping road.

               Ray steps out of the car into the rain and closes the door. 
               He stares at the burial grounds. Then slowly, he starts toward 
               them as if magnetically drawn. HEARTBEAT DRUM.

               A shroud of mist lays over the cemetery, growing thicker as 
               the rain falls harder. DRUM BEATS DEEPER. Ray is walking 
               toward the memorial, getting drenched. Then he hears something 
               strange. HOOFBEATS.

<b>               RAY'S POV:

               coming down the dirt road, toward him, a HORSEMAN drives his 
               mount at a fast trot. The rider is only a vague image in the 
               mist, his face hidden. As he rides closer, we can make out a 
               shotgun in his hand. And he throws it up, takes aim.

               not there. He's left it in the car. He breaks into a run. 
               But there's a shorter distance now between the horseman and 
               the car and Ray has no choice but to turn and flee.

               His boots slap wet pavement, and his breath draws heavy and 
               desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy 
               slope, looking over his shoulder, panicking.

               His legs and arms churning, his face contorted. And then 
               someone passes him out, running just as hard. AN INDIAN WOMAN 
               in 1890 Winter rags, clutching a BABY to her breast and 
               CRYING. SCREAMING. Ray looks at her, incredulous as he runs. 
               But he keeps running.

               The rider is right behind him. He FIRES. The GUNSHOT CRACKS

               window down, letting in THUNDER.

               Cooch starts to say something then takes note of Ray's peaked

               at sheet plastic in the windows. An ancient sewing wheel 
               CREAKS RUSTY in the wind.

               Three clean, late-model fed cars pull down the muddy drive 
               as two SWAT vehicles pull in from another road. The Le Baron 
               pulls in, and Ray bails out with the others. When he sees 
               where he is, he looks distraught.

               Agents are running behind junked cars, positioning themselves 
               around the trailer.

               The holy man is sitting in his chair, smacking Flies with a 
               swatter. Tonight he wears a black reservation hat and stares 
               vacantly at the TV where RONALD MACDONALD swings a giant 
               baseball bat, and falls on his face, bouncing back up. And 
               then BOOM!

               The door is open and Cooch leads Miles, Sherman and Ray 
               inside. Cooch has a gun on the old man.

               The old man slowly removes his hat and hangs it on a knee. 
               Carefully he places his wrinkled hands on his thinning white 
               hair. His eyes seek out Ray who stands in the doorway, M-16 
               in hand, looking concerned. He stares at Ray.

               Cooch storms into a back bedroom, Miles moves to a window. 
               Sherman stands over the old man.

</b>                         Where is he, Sam? Where's Jimmy?

               Grandpa looks at Sherman, ignores him, looks back at Ray.

                         That right, Sam?

               With RADIO TRANSMISSIONS crackling through the house, Cooch 
               comes back down the hall, and heads to the door.

</b>                         Trailer's clean, let's go.

               Ray starts to follow but he sees Sherman pick something up 
               from near Grandpa. The 500 year-old turtleshell rattle. 
               Grandpa's eyes widen slightly.

</b>                         Sherman!

               Sherman drops the turtleshell rattle on the linoleum floor. 
               Then drives his heel into it, CRUSHING the fragile 
               turtleshell.

               Ray grabs him and slams him into the tin wall. Miles gets 
               between them, grabbing Sherman.

               They're out the door, leaving the old man to sit looking 
               down at the shattered rattle. He closes his eyes.

               In a blizzard of rain, Jimmy Looks Twice in a cowboy shirt, 
               jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the Airstream, clutching 
               his medicine bundle. FLOODLIGHTS HIT him from all directions. 
               BULLHORNS screaming at him.

               He tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed. Ray, 
               having run out the back door has slammed right into him. He 
               has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a 
               split second before he is converged on. Guns at his back, at 
               his head.

               He is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked. He looks 
               up at Ray, desperately.

               Another fed, pushes his face into the mud, cuffs him behind 
               his back.

               With two FIVE MAN SWAT TEAMS swarming the area, and six agents 
               pushing Jimmy toward a car, Cooch stands there in the pouring 
               rain, looking relieved. Ray stands near him, looking abhorred.

</b>                         Damn. That's one hard running Indian.

               Ray watches Jimmy as he is shoved into the back of Miles and 
               Sherman's car and driven away. He is twisting around in his 
               seat to look at Ray. Desperately. The SWAT teams disband, 
               return to their vehicles.

                         look like I'm ready for the advisory 
                         desk. Let's go get a beer.

               Cooch heads to his car and Ray starts shuffling toward his 
               as if he is dared by it all. He is looking at the trailer 
               and there on the rickety porch is Grandpa. He comes down the 
               steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind. He watches 
               the cars pulling out.

               Ray walks over to him, looking sick.

                         I'm sorry.

               And after a moment of locking gazes, he starts for his car,

                         called Wounded Knee.

               Ray turns.

</b>                         I was one years old there when our 
                         people were shot down. My mother hid 
                         me in the snow in a blanket. One of 
                         those killed was a Holy Man called 
                         Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart. They 
                         killed him while he was running for 
                         The Stronghold. It is his blood -- 
                         the same blood that spilled on the 
                         grass and snow at Wounded Knee -- 
                         that runs through your heart like a 
                         buffalo.

               Ray frowns, disturbed by this story.

               The old man is speaking with conviction. With power.

<b>                                     GRANDPA

                         That's what I am told. Maybe you're 
                         right and I am mistaken. Your mind

                         more.

               Ray stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this. He turns and 
               looks into the old man's sharp eyes. Grandpa has closed his 
               eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face 
               toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to SING 
               IN LAKOTA. And it is too much. Too weird. He wheels and 
               hurries to the car. Gets in, and beats a fast path out of 
               the old man's lonesome patch of land.

               BLUE HEAT LIGHTNING knifes the sky. THUNDER ROLLS, and rumbles 
               into POOL BALLS --

               The agents have taken over both sides of the streets, gathered 
               in front of the bar and the motel, putting firearms into 
               cases, removing flak jackets.

               POOL BALLS knock from inside the bar while outside, A DAKOTAN 
               takes a piss near a truck while his GIRLFRIEND stands at his 
               back, yelling at him. CHARLIE DANIELS sings country on the 
               juke Ray heads to room 13, starts unlocking the door. Cooch 
               comes up behind him.

               Cooch throws a mock punch at Ray and he mock blocks, tired. 
               He musters a smile. But he isn't all there.

               Ray nods. Cooch lets a few agents walk past, LAUGHING. He 
               speaks quietly.

               Cooch stares at Ray. The younger agent looks like he indeed 
               has a fever.

               Cooch hurries across the rain-swept street. Ray steps inside 
               and closes the door.

<b>               INT. ROOM 13 - BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL

               Ray closes the door, and stands there. He seems to be having 
               trouble breathing. He looks down at his boots. There is 
               something on the floor. Something that has been slipped under 
               the door earlier. He just stares down at it. Then slowly 
               stoops.

               CLOSE ON: the polaroid of the res car he gave to Maggie 
               earlier. She

               has returned it. He turns it over. Written across the white 
               backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name -- 
<b>               YELLOW BIRD.
</b>
               Ray stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes 
               of files on the bed. He rummages like a nervous thief and 
               comes up with a folder. He flips through it, casting off 
               files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on --

               The 8x10 BLACK AND WHITE of Richard Yellow Bird seen earlier. 
               Sitting in his wheelchair, Red Power cap on, tattoos marring 
               big arms. And under it a DOUBLE MUG SHOT stamped LEAVENWORTH 
               PRISON. Under that ANOTHER PRISON MUG SHOT stamped SIOUX 
               FALLS PRISON. And under that a --

               THIRD MUG SHOT stamped "PAROLED."

               Ray, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits 
               on the end of the bed. He then stuffs the file back in a 
               box, and takes off toward the door.

               waistband. He starts for the shack. Ray raps a fist on the 
               splintered plywood door. Knocks again. He checks out a boarded-
               up window. The door finally opens. Just a crack. Tiny black 
               eyes peer out into the fading light.

               Ray sticks his open badge, gold eagle wings, near the crack. 
               The door closes. Then unlatches and opens. Yellow Bird sits 
               there in his wheelchair, tiny tobacco bundles in his lap. 
               He's been tying them.

               Ray sits in a busted chair, reaches down to his ankle holster 
               and pulls out a .38. He holds it, resting it on the arm of 
               the chair. He strains to look out through the boarded window. 
               Yellow Bird fidgets in his chair.

               Ray is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this 
               confession, at this understanding of the machinery. He sits 
               there with his gun, blinking away sweat that beads at his 
               brow. Yellow Bird is weeping in a highpitched voice that 
               doesn't match his great bulk.

               And then HEADLIGHTS pierce the gaps in the boarded windows. 
               Yellow Bird collapses against the wall, bangs his head off 
               it. He lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath 
               and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor.

               Ray peers out the cracks in the boards.

               Ray gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door. 
               He stops and looks back at the Indian, sitting on the floor, 
               clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker.

<b>               EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - NIGHT

               Ray steps out into the falling night. There is a car parked 
               there. With a high aerial. Ray raises a hand in a slight 
               wave, walks on. At the fed car, A REGIONAL AGENT behind the 
               wheel, waves a hand. Watches Ray get into the Le Baron.

               Ray gets in the car and takes off.

<b>               LE BARON - TRAVELING

               Ray drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation. 
               Through miles of open land and strange rock formations. And 
               he looks trapped. HEADLIGHTS flicker in his rearview. He 
               sees this. Slams the gas pedal.

<b>               EXT. RES ROADS - NIGHT

               The Le Baron races at 85 down the dirt stretch. A moment 
               later a car rattles by at 90.

<b>               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING
</b>
               Ray reaches over to the passenger seat and pulls up the M-
               16. He lays it across his lap. Looks in the rearview again. 
               Then makes a sudden sharp turn.

               He pulls off the road quickly, throwing up dust into the 
               already foggy night, the car goes out of control.

<b>               EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT
</b>
               The car that was following drives right past the narrow layby, 
               hidden by grassy slopes and keeps flying down the long 
               stretch.

<b>               INT. LE BARON

               Ray skids through the dirt, trying to stop -- he can't -- 
               and the Le Baron fishtails, smashing into a chain-link fence. 
               And coming to a stop.

               Breathing as if he's been running not driving, Ray looks 
               behind him to make sure he lost the car. He did. When he 
               turns back to his wheel, he sees --

<b>               THROUGH THE CHAINLINK FENCE
</b>
               lit by his headlights: THE WOUNDED KNEE gravesite. He is 
               right up on the arch, and the tall stone marker beyond it.

<b>               EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT
</b>
               The Le Baron just sits parked, headlights making the night 
               fog crawl up from the base of the old tomb, along the fence.

               The driver's door opens slowly. And Ray steps out. He walks 
               through the arch. Into the small fenced area. Up to the stone 
               which is overgrown with stubborn weeds, half-hidden in mist. 
               Ray studies the tomb.

<b>               POV: THE NAMES ON THE STONE ARE CHISELED VERTICALLY:

</b>
<b>               AFRAID OF BEAR
</b>
               Weeds are grown up over the rest of the names. Ray's hands 
               clear them, grab at them and rip them away from more names:

<b>               PRETTY HAWK
</b>
<b>               BLUE AMERICAN
</b>
<b>               SHERMAN HORN CLOUD
</b>
               With frantic abandon, Ray is ripping weeds away. He drops to 
               his knees, clearing weeds.

<b>               STRONG FOX
</b>
<b>               THUNDER HEART
</b>
               MOVING DOWN and then suddenly back up to the name:

<b>               THUNDER HEART
</b>
<b>               REVERSE ON - RAY
</b>
               kneeling in the weeds, the wind getting restless around him, 
               screaming the way plains winds do but only these winds are 
               filled with a whistling. What sounds like EAGLE BONE WHISTLES, 
               piping shrill.

               Ray kneels before the marker, staring at the name on the 
               stone, his hair thrown around by the wind that drives across 
               the grass, whistling eagles, building to an unbearable, pitch.

               Ray stares at the name as if he is looking through a small 
               hole into another world. A world that frightens him. He gets 
               up and backs away from the stone, through the gate. And gets 
               back in his car, quickly. He takes off.

<b>               EXT. MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The little home on the river. Dark. Empty. Ray runs up the 
               steps, pounds at the door. No answer. Pounds again.

               He keeps knocking. Nothing. He hurries back down the steps, 
               starts around the back of the house and something attacks 
               him, leaps at him from the dark, knocking him off his feet, 
               into the grass. Hits him again.

               But as quickly as he falls, he rolls, throwing up his hands 
               and blocking a savage kick aimed for his face. He traps the

               matter of seconds, he is on top of the man, sticking his gun 
               in his throat. He grabs a flashlight from his jacket and 
               shines it in the man's face.

               Crow Horse. Breathing like a wild animal.

               Ray and Crow Horse are quiet as they eat up the dirt roads.

                         a dream that I was being chased. And 
                         I was running with other people. Old-
                         fashion Indian people. I got shot in 
                         the back. Like Leo.

               When Crow Horse doesn't respond, Ray looks over and finds 
               him staring. He looks back to the road. And when he looks 
               back at Crow Horse, he is still staring at him.

               Ray brakes. Crow Horse is looking past him. Ray turns. The 
               spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise, 
               looms massive now that we are under it. Moonlight falls on 
               it. And the HEARTBEAT DRUM pulses from it.

<b>               EXT. WHERE-THE-ELK-PEOPLE-USED-TO-LIVE - NIGHT
</b>
               The land behind Red Deer Table is Badlands. Badlands pierced 
               by a few rutted old wagon roads. At a place between two 
               grotesque buttes, Crow Horse stops, looking uneasy.

               He digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and 
               spills it on the ground. Then he walks on.

               Ray observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough 
               to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to 
               Crow Horse's offering.

<b>               THROUGH THE BADLANDS
</b>
               Ray and Crow Horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning 
               the area. Crow Horse stops, checks out some tracks. Ray walks 
               on, looking up at the table. He shines his flashlight up and 
               it illuminates --

               A RED RIBBON, tied on stakes on a ridge. Ten stakes. Twenty 
               stakes. Ribbons blowing in the wind.

               Ray sweeps the light along, walking faster, and then something 
               frightening occurs. Something... some unseen thing snags him 
               by the leg, sucking him into the Earth with a horrible GUSHING 
<b>               SOUND.

               Ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish-black slime, 
               oozing out around him. Crow Horse grabs him, struggling to 
               pull him up. He does, stumbling back and stepping into a 
               hole himself.

               The two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around, 
               slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their 
               bearings.

               Ray touches the ground where a blue-black chemical solution 
               oozes out with water from the aquifer below. His flashlight 
               scans --

               TWENTY DRILLED HOLES IN THE EARTH. A uranium strip-mining 
               grid laid out in a 50 x 60 pattern. The far side is fenced

               Ray goes to another hole and sticks his arm in up to the 
               elbow, sniffs the solution.

               Ray is looking past Crow Horse at --

               Something strange in the moonlight. COYOTES. Some forty yards 
               away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground. Six Coyotes, dancing 
               in the shadows of rock formations. MOVING IN ON THEM as Ray 
               walks forward, they circle... scatter... run back... circle 
               again. Look straight at Ray, eyes glowing.

               And run.

<b>               REVERSE - RAY

               and Crow Horse walk toward them. To the place they just left. 
               A place in the dirt, they were digging up. When they reach 
               it, they stare down into the dirt.

               hair, thrown into tangles and dirt. It was buried. Until the 
               coyote caught wind. Crow Horse bends down, touches the 
               jacket... turns the body over And almost vomits when he sees 
               Maggie Eagle Bear.

               Ray steps back, his boots squishing in solution and sealant 
               and soiled water. He covers his mouth, stopping himself from 
               getting sick. And then he explodes, YELLING.

               A DOG BARKS hollow as the Crow Horse motorcycle chutters 
               down and coasts up in front of one of the little homes -- 
               rundown but it has a satellite dish and a decent car like so

               Crow Horse walks over to Ray's window, his jeans and boots 
               muddy. No one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by 
               crickets. And that one dog.

               Crow Horse crosses the street. Ray sits there, and he looks 
               almost hurt by this statement. But he is the white man. But 
               he is Indian. He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple. 
               He takes out a smoke. Tries to light it. His hands are shaking 
               too badly. But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in

               Oliver Clear Moon sits in a chair, his strong Indian mouth, 
               beginning to tighten at the jowls.

               Across from him, Crow Horse sits on the edge of a couch. 
               MRS. CLEAR MOON, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee. 
               A TEENAGE GIRL in a men's extra-large T-shirt stands in the 
               hall, looking at him.

               Clear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand, 
               starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen. He loses 
               control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the 
               room into the sink, smashing it. He wheels and faces Crow 
               Horse. He SPEAKS LAKOTA. Asking questions. Crow Horse SPEAKS 
               LAKOTA. Answering him.

               Mrs. Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief 
               and her eyes begin to well. Oliver, walking back to his chair, 
               sits, and thinks for a moment. MORE LAKOTA. He gets up, goes 
               to a drawer and rummages. He sits again, and tosses something 
               onto the coffee table. It is a badge. A tribal police badge.

               Crow Horse looks at Ray who stares dead ahead.

<b>               EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - RES - DAWN
</b>
               The shack is just as Ray left it earlier, kerosene flickers 
               dancing yellow through the gapped boards. Ray and Crow Horse 
               with guns drawn, approach the front door.

                         We did an honorin' song for him and

                         out without a fight.

               Crow Horse snakes around toward the rear of the shack.

               Ray knocks at the front door. It is unlatched and it creaks 
               open a little. Ray pushes it open and sees --

               An empty wheelchair.

               Ray steps away from the door, looking around the vast plains 
               as the sun comes up out of the Black Hills. He is roadblocked, 
               and it shows in his eyes. It's all getting too big.

               Crow Horse leans against the shack, watching Ray. And then 
               RADIO STATIC from inside the Le Baron. Ray pivots and stares 
               at it as if someone is inside the car. His call signal is 
               being paged. But he just stands there, looking at it.

               Ray reaches inside the car and lifts the handset. He takes a 
               breath before pressing it to his lips.

               clears his throat.

               of the car toward the Black Hills.

               Ray swings in behind the wheel, starts the car, and barrels 
               off recklessly down the rutted road, leaving Crow Horse 
               behind.

               The Le Baron is already out to where sight reaches farther 
               than sound and silent white dust mushrooms skyward.

<b>               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING

               A RAVEN is sentinel on a telephone wire that crosses the 
               road from the bar to motel. A few trucks remain parked in 
               front of the joint.

               Ray approaches room 13, looking shell-shocked. His boots 
               leave blue mud prints all the way to the door. He unlocks 
               it.

<b>               INT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - ROOM

               Ray has cast off his field clothes and is halfway into one 
               of his cleaner suits. He looks haggard but still buoyant, 
               his eyes piercing. The connecting door creaks open and Cooch 
               walks in. The SAC is freshly showered and he is fidgeting 
               with a Windsor knot. He studies his number two man, says 
               nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down. 
               His face is a red hue.

                         Couldn't sleep, Ray?

               Ray looks at Cooch. When he speaks, his voice is dry.

               Cooch crosses the room, and picks up Ray's jeans which look 
               like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole. 
               Ray tucks his clean shirt in; watching Cooch.

                         Horse.

               Cooch walks up to Ray slowly and takes his face in his hand, 
               turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his 
               left eye, a residual from a Crow Horse hook.

               Ray nods, and Cooch slowly breaks a smile. An insecure smile 
               but a smile just the same. He starts to laugh.

               Cooch laughs in amusement and Ray's face crinkles into a 
               grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his 
               face. And then, suddenly, Ray lunges at Cooch.

               He slams the Agent in Charge against the hollow wall, and 
               holds him there. His eyes wild.

               Cooch suddenly explodes, throwing Ray off of him and sending 
               him reeling back against the sink. He points a finger at his

               Cooch's eyes go frighteningly cold. He can't believe what

               Ray turns to the sink, turns the faucet on to get some water 
               on his face. The water only trickles into the basin.

               free. He shuts it off. Turns to look at Cooch. And it is 
               then the door opens -- some knocking after the door is already

               here? What about the council fire? Ray somehow nods. Then 
               walks on to the Le Baron. Cooch gets behind the wheel of the

               for the big engines coming up fast behind him.

               Ray is leaving little transitional developments and trailers 
               behind. His eyes bore into the road before him, looking for 
               a sign of Crow Horse, and in the rearview for a sign of his 
               FBI mentor.

<b>               EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES - BADLANDS
</b>
               Crow Horse has the throttle open. But the two cars are coming 
               up on both sides, trying to sandwich him. To his right the 
               Badlands loom deep, a drop into a caliche netherworld of 
               jagged rock.

               He throws the bike right, trying to ride the thin ribbon of 
               shoulder.

</b>
               floors it, and swipes him, and the bike goes over the edge, 
               launched into --

<b>               THE BADLANDS
</b>
               where it does a violent triple flip, throwing Crow Horse 
               then smashing into a tent shaped dune.

<b>               A RIFLE
</b>
               sticks out from a window and punches the Badlands with THREE

               The Le Baron rifles past the abandoned horse trailer. Black 
               smoke drifts in a wind ahead.

               Ray veers onto the shoulder, barely gets the car in park 
               before bailing and running wildly down into the Badlands.

               Ray runs, stumbles through the rock and gypsum, searching 
               the area. He runs around the burning motorcycle, looking 
               left and right.

               lies on his back in the Badlands, eyes open, fixed unmoving 
               on the sky. Ray comes out of the flame-waves, running with 
               his .45 held high. He throws himself to his knees beside the 
               injured Indian.

               Crow Horse rolls his eyes toward the FBI agent. He has a 
               gash behind his ear, and pink sand clings to the blood. He 
               lifts his head, tries to form words.

               Ray gets an arm under the big Indian, helps him up out of a 
               jagged crevice.

               The Le Baron fish-tails in a cloud of dust and Ray leaps out 
               of the car, runs toward the little trailer, gun in hand. The 
               windows are all busted, and the door is wide open. Ray runs 
               in. Then straight back out, shaking his head to Crow Horse.

               Crow Horse hangs his head out the passenger window.

               Ray takes the mic and for some reason, he's putting it inside 
               his jacket near his shoulder where he keeps his leather. 
               Crow Horse looks at him, puzzled. And then the sound comes 
               forth, the static crackling of a micro-cassette recorder.

               Ray keeps the tape running into the radio as he drives through 
               rugged Badlands. Crow Horse, stunned by the voice, eyes Ray 
               as the tape rolls.

               POV: The Stronghold -- a narrow opening in hulking rock

               a rifle. And PAST HER, ANOTHER. TRADITIONAL PEOPLE, many 
               from the trading post porch, rise to the edge, armed. Silent.

               Twenty, twenty-five, thirty traditionals, forming a line

               hats, some just long hair blowing in the wind. Fifty, sixty, 
               SEVENTY-FIVE RESERVATION PEOPLE forming a circle on the rocks; 
               it's Little Big Horn revisited. A fourteen year-old boy 
               struggles to keep a huge shotgun at his shoulder.

               Clear Moon's mouth is as dry as Badlands soil. Cooch is 
               panicking, his eyes running along the high edge.

<b>               RAY
</b>
               stands equally astonished, assessing the back-up.

<b>               CROW HORSE
</b>
               lifts himself, stands, taking in the sight.

<b>               AT THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE
</b>
               stepping stiffly but steadily through the line of armed 
               locals, pushing his way to the very edge so as to look down, 
               Grandpa Sam Reaches. The wind makes feathery tails out of 
               his long thinning strips of white hair.

<b>               DOWN BELOW
</b>
               Ray looks up at the old man, then turns to face Cooch.

<b>                                     RAY
</b>                         You're right, Cooch. It's over.

               Cooch slowly, lets the bullhorn fall. Then the rifle. He 
               looks back at Sherman who does the same, and all the way 
               down the line, everyone dropping their arms under the threat 
               of a lot more guns from above. And now Ray walks forward, 
               collecting his gun. Anderson Chasing Hawk, one of the 
               Warriors, runs down to Ray, breathless.

                         two more fed cars tryin' to get in. 
                         And some press.

               Ray notices that Cooch is staring at him, hard. He shakes 
               his head slowly. Strongly.

<b>                                     COOCH

</b>                         Let the press through.

               Chasing Hawk takes off, running, and Cooch watches in 
               consternation. Ray just stands eye to eye with him, holding 
               his ground.

               And along the ridge, Grandpa and the locals don't budge, 
               watching every move.

               CLIMBING HIGHER, we rise above the circle of proud Sioux to 
               see, on the inside of the Stronghold, thirty old trucks and 
               res cars.

               CLIMBING HIGHER into and through the fast-moving clouds that 
               the Lakota call The Grandfathers as the HEARTBEAT DRUM and 
               LAKOTA SINGERS takes over all sound.

               The HIGH WINDS of THREE MEDIA HELICOPTERS are delighting a 
               storm of Indian children and BARKING DOGS, running through 
               the streets past junked cars on blocks.

               Over on a little plot of grass and dirt, a pair of hands are 
               digging a small hole. Ray lays a pine cone in the hole and 
               looks down at it for a moment... before hand-plowing the 
               dirt back over it and patting it flat. He rises, knocking 
               dirt off his knees and hands.

               Crow Horse walks over, bandaged and favoring wounds, and Ray 
               falls in with him, walking down the middle of the village 
               road. His eyes are tired. But hopeful.

                         They wanna vote for Jimmy.

               Ray nods, encouraged as they walk along. His eyes follow the 
               helicopters.

               They reach the dusty, dented Le Baron and stand there, looking 
               at each other.

</b>                         Indian time.

               Crow Horse offers a hand to Ray. He takes it in a white man's 
               shake then follows Walter's cue into the Indian "allies" 
               grip and slap. They hold it there, looking into each other's 
               eyes.

               Ray ponders for a moment.

</b>                         I'll have to see what the visions

               Ray shrugs. Crow Horse discreetly gestures below his belt.

               Ray cracks a smile, a long time coming.

               Ray stands looking at him, searching for words.

               Ray goes to get in his car. But he sees someone sitting across 
               the street on the trading post porch. The old man.

               Ray considers him for a moment then walks over. They lock 
               eyes. Grandpa stares at Ray as if he's never seen him before, 
               and then arcs a brow. He touches his sleeve at the wrist. 
               Ray rolls his sleeve back to reveal his Rolex. Grandpa smiles 
               and Ray strips it off. He hands it to the old man and his 
               face crinkles into caliche earth.

               Grandpa holds the watch up in the light, admires it then 
               puts it in his shirt pocket. He moves a flat hand through 
               the air in the "done deal" sign language. Ray, a little 
               surprised that he gets nothing in the trade, returns the 
               smile and walks away.

               He gets to his car and wipes away two inches of dust from 
               the broken windshield.

<b>               INT. LE BARON

               After THREE TRIES, he gets the engine started. He pulls his 
               gun off his waistband, goes to lay it on the passenger seat 
               and finds something there.

               Grandpa's sacred caanunpa. The Pipe. Symbol of truth. Ray 
               looks out the window at the old man who is watching him with 
               those sharp black eyes. Ray lifts his hand, holds it flat, 
               and does the Sioux done deal sign.

               The Le Baron eats up the dirt road at a moderate, gravel 
               crunching pace. It slows as it passes Maggie Eagle Bear's 
               quiet home on the river. Children walk with the old woman, 
               carrying buckets from the river.

               The Le Baron slows to a crawl, then drives on.

               THE LE BARON driving off the res, under big sky as it ascends

               horses in the road and rolls on toward the reservation line 
               where the sun throws shadows that look like an old man 
               dancing.

               where West goes to Rapid City, and East back to Bear Creek, 
               Ray stops like the bullet-punched sign orders. He doesn't go 
               West. Doesn't go East. He sits there. Fishes a smoke out 
               from a pocket, clicks a lighter, and fires up. He sits there, 
               smoking.

               Deliberating.
