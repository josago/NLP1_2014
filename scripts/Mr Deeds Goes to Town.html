</b>                         I'll give it a lot of thought. There 
                         was a fellow named Winslow here a little 
                         while ago, wanted to handle my affairs 
                         for nothing too. It puzzles me why these 
                         people all want to work for nothing. 
                         It isn't natural. So I guess I'd better 
                         think about it some more.

                         thank you for making me Chairman.

</b>                         Longfellow, exiting his bedroom, wearing 
                         a coat and hat. He comes to the top 
                         of a grand staircase, looks around slyly 
                         and sees that no one is watching. He 
                         slides down the bannister and touches 
                         the statue at the bottom for good luck.

                         playing his tuba. She tells of his attacks 
                         upon several of our eminent writers 
                         - for no apparent reason. In fact, there

                         up without provocation.

</b>                         That's a name we made up back home for 
                         people who make foolish designs on paper 
                         when they're thinking. It's called doodling. 
                         Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you 
                         ever see a scratch pad in a telephone 
                         booth? People draw the most idiotic 
                         pictures when they're thinking. Dr. 
                         Von Holler, here, could probably think 
                         up a long name for it, because he doodles 
                         all the time.

                         of some doodling, flinches. A roar of 
                         laughter comes from the spectators. 
                         Longfellow reaches over to where Dr. 
                         Von Holler sits and picks up a piece 
                         of paper.

                         first place. I didn't invite anybody. 
                         Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just 
                         came to see what kind of a freak the 
                         "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how 
                         people like that are supposed to act, 
                         Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman 
                         is an example, I'll stick to simple 
                         folks. She just came in, talked my ear 
                         off, and took charge of everything. 
                         If I were a friend of hers, I'd have 
                         her examined.

                         lie about a thing like that, but I was

                         were younger, of course.

                         the other morning I read in the paper 
                         about Mr. Cedar's own son - about how 
                         he got drunk and insisted on driving 
                         a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside. 
                         Isn't that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn't that 
                         so , Mr. Cedar?

</b>                         Now, my plan is very simple. I was going 
                         to give each family ten acres - a horse, 
                         a cow and some seed. And if they work 
                         the farm for three years, it's theirs. 
                         Now, if that's crazy, maybe I ought 
                         to be sent to an institution. But I 
                         don't think it is. And what's more, 
                         Mr. Cedar doesn't either.

                         up. He runs toward her, and swoops her 
                         up in his arms.

                         one passionately back.
