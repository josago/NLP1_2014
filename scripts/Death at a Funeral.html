          TIGHT SHOT on AARON (CHRIS ROCK) thirties, dressed in a black
          suit and tie. He looks straight ahead with a somber expression.
          The camera pulls back to reveal he is watching FOUR UNDERTAKERS
          (INCLUDING BRIAN) place a coffin on a raised platform.

          braces himself for what he's about to see. The coffin opens and
          Aaron stares long and hard at the body.

</b>          Okay. I had to buy the seat next to
          me because I don't trust the airlines
          with my bags. And there was a lot of
          turbulence... I guess that's the
          thing about flying first class. It
          doesn't matter how much you pay if the
          plane crashes, you still end up dead--
          uh...
          Ryan realizes what he's said and stops speaking abruptly. It's
          too much for Cynthia who rushes upstairs.

</b>          I'd like to start with a favorite
          passage of Edwards from First Samuel
          chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the King
          James Bible.

<b>                         (READING)

          an end of speaking unto Saul, that the
          soul of Jonathan was knit with the
          soul of David, and Jonathan loved him
          as his own soul. And Saul took him
          that day, and would let him go no more
          home to his father's house..."
          While the reverend is talking, Norman pokes Elaine on the
          shoulder and leans forward.

          he's dead.

          was born in 1938. He grew up in
          Alabama on a farm. He loved to take
          long walks in the woods with his close
          friend, Bobby. He told me how they

          bikes through the fields and swimming
          in the lake.

          eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can I
          do?"
          Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted
          with pain. He looks like he's going to burst.

</b>          .He said he was a nice man, and
          surprisingly well dressed. When Dad
          was eighteen, he left home after an
          argument with his father. He never
          told me what that argument was about,
          but I do know that after leaving South
          Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch
          and never saw each other again. Dad
          went to college where he studied
          accounting, a decision which lead to a
          career in corporate finance... But
          his real passion was for the arts,
          with a particular fondness for
          theatre, dance and musicals. He was a
          charter member of the Negro Ensemble
          Company and contributed regularly to
          the Alvin Ailey School of Dance.

          Aaron remembers where he is and looks at Ryan. They rush off to
          the study, passing Jeff. Jeff checks his pockets and realizes
          the pills are gone again. He goes off to find them.

          Aaron and Ryan enter the study and head toward the closed
          bathroom door. They open it and find Uncle Russell sitting on
          the toilet.

<b>                         UNCLE RUSSELL

</b>          I'm so sorry, Uncle Russell. There
          was someone on the roof--

<b>                         UNCLE RUSSELL
</b>          Never mind that. What about that dead
          body you dragged in here?
          Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance.

          Norman sniffs his fingers, worried. In the background we see
          Elaine entering the room with Oscar, now dressed, but still
          looking a bit wired. People respond with scattered applause and
          congratulations.
          Derek walks over and joins Norman.

</b>          Did you hear that? She's having a
          kid!
          Derek looks at Norman who's looking sort of distant.

          more worried about Hepatitis C after
          having Uncle Russell's shit in my

          Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek
          confused.
          ANGLE ON: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle. He
          gives up and sits in a chair.
          ANGLE ON: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the room as Aaron
          moves to his seat.

          Ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle
          Russell's a bit mad and shouldn't be listened to.
          ANGLE ON: Michelle comes over to Aaron.

          Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and
          appearing flustered.

          Hey, you, sit down.
          People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to squeeze in next
          to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia throws
          Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her.

<b>          REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
</b>          (speaking very quickly)
          I'd like to apologize on behalf of the
          family for all of the distractions. I
          hope that everyone is settled and
          ready to continue with the service.
          Aaron, the oldest son, would like to
          say a few words about his father.
          Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to
          the front.
          Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is
          absolutely silent. He takes a deep breath.
          ANGLE ON: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up.
          ANGLE ON: Aaron.

          stares at it in stunned silence. Jeff looks over to Norman
          whose eyes are as wide as saucers. Aaron looks like a deer
          caught in headlights. He looks at Ryan who gestures to him to
          continue. He nervously struggles on.

          Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder
          as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling
          incoherently.
          Several people scream. Frank opens the other end of the coffin
          and looks at his dead lover.

</b>          No! No!
          Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room. As he
          passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet.
          As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks
          up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face turns to
          horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is
          broken by Cynthia's furious cry. She drops the photos and runs
          at Frank.

          they lived. Who never cast
          disparaging remarks or held prejudices
