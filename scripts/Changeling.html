</b>          A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE
          COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to
          shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves
          OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.

</b>          She throws water on her face as the music continues. She
          looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead.
          She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day.
          The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she
          smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.

          is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see
          much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's
          important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the

          and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.

          an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that
          only a few other kids have arrived.

</b>          She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward
          the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the
          school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as
          Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there.

          rumbles away.

</b>          Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room
          is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy
          wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening
          and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.
<b>          
</b>          Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created
          by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator
          to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns
          at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane
          toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.

          gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine

          we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows
          indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun.

                     that trauma can affect the growth
                     of children. Given the stress of
                     the last four months his spine may
                     have actually shrunk. It's uncommon,

                     is hygienically sound. Must have
                     been quite traumatic at the time.

          Another of them goes to "Walter," who is shorter than he is.

                       that his mental lapse may be the
                       result of a blow to the head or a
                       sudden shock which brought about a
                       possible cranial injury. I believe
                       that this condition will pass soon.

                       separated by a small muscle. Made

                       But the muscle between Walter's
                       teeth prevents that from happening.
                       They can never come together without
                       an operation to sever the muscle,
                       and I can tell you right now that
                       he has never had such an operation.

</b>                     Good morning. My name is Christine
                     Collins. On March 10th, my nine
                     year old son, Walter Collins,
                     disappeared. A four month

                     being brought to Los Angeles from
                     De Kalb, Illinois. They told me,
                     and all of you, that this boy was
                     my son. They were wrong.
                         (beat)
                     The Los Angeles Police Department
                     made a mistake...a terrible mistake.
                     The boy they found is not my son.
                     That is the reason for the supposed
                     "transformation." I have letters
                     from his dentist, his teachers and
                     others confirming that this boy is
                     not my son. The letters are being
                     reprinted now, and I should have
                     them for you tomorrow.

                     every opportunity to admit their
                     mistake and renew the search for my
                     son. Since they have refused to do
                     so, I have no choice but to present
                     my case before the public. I hope
                     this will persuade the police to
                     finish the job they started, and
                     bring my son home to me.

</b>          Gordon grabbing an ax.    Raising it.
<b>

          Steele passes down them in review. Stops in front of

          bloodshot...but still defiant. He glances to the orderlies.

          Christine, who shares a glance with Carol. Several other

          to the orderly, who starts to undo the straps that hold

                     sentence. So "incompetent," as in --
                         (reads)
                     "A department so incompetent that
                     they never realized that up to twenty
                     children were being kidnapped and
                     murdered under their very noses."
                         (looks over)
                     And here: "So incompetent that they
                     insisted they knew better than a
                     mother the identity of her own child,
                     forced him upon her, and then
                     incarcerated her when she confronted
                     them with evidence of their own
                     reprehensible behavior." That was
                     a two-fer. Incompetent and
                     reprehensible in the same sentence.

                     do that is to stop insisting that
                     Walter Collins was not among those
                     kids killed up at that goddamned
                     ranch. Because if the boy you
                     brought back isn't Walter Collins,
                     and he's not dead up at that ranch,

                     But if, on the other hand, he is,
                     or could be among those poor boys
                     killed up in Wineville...then the
                     inquiries stop. It's a momentary
                     embarrassment that you'll have to
                     live with...but better a short
                     inconvenience than a lingering

                     he was up at that ranch or not, the
                     truth is he probably is dead
                     somewhere. Better his mother accepts

          fleeing across an adjoining rooftop.

          blowing furiously. He looks behind him to see the other two
          Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast.
<b>          
</b>          Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance

</b>          Gordon makes another leap. The Mountie jumps...but he's short.
          He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs
          back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to
          shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free --
<b>          
</b>          -- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back
          off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then
          grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming.
<b>          
</b>          Gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be
          jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction --
<b>          
</b>          -- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard. The two go down in a
          tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking.

          over the edge.
<b>          
</b>          With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the
          punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the
          Mountie backs off just a bit --

          two-story roof and DOWN into --
<b>          
</b>          -- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers
          and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned
          by Gordon.
<b>          
</b>          As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers
          to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise

                     was willing to take on the Police
                     Department. Too risky, they said.
                     So finally I went to the very best
                     attorney in town, a man who's sued

          start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being
          right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the

                     up.
<b>

                     happened?

</b>                     I was afraid! I thought they'd
                     come after me, or my folks...so I
                     didn't tell anybody. I was on my
                     own until I got a free meal from
                     this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told
                     her I was an orphan, on my own.
                     She said I could stay on, and...I
                     did.
                          (beat)
                     Every night, I'd wake up, thinking
                     they were right outside my window.
                     Then I heard the police talking on
                     the radio about what happened at
                     the ranch, and I thought, for sure
                     I can't go back now.

</b><b>                               DAVID
</b>                     Since I didn't tell anybody what
                     happened, I was afraid they'd blame
                     me for those kids being dead. So I
                     just...stayed away.

                     after all this time?

</b>          And it's all Mrs. Clay can take. Sobbing, she runs out of
          the viewing room and into the interview room, where she goes
          to her son and embraces him, holds him, the two crying into
          one another's arms.

                     it that night, Detective. If one
                     got out, maybe either or both of
                     the others did too. Maybe Walter
                     went through the same fears he did.
                     Afraid to come home or identify
                     himself, afraid he'd get into
                     trouble, that people might think it
                     was his fault. Either way, it gives
                     me something I didn't have before
                     tonight.

</b>          Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935
<b>          
</b>          In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford
          Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for
          Boys for five years. Upon being released in 1934, he returned
          home to Canada, and was never heard from again.
<b>          
</b>          Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J.
          Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by
          Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and
          fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never
          paid.

</b>          One year after the City Council recommended the removal of
          the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from
          office and was replaced by Roy E. Steckel.

</b><b>          
</b>          Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red
          Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices,
          but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police
          corruption.

          In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal
          justice system in California was revised to prevent women
          from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of
          disagreeing with a male police officer. Strict medical
          procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse.

</b>          In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer was voted
          out of office after three terms. He was later found to have
          been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate,
          which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern
          California.

</b>          For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb used
          his radio show to expose police misconduct and political
          corruption. He also published "The Layman's Handbook of
          Daniel."

</b>          The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became
          synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch. In order
          to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name
          to Mira Loma.
