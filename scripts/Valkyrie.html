<b>
</b>   I swear by God this sacred oath:

   That I shall render unconditional obedience to
   Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the German Reich, and
   that I shall at all times be prepared, as a brave
   soldier, to give my life for this oath.

    And from out of the blackness a voice. A man speaking
    in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio.
    Subtitles translate the voice of Adolf Hitler.

<b>                       HITLER (V.O.)
</b>            My comrades. Once again - I don't
            know how many times it has been now
            - an attempt has been made on my
            life. I speak to you tonight for
            two reasons. First, so that you can
            hear my voice and know that I am
            unhurt. And second, so that you may
            know the details of a crime without
            parallel in German history...


<b>2   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                     2
</b>

</b><b>    13 MARCH 1943.
</b>
    A lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand
    rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform
    denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight.

<b>    TITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF
</b><b>    STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER.
</b>
    Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only
    movement in the frame.

    PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by
    Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS
    escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party
    dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie.
    Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of
    distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp.

    Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200
    Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109
    fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar
    that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the
    massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters
    roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors
    come to rest and, needing no introduction:

    ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by
    the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS.

    (Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire
    sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.)

</b>


    Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler,
    but they are pushed back by SS guards. The Führer
    marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or
    their waiting limo.

    To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto
    the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the
    windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive.
    Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.

<b>                       VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           It's not so much your car he
           doesn't trust... It's your driver.

    Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is:

<b>    TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER
</b><b>    OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION.
</b>
    The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in           
    a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops               
    into the limo they brought for Hitler.                          

    Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A
    beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car.


<b>3   EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY                              3
</b>
    Est. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is
    bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge.


<b>4   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - MESS HALL - DAY                  4
</b>
    Long tables packed with SOLDIERS straining their
    necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head
    table, but he is obscured by his detail of SS guards.
    ONE MAN dares to approach. The room falls silent.

    HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the
    Führer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite.
    We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he
    places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly,
    deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die.
    When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of
    the room relaxes slightly and digs in.

    ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow
    and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt,
    eating like a pig, still making notes in his book.              
    Tresckow stares.                                                
<b>
</b><b>                                                        3.
</b>


<b>                         TRESCKOW
</b>           Managing the Führer's security must
           be quite an undertaking.

<b>                         BRANDT
</b>                   (in between mouthfuls)
           Irregularity is the Führer's                            
           precaution of choice.

<b>                         TRESCKOW
</b>           I can assure you he's safe here.
           Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal.

    Brandt's look says, "Don't be ridiculous." He cleans
    his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth,
    takes out his datebook and starts writing - once
    again the precise man we saw on the airfield.

<b>                    TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
</b>           I understand you're returning to
           Berlin this afternoon...

    Brandt nods.

<b>                    TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
</b>           Could I trouble you to deliver a
           package to Colonel Stieff?

    Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the
    knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide...


<b>5   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER          5
</b>
    Tense silence. Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over
    two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to:

    TWO PAIRS OF BRITISH `CLAMS' - a small black plastic           
    casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape.             

    Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through
    the narrow opening. All that remains exposed is a
    small glass capsule. The trigger. Tresckow turns his
    attention to the bottles of Cointreau...


<b>6   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                      6
</b>
    The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off.
    Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards. Brandt
    is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         4.
</b>


    Tresckow and his Aide approach. Tresckow gently
    handles a carefully wrapped package.

    CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of
    the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The
    explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt.

<b>                         TRESCKOW
</b>           With my regards to Colonel Stieff.

    Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book. He
    studies the familiar shape.

<b>                          BRANDT
</b>           Cointreau? You better hope I don't
           get thirsty on the flight.

    Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having
    just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security.
    Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with
    Hitler. The door to the Condor is sealed behind him
    along with, we hope, the Führer's fate.

    Tresckow looks at his watch and we DISSOLVE TO:                   


<b>7   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             7
</b>
    A clock shows us that thirty minutes have passed.

    Tresckow and his Aide are seated on either side of a
    desk staring at the telephone. Smoking. Waiting...

<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>8   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             8
</b>
    Three hours later. The ashtray is overflowing but
    Tresckow and his Aide have not moved. Finally...

    The phone barely rings before Tresckow answers. He
    doesn't say a word, he only nods and hangs up.

<b>                        TRESCKOW
</b>           He's... landed.                                            

    It takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in.

<b>                           AIDE
</b>           What about the...

    Tresckow is already dialing the telephone.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          5.
</b>


<b>                          TRESCKOW
</b>            Get me Colonel Brandt...
                        (staying cool)
            Colonel? Tresckow... I trust you
            landed safely... I hate to trouble
            you but there's been a bit of a mix
            up. It seems you have the wrong
            bottles for Colonel Stieff. You...
            do still have the package?

     Long pause. Torture. Then:

<b>                     TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
</b>            I can be at your office first thing
            tomorrow morning to pick it up.
            Terribly sorry for the
            inconvenience... Thank you.

     Tresckow slowly hangs up the phone.

<b>                            AIDE
</b>            Do you think he knows?

     Tresckow shrugs, opening a bottle of Cointreau and
     pouring two glasses with a shaking hand.

<b>                          TRESCKOW
</b>            There's only one way to be sure...


<b>9    EXT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - DAY                               9
</b>
     Est. An early morning fog blankets the ground,
     obscuring our view. Eerie.


<b>10   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY                     10
</b>
     Footsteps echo through the cavernous hallways.
     Tresckow marches with purpose through the numerous
     security checkpoints. It is a long, suspenseful walk.
     He is aware of someone walking up behind him, getting
     closer. We think he's done for, but a BESPECTACLED,
     MIDDLE-AGED OFFICER overtakes him and whispers:

<b>                             OFFICER                                  
</b>            What happened?

</b>       I can only guess the altitude                        
       caused the fuse to malfunction.                      
       First the beer hall, Memorial Day -                  
       now this. Someone is watching over                   
       that sonofabitch, I swear it.                        

<b>                     OLBRICHT                               
</b>       We've been discovered.                               

Tresckow halts and faces Olbricht, expressionless.          

<b>                     TRESCKOW                               
</b>       What makes you think-

<b>                    OLBRICHT
</b>       Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo
       came for him last night.

Tresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking.
Olbricht hurries after him.

<b>                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
</b>       Did you hear what I said?

<b>                     TRESCKOW
</b>       The Gestapo could have arrested him
       for anything. Find a replacement.                    

<b>                    OLBRICHT
</b>       There's no one we can trust. Not in                  
       Berlin.                                              

<b>                     TRESCKOW
</b>       Then stop looking in Berlin.                         

Just then, they approach the final threshold, a             
SENTRY guards an office marked:

<b>COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT.
</b>
Olbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. But          
Tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to
enter when:

<b>                      SENTRY
</b>       Your pistol please.

Oh shit. Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol
from its holster and handing it over.                       

And with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his
shoulders and enters Brandt's office.

<b>11   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - BRANDT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    11
</b>
     Brandt is at his desk, writing as always. Tresckow
     notices Brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach. A
     clock ticks loudly. Imagine it. Then wait. Finally:            

     Brandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the          
     gesture is almost casual. Pure formality.                      

<b>                           BRANDT

            is having the strength to do it.                        

     Clunk. Brandt produces the package, putting it on the          
     desk in front of him.

     Pause. Staying cool, Tresckow reaches for it:                  

<b>                      BRANDT (CONT'D)

     Tresckow freezes, studies Brandt's cold smile.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          8.

<b>                          TRESCKOW

     Brandt sits back, smiles. Does he know?                          

<b>                           BRANDT
</b>            You've come a long way. You must be

<b>                          TRESCKOW
</b>            I wonder how the Führer, who does
            not partake, would feel about an
            officer who did so on duty...
            Colonel Brandt.

     Brandt's smile fades. We can't decide why. He picks
     up the package carelessly. Tresckow stays cool
     despite the armed explosive just a few feet away.

<b>                           BRANDT

     And we realize he really did just want a drink. He
     knows nothing about what the package hides.

<b>                          TRESCKOW
</b>            And I you.

     Tresckow reaches out, grabbing the package and:                  

     BANG. The sound of an EXPLOSION O.S. takes us to:

     Moving rapidly through an olive grove in the
     otherwise wasted desert. A column of tanks, trucks
     and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely
     contained chaos. Men dismantle tents from around
     others dumping documents into burning oil drums.

     In the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young
     officer (age 35). He wears an Afrika Korps uniform
     complete with Colonel's badges, staying cooler than
     the other side of your pillow. He directs men this
     way and that, holding back panic.

</b>


A jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by
a YOUNG LIEUTENANT.

<b>                 YOUNG LIEUTENANT
</b>       Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new
       headquarters has been established
       at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there.

Stauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless.

<b>                  STAUFFENBERG
</b>       Now they tell us to disengage - a
       day late. No matter how many times
       we tell Command the reality, they
       always manage to leave us-

But he stops himself, containing his rage.

<b>                 YOUNG LIEUTENANT
</b>       Colonel, the enemy is less than
       five kilometers from here. You've
       done all you can.

Stauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating
a ring on his finger. After a beat:

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I wonder... Was there even a point
       in our coming to Tunis?

<b>                YOUNG LIEUTENANT
</b>       To get taken prisoner, it seems.

Stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as:

BOOM. The first bomb explodes before we even see the
tight formation of BRITISH FIRE-BOMBERS overhead.
Fighter planes strafe with machine-guns. Artillery
blasts strike in front and behind the retreating
column. The 10th Panzer Division is trapped.

Panic hits the column like a tidal wave. Stauffenberg
taps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee.

Soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short
supply and many are left in the open. So they run.
Dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. The
survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn
to make another run. In a panic, the soldiers run the
other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way.

Stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat.

</b><b>            STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT.
</b>
     The men calm when they see the Colonel, trusting him.
     They turn and watch the formation of planes complete
     their turn and bear down, gaining speed. Knees tense,
     some jerking from the natural inclination to flee.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b><b>            STAND FAST, I SAID.
</b>
     They do, despite the menace of the planes' engines
     growing louder, meaner...


<b>13   INT. LEAD FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY                          13
</b>
     The confused PILOT takes in the mass of motionless
     men below. His finger tenses on the trigger and...


<b>14   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                        14

<b>                           STAUFFENBERG
</b><b>            NOW.
</b>
     The mob of soldiers breaks - some right, some left -
     as the fighters open fire on what had been the center
     of their mass. Unable to change course quickly
     enough, they spray their lead into the sand.

     In that same instant, Stauffenberg drops into his
     seat, the Young Lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and
     a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet.
     Stauffenberg watches his men regroup, waiting out the
     turning squadron. They've got the idea now. He turns
     to his Lieutenant who smiles admiringly. But
     Stauffenberg's eyes widen. He grabs his Lieutenant's
     head and jams it down, revealing a STRAY FIGHTER
     coming up from behind. Stauffenberg ducks out of
     frame, shielding the Young Lieutenant with his body.

     BANG. Blood sprays across the jeep's windshield
     before bullets rip it to pieces, leaving only clear
     blue African sky... And then the EXPLOSION.

     A fast clicking. Heels on linoleum. A beautiful,
     dignified woman keeps herself from running. She is:

     NINA VON STAUFFENBERG (30), Stauffenberg's wife and
     mother of his four children. Beside her is BERTHOLD
     VON STAUFFENBERG (38), Stauffenberg's older brother.

     They reach the door of a private hospital room just
     as A DOCTOR comes out. Awkward pause.

<b>                           DOCTOR
</b>            Mrs. Stauffenberg?

<b>                            NINA
</b>               (nodding, gesturing to Berthold)
            The Colonel's brother, Berthold.

<b>                           DOCTOR
</b>            Perhaps before you see the Colonel
            we should go to my office and-

<b>                            NINA
</b>            I will see my husband now.

     The Doctor wants to argue but Nina's eyes shut him
     down. He opens the door and they enter to find:


<b>16   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                         16
</b>
     A mass of mummy-like bandages with only small
     openings around the mouth and one eye. The arms and
     hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing. No movement
     but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest.

     Berthold cannot look. Holding back her anguish, Nina
     bravely turns to the Doctor. "Well?"

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>            He's been constant with fever but
            he refuses any pain killers. The
            right hand has been amputated above
            the wrist. He's lost the fourth and
            fifth fingers on the left. We...
            couldn't save the left eye.

     Berthold covers his face. Nina is a rock.

<b>                             NINA
</b>            His ring.

<b>                            DOCTOR
</b>            I don't-
<b>
</b><b>                                                        12.
</b>


<b>                            NINA
</b>            He had a ring on his right hand.
            Where is it?

<b>                           DOCTOR
</b>            I'm sorry... His hand was amputated
            in the field... I'm afraid-

<b>                             NINA
</b>            Thank you.                                               

     As in: "That will be all." The Doctor leaves. Nina              
     sits beside her husband. She shows him a photo of
     FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN - three boys and a girl.

     Stauffenberg tries to speak but can't. His eye begins
     to tear.

     Nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a
     chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. It
     is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa.

     CLOSE ON: The engraving inside the band - finis-
     initium [end-beginning]. Nina places the ring and
     chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. She
     cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands and
     turns away, not wanting her husband to see.

     Berthold takes her place. Stauffenberg struggles to
     speak. Berthold puts an ear to the hole where
     Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question,
     even if we can't. Berthold debates answering, then:

<b>                          BERTHOLD
</b>            We've lost North Africa.

     CLOSE ON: That one eye staring at us closes.


<b>17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER                          17
</b>
     Stauffenberg's bandages are gone - a black patch
     covering what had been his left eye. The chain with
     the cross and ring from Nina hangs around his neck.

     ANOTHER PATIENT lies motionless in the next bed.

     A man's belongings tell you more about him than he
     ever could. Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly
     arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well
     worn. Beside them are his own writings - the print
     meticulous and flowing. Up to a certain date. After
     that a new, child-like hand has taken over.
<b>
</b><b>                                                   13.
</b>


A family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of
another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a
bygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and
smiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa.

Stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under
his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to
button his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he
tries to do the buttons with the use of only three
fingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to
watch.

He is about to give up when he notices a figure
looming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces
at the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities.

<b>                  STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I don't know what I ever did with
       ten.

Olbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but
Stauffenberg beats him to it.

<b>              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>       I'm wanted in Berlin.

Olbricht nods.

<b>              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>       Are you asking as a member of the
       High Command?

Olbricht contemplates his answer. He carefully closes
the door behind him, nervously glancing at the
patient in the next bed.

<b>              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>       You can speak openly, General. He
       died just before you came in.

Awkward moment. Finally:

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       We could use your help.

<b>                  STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I'm a field officer.

Olbricht steps closer, speaking openly now.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       This war can't be won in the field.
<b>
</b><b>                                                 14.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       That's unfortunate for me.                         

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       You can't honestly believe you'll
       make a difference on the front-

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I'm a soldier, General. I serve my
       country.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       It makes no sense. You opposed
       Hitler, you opposed the war.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       The people chose otherwise and here
       we are. Now we have to win. You
       know what will happen if we don't.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       If we win, it will still be
       Hitler's Germany.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       We all took an oath, General.                      

Olbricht nods, resigning. He realizes it is no use.
Finally, he produces a blue velvet box, opening it to
reveal a brilliant gold medal.

<b>                    OLBRICHT
</b>       On behalf of the Führer.

Stauffenberg takes the medal and studies it.

<b>                  STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I'm a twin, you know.

Olbricht is as confused as we are.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       I... I didn't.

<b>                  STAUFFENBERG
</b>       My brother died the day after we
       were born.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       I'm sorry.

What the hell is he talking about?
<b>
</b><b>                                                         15.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            I was lying in the desert, covered
            in blood, sure I was going to die.
            I tried to think about my wife, my
            children... But my mind kept
            drifting to my dead brother. How I
            would finally be with him. How I
            would finally be whole again...

     He snaps out of his thoughts, holding up his arm.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>            This is my reward for what happened
            to my men. It's all I deserve.

     Stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a
     nearby bedpan.


<b>18   INT. HOSPITAL - CRITICAL WARD - DAY                       18

     CLOSE ON: A field of white. A three fingered hand             
     enters the frame, gently placing a medal identical to         
     the one just saw.                                             

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg, done up in his             
     finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an                
     unconscious WOUNDED SOLDIER.                                  

     AN AIDE stands behind him, carrying a silver tray             
     stacked with MANY BOXES containing such medals.               

     PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg stands              
     between two long rows of beds, each with A WOUNDED            
     SOLDIER. Those that can respond to Stauffenberg do so         
     with reverence. The ward is eerily silent.                    

     With only three fingers, Stauffenberg cannot pin the          
     medals to his men. He has to settle for simply laying         
     them on a each soldier's chest or a pillow. With each         
     medal he presents, the task becomes harder to watch.          

     Suddenly, Stauffenberg freezes, finding himself               
     looking at THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT - his driver in               
     Africa. The young man is a mass of bandages, his legs         
     gone, his face smashed.                                       

     CLOSE ON: Stauffenberg's face - the reality of Africa         
     taking the wind out of him. Over this we hear a               
     familiar clicking of heels and:

     Stauffenberg's boots pound the floor as he rushes for          
     the door, desperate to get out, barely able to                 
     breathe. At first he does not hear:

<b>                        VOICE (O.S.)
</b>            Colonel... COLONEL.

     A hand grabs his shoulder. Stauffenberg turns, ready
     to strike. He stops when he sees the Doctor holding a
     small, square box. Another sort medal perhaps?                 

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            I don't want the damn th-                               

     The Doctor opens the box to reveal:                            

     A GLASS EYEBALL sitting atop a layer of satin,
     staring blankly back at Stauffenberg. Creepy.

</b>            When will you be going back to the
            front?

     Beat. Stauffenberg just stares back at the eyeball.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            I'm not going to the front. I'm

     The city sleeps. An unsettling image knowing that, in

     Soft knocking at the front door is further muffled by
     heavy black-out curtains. A YOUNG OFFICER enters the
     frame, dousing the lights, parting the curtains and
     opening the door to reveal a SHADOWY FIGURE on the
     stoop.                                                         

     The figure steps into the half light to reveal his
     fresh scars and eye-patch. And from the dark quiet of          
     the foyer we CUT TO:

     Chaos. The air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh
     words. A DOZEN MEN - some officers, some civilians -
     are fighting bitterly, everyone talking at once.
     Stauffenberg enters unnoticed, escorted in by the
     YOUNG OFFICER who immediately ducks out again.

     Stauffenberg scans the faces in the room. We
     recognize Olbricht and Tresckow. With them we find...

     A distinguished gentleman in his early sixties:

<b>     TITLES: ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN - FORMER FIELD MARSHAL OF

<b>     TITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - FORMER MAYOR OF LEIPZIG.
</b><b>     RESIGNED IN PROTEST, 1937.
</b>
     And finally, a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly
     kind eyes, sitting outside the fight - tired and
     saddened by it.

And the shouting resumes. It is Beck who finally sees
Stauffenberg. He touches Tresckow's arm. He, in turn,
nudges Olbricht and so on. A moment later, the room
is silent, all eyes on the Colonel. Everyone is a
little embarrassed. Olbricht clears his throat:

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       Gentlemen, may I present Colonel
       Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned
       to my office at the War Ministry.

       Colonel, may I introduce-

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       These men need no introduction.

Beck stands, shaking Stauffenberg's hand.                  

<b>                       BECK
</b>       I apologize for this unfortunate...
       spectacle. On behalf of everyone,

But before he can finish, Beck is seized with a
gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill
through the room. He is very ill.                          

<b>                     GOERDELER

<b>                    GOERDELER
</b>                 (re: Stauffenberg)
       He's a field officer. He knows the
       army better than any of us. I want
       to hear his opinion.

       All right. What do you think,                     
       Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him               
       to resign? Or the central solution?               

But before Stauffenberg can answer:                      

<b>                    GOERDELER

       follow you at all?                                

The room quiets down. Beck hides a slight smile. He      
likes Stauffenberg already.

       control of the government when                    
       Hitler is gone?                                   

Silence. Then a wave of laughter. "The balls on this

            great many of them may hate Hitler,

            Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the                      
            Reich. That kind of fear won't just                      
            die with Hitler. And as for                              
            respect: the army, and the people,                       
            respect only one thing. Authority.                       
            And if just one man questions that

            force them - into following you?                         

     Pause. The conspirators look at one another again,
     unsure of how to answer. For Stauffenberg it is a
     dreadful revelation.


<b>23   EXT. BERLIN - STREET - NIGHT                             23
</b>
     A depressed Stauffenberg walks down the deserted
     night streets. Silent but for the echo of his
     footsteps. Eerie.

     Across the street, an OLD WOMAN peers nervously out
     her window. The instant Stauffenberg makes eye
     contact she steps back, drawing the curtains. Afraid.

     He approaches a cozy brick cottage - the Berlin home
     he shares with his brother, Berthold. He is surprised
     when he looks through the window to find FOUR
     CHILDREN laughing and playing - the sound of music on
     a phonograph. Bittersweet.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         21.
</b>


     In the next house over, he catches sight of a TEENAGE
     BOY, the picture of Aryan youth, watching him
     suspiciously from the upstairs window. It seems
     everyone is watching everyone in Hitler's German.


<b>24   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - NIGHT                            24
</b>
     Stauffenberg comes through the front door, the sound
     of the phonograph blaring now. Meet the children:
<b>     BERTHOLD (9), HEIMERAN (7), FRANZ (5), VALERIE (2).
</b>
     They chase one another around the house in their
     pajamas making such a racket that the phonograph
     skips. (It will do so throughout the scene.) The
     children see Stauffenberg and charge, screaming:

<b>                           CHILDREN
</b><b>            PAPA.
</b>
     He scoops them up, one by one, and kisses them,
     instantly putting the day's events behind him.
     Berthold follows them into the room, smiling.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>                         (to children)
            What are you doing here? I thought
            I left you in Bamberg.
                         (to Berthold)
            It's a wonderful surprise. Thank
            you, brother.

</b>
     Nina nervously fixes her hair in the mirror. LOOK
     DOWN TO REVEAL a small datebook with a smaller
     monthly calendar in the corner of the page. A red dot
     marks one date in particular, followed by black dots
     for each day that has passed since. She turns
     sideways, smoothing her dress over her belly. In
     every way she indicates to us that she is pregnant.

     She tucks the datebook under some sundries in her
     luggage and rushes down to greet her husband.

     We stay in the room, hearing her greet Stauffenberg
     O.S. Laughter at children's antics we cannot see. The
     phonograph skips. More laughter.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        22.
</b>

     We want to go see them in their happiness. Instead we
     linger on Stauffenberg's dresser - neat and orderly.
     We focus on a photograph of the family from happier
     times.

     Beside it is a small box containing a glass eye.                


<b>26   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT             26
</b>
     Stauffenberg and Nina dance with one another to the
     delight of the children. We gradually PUSH IN tight
     on their faces, watching an entire conversation take
     place without dialogue. Each has a secret the other
     can guess. Stauffenberg looks at Nina, then her
     belly, first realizing and then questioning. Nina
     smiles and nods. Stauffenberg hugs her, delighted,
     but his delight is tainted with worry.

     Then the tables turn. Nina looks at Stauffenberg, as
     if divining his secret. His face never changes - a
     statue with that same tainted smile. In her face we
     see slow, grim realization. She may not know exactly
     what is going on, but she knows it is something. She
     does her best to keep smiling for the children. After
     the longest of moments, she nods. "All right." Then
     she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears.

     It is an important moment. Read it again, taking the
     time to picture it in your mind. Then leave it alone.
     Done right it's a beautiful scene about a man, his
     family and the fate of the world.


<b>27   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT             27
</b>
     Nina reads a story to the children in the adjoining
     room - an idyllic scene. The sound of the phonograph
     is soft and constant.

     Stauffenberg picks at a late dinner, now adept at the
     use of only three fingers. Berthold sits across from
     him, deeply troubled by whatever conversation we have
     just missed. They speak in hushed tones.

<b>                          BERTHOLD
</b>            What do you mean you quit?

<b>                       STAUFFENBERG
</b>            I came to join the Resistance, not
            some sewing circle of discarded
            generals and politicians.
<b>
</b><b>                                                 23.
</b>


<b>                     BERTHOLD
</b>       Beck is a just and capable man. As
       for Goerdeler, well, he's popular.
       He'll make a good Chancellor.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately
       I have to wonder if Germany is even
       fit to choose her own destiny.

<b>                    BERTHOLD
</b>       You can't blame the people for
       this. You have to see the beginning
       of something to know how it'll end.
       It's no different than a farmer
       watching the corn grow. One day
       it's over his head.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       Plenty of people thought-

<b>                     BERTHOLD
</b>       The greatest offenders are not the
       ones who thought better but the
       ones who sensed better.

<b>                  STAUFFENBERG
</b>       What are you trying to say?

<b>                    BERTHOLD
</b>       I seem to remember you telling me
       about reports from the Ukraine -
       the SS forcing Jews to dig their
       own graves. You said then that
       Hitler should be removed. An
       officer's duty, you said. What's
       changed?

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I said senior officers. The only
       men that can get to him.                           

<b>                    BERTHOLD
</b>       Perhaps it doesn't matter that you
       succeed.

Stauffenberg looks at Berthold like he is crazy, but:

<b>                BERTHOLD (CONT'D)
</b>       Perhaps it only matters that you
       try. Don't you see? Someone has to
       stand up and show the world that
       not all of us were like him.

</b><b>                                                       24.

<b>                       STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Even if they could remove Hitler,
            they can't hope to seize power. For
            God's sake, they have no plan.

<b>                          BERTHOLD
</b>            Then give them one. Find a way.

     He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's arm.

<b>                     BERTHOLD (CONT'D)
</b>            Evil happens when good men do
            nothing.

     Before Stauffenberg can answer, new music comes
     blasting from the phonograph O.S. The unmistakable
     sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.

<b>                       STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Children, that is far too-

     He is cut off by the appearance of his four children,
     all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for
     helmets and brandishing makeshift swords. They charge
     into the room, singing loudly and attacking their
     father. He does his best to defend himself with one
     hand. Their commotion causes the phonograph to skip.

     And you'd think that's where it ends. We even pull
     back, creating that effect. It takes a moment to
     notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is
     not on the phonograph. Nina hears it first, then
     Stauffenberg and Berthold. Finally the children
     freeze and the phonograph skips without their help.
     The glasses on the table rattle.

     Now we hear the wailing quite clearly. A siren.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>            Air-raid.

     The adults herd the children out of the room. Muffled
     concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently,
     turning Wagner's masterpiece into a stutter.


<b>28   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BASEMENT - NIGHT               28
</b>
     The family rushes down the stairs, huddling in a
     corner - adults holding shivering children. The bombs
     are closer, louder. The Wagner, the siren, the
     explosions fray the nerves.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       25.

     Stauffenberg reaches for Nina in the darkness,
     finding her belly. Her hand clamps around his -
     around their unborn child.

     BOOM. So close the children scream. Dust and debris
     fall from the ceiling. The needle rakes the
     phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning.

     CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG - on his eye. His thoughts as
     the bombs fall all around his home - a moment of
     profound realization...


<b>29   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            29

     Move across the room to the phonograph, looking down
     at the 78 spinning on the turntable. The camera
     begins to turn until all the world around us is
     spinning and only the record is still. We read one
     word of the title of the 78 quite clearly:

     Tresckow explains even as he studies Stauffenberg,
     curious. What does he have in mind?

<b>                     TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
</b>            The Reserve Army has thousands of                       
            men all over the city - most of                         
            them not even in uniform. Valkyrie

       or killed.

<b>                    GOERDELER

</b>            Perhaps if we offered him a key

     dedicated soldier - sits at his desk, trying to
     ignore the screaming from the other room in between
     stolen glances at...

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg and Olbricht
     waiting patiently, sitting across from:

     MAJOR JOHN VON FREYEND, a dutiful Nazi whose face we
     immediately don't like. He smiles coldly, taking
     pleasure in the shouting O.S. He stares at
     Stauffenberg, studying him, making us nervous.

     Fromm's door finally opens and A BIGGER THAN LIFE
     NAZI storms out.

</b>            You're a woman, Fromm. And a fat

            the front if I didn't think you'd
            surrender just to be Montgomery's
            whore.

     Keitel storms out, leaving a pall. Freyend gives
     Stauffenberg a last once-over and follows. Beat:

     Stauffenberg and Olbricht step inside to find:

<b>     TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - COMMANDER OF THE
</b><b>     GERMAN RESERVE ARMY.
</b>
     The haggard Fromm sits at his desk, rubbing his
     temples. Stauffenberg and Olbricht share a confident
     look. Surely this guy hates the High Command. Without
     looking up to see them:

<b>                           FROMM

     Olbricht hesitates. Fromm looks up.

</b>            Well, Olbricht? Speak up.

<b>                          OLBRICHT

</b>            Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I'd
            offer my hand but you might not
            give it back.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG

Freeze. But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and         
laughs, taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and
nudging it toward them.

<b>                       FROMM
</b>       About time they put a man with
       balls in this office. Have a seat.
                    (to Olbricht)
       You too, if you must.

They sit. Fromm lights a cigarette, leans back and
exhales a cloud of smoke. We let things sit for
awhile. The game of recruitment is about to begin and
no one is sure where to start. The longer the quiet,
the more awkward things seem. Finally:

<b>                  FROMM (CONT'D)
</b>       They tell me you're critical of the
       war, Colonel. Not that you don't
       seem to have good reason.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I am critical of losing the war,
       General. All wars - as in Africa -
       are lost through indecision.

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       In the field, you mean.

He's baiting Stauffenberg to talk shit about Hitler.

<b>                    STAUFFENBERG
</b>       In Berlin.

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       I take it that's why you're here.
       To make decisions.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I've made my decision, General. I`m
       here to help others make theirs.

Stauffenberg makes no attempt to shade his delivery.
He is quite clearly indicating that he means more.
Fromm knows it, but he's being coy.

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       They say when there's no clear
       option, one should do nothing.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       We're at war. We must act.                         
       Sometimes... rashly.

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       Just what sort of rash action did
       you have in mind, Colonel?

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       That would be a decision for the
       Supreme Military Commander.

Fromm is getting the message. He takes a deep drag.

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       Supreme Commander, you say.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       Second only to the Chancellor.

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       If only I were that man... This war
       would be going quite differently.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       We were thinking the very same
       thing.

Fromm frowns at Olbricht. This was a bit too obvious.
Stauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look. "What the hell
are you doing?"

Fromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the
ashtray and picks up the telephone.

Olbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves -
certain they are going to be reported. But Fromm
doesn't dial. Instead, to our relief, he disconnects
the line. When he is certain that it is dead:

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       I don't need to remind you that
       we've all sworn an oath. That said,

       conversation with the understanding
       that such speak will never occur
       under this roof again. Am I clear?

<b>              STAUFFENBERG/OLBRICHT

<b>                        FROMM

     children, one by one, before placing them inside.                

     Then he turns to face Nina. As always, there is much             
     to be said that they cannot say. She gently touches
     the silver chain around his neck, the ring and the
     cross she gave him. They embrace tightly and kiss.
     She gets in the car, looking at him through the back

     are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance.

     From out of the darkness comes a candle held by a
     nervous, almost mousy young woman, FRAULEIN VON OVEN.
     Walking just behind her is Tresckow. He carries a
     small but heavy case in one hand.

     They come to a clearing in the woods and find a
     strange sight. In the center is a tree stump
     surrounded by papers, including the original orders
     for OPERATION VALKYRIE, next to a leather valise
     marked with the seal of the Reich. The orders have
     been meticulously annotated.

     Fraulein Oven gasps. Tresckow turns, pistol drawn.
     The tip of his barrel comes up just inches from
     Stauffenberg's eyepatch. Stauffenberg smiles,
     emerging from the shadows.

<b>                          TRESCKOW
</b>            Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me
            half to death.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG

     Wearing white gloves, Fraulein Oven opens the case
     Tresckow brought, revealing a portable typewriter.
     She carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into
     the machine and sets the margins carefully. Pause.
     Then she starts typing with remarkable speed.

     (Note: The sound of typing runs throughout the scene,
     punctuated by the crack of the carriage return - each
     time a little louder.)

     Stauffenberg and Tresckow carefully pore over the
     Valkyrie orders, scribbling copious notes.

<b>                          TRESCKOW
</b>            Looking this over, I'm not
            satisfied that the Reserve Army is

            Yes, I've been giving that some
            thought. We should include any
            field units that are home on leave.

     Before Tresckow can respond, more papers:

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>            I've also drawn up an outline for
            orders to streamline combat groups
            in order to quietly concentrate
            forces at vital points - state and
            government buildings, of course,
            but also the radio and newspapers.

     More papers. Tresckow can barely keep up.

               mobilized, eliminating the usual
               six hour lag. We blitz the

     around carefully. No one is in sight, but anyone              
     could be watching from the shadows. Eerie.

     each man's hand and walks away, swallowed up by the           
     darkness. When she is gone:

Obviously not. Then it occurs to Stauffenberg.

<b>                     TRESCKOW                             
</b>       It's more likely just... an                        
       unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it                 
       doesn't matter. You wrote the

       wit or the spine. No. It's you.                    

A million thoughts are running through Stauffenberg's     
mind. Fear. Anxiety. But he knows what he must do.        

<b>                TRESCKOW (CONT'D)                         
</b>       One more thing. You were right what                
       you said that first night. It's not                
       enough to kill Hitler. We need to                  
       isolate his chain of command. The                  
       slightest confusion could crush us.                
       We need to be certain that no                      
       conflicting orders get out after                   
       the flash.                                         

Stauffenberg considers this for a moment.

     Pause. A sad smile and nod from Tresckow, a moment             
     ago he was in charge. Now he has no clearance.

<b>39   INT. OFFICERS' CLUB - BERLIN - NIGHT                    39
</b>
     A wild party - a small band, German officers, plenty
     of women.

     In stark contrast, two GESTAPO MEN sip coffee at a
     corner table, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd.

     A WAITER carries a tray of drinks to a rowdy group in
     the corner who are immersed in the denial common to
     Berlin these days. The Waiter serves carefully,
     making sure one particular drink goes to:

<b>     TITLES: GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL - CHIEF OF THE ARMY
</b><b>     SIGNAL CORPS.
</b>
     The group toasts and downs their booze.

     CLOSE ON: Fellgiebel's smile suddenly fades. He looks
     into his glass, his good mood vanishing. He politely
     excuses himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and
     heads for the bathroom. He looks ill.

<b>40   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                     40

     Fellgiebel walks to the sink and dumps what is left
     of his drink in the basin.

     CLOSE ON: Mingling among the melting chunks of ice is
     a GLASS EYE staring back at him.

     He scowls in the mirror at Stauffenberg, waiting.

<b>                         FELLGIEBEL
</b>            You realize how close I am to
            Hitler. With one word I could have
            the Gestapo make you disappear.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Why haven't you then?

     Fellgiebel checks the stalls to make sure they are
     empty. Stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the
     sink, dabbing it dry on a hand towel.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>            None of my associates know we've
            been talking if that's what you're
            afraid of.

<b>                         FELLGIEBEL
</b>            But you know. And when the SS catch
            you, they'll pull you apart like
            warm bread. It'll be a crime just
            to have known you then. I warn you.
            If it means protecting myself, I
            will expose you. Do not try to
            contact me again.

     Fellgiebel heads for the door but stops on:

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            You can't report me. Maybe if you
            had when I first approached you,

            But now you're just as guilty as-

<b>                         FELLGIEBEL
</b>            So you think that makes me a
            sympathizer, eh? You give a man the
            choice of betraying a fellow
            officer or his Führer and assume
            his actions will show you his
            heart. It's not that simple.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       It is to me.

<b>                    FELLGIEBEL
</b>       For the last time, don't push me to
       make a decision.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I have no choice. It's clear now
       that without you we have no hope of
       success.

Pause. Fellgiebel's silence speaks volumes.

<b>              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>       You want us to succeed. Don't you?

<b>                    FELLGIEBEL
</b>       And what if you do, eh? What then?
       Will you be any different from
       Hitler? What of his Reich, his
       people, the very momentum of
       history? Will all of that let you
       be something he isn't?

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       No.

<b>                      FELLGIEBEL
</b>       There it is.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       But my pregnant wife, our four
       children, the Germany I first swore
       to defend... They demand that I be
       something different. They demand
       that I fight for their future even
       if it means...

And for a moment his voice breaks and he chokes back
what may be tears.

<b>              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>       Even if it means that I never see
       them again.

In that moment we see a side of Stauffenberg we were
starting to doubt existed. We see his humanity. This
puts Fellgiebel in his place. He adjusts his tie and
we see the wedding ring on his finger.

                     (stepping closer now)

     BANG. The door bursts open, startling them both. But
     it is only a DRUNKEN OFFICER and a YOUNG WOMAN
     looking for some privacy.

<b>                      DRUNKEN OFFICER

     What first catches our eye is the enormous portrait
     of Hitler looming over Stauffenberg's desk.

     Stauffenberg sits before a mountain of paperwork,
     surrounded on all sides by a flurry of SECRETARIES
     and AIDES. He looks up to find:                               

     Olbricht hovering in the doorway with that look that          
     says, "We need to talk." Stauffenberg clearly doesn't
     have the time. He sighs.

     The staff instantly exits - a well-oiled machine.
     Stauffenberg unplugs the phone.

Some men might find a promotion to be good news. Not
Stauffenberg.

       you. You will accept the
       appointment. Is that understood?

Stauffenberg nods, grudgingly.

<b>                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
</b>       Now. The new man is waiting
       outside. He comes highly
       recommended. He might even be an
       ideal candidate.

       We still need an assassin.

Olbricht leaves. Stauffenberg lets this sink in. He
takes a seat and goes back to work. After a moment:

A HANDSOME SOLDIER (36) quietly enters.                     

<b>TITLES: LIEUTENANT WERNER VON HAEFTEN - RESERVIST.
</b><b>WOUNDED DURING THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN.

Haeften clicks his heels and offers the Nazi salute,
but before he can say the words:

<b>                    STAUFFENBERG
</b>       Be seated.

Thrown, Haeften sits. Stauffenberg continues writing,
ignoring him. Haeften looks up at the portrait of
Hitler, startled when Stauffenberg finally speaks:

<b>              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>       Do you know how this war will end,
       Haeften? The portrait will be un-
       hung... And the man will be hung.

Stauffenberg looks up - looking for a reaction to
such frank and treasonous talk. He gets none. He
sighs, too tired to play games.

<b>              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>       Bottom line. I'm engaged in high

     And the strangest thing - a reaction no one would
     suspect - Haeften relaxes, almost sighs, like someone
     who has at long last found a home.

     NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF D-DAY. Allied forces invade
     Normandy. The liberation of Europe has begun.

     But this is not the D-Day you learned about in
     history class. This is a German newsreel. Nazi spin.
     In it, Hitler's forces have nothing to fear.

            The Allied Forces have blundered
            into the trap awaiting them on the
            beaches of Normandy - heroically
            repelled by the combined might of
            the German Army. It is a glorious
            day for the Reich. At long last the
            craven enemy has come to Europe to
            face their inevitable defeat at the

            Allied forces.

     Haeften and Stauffenberg ride in a sedan.                      
     Stauffenberg is in profile the entire time.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real
            aim is to leave nothing but
            scorched earth for all of Europe.

     Stauffenberg rubs his forehead. The car stops.                  
     SOLDIERS are waiting outside.

     Stauffenberg gets out of the car wearing an ornate
     dress uniform and carrying a leather valise. He has
     arrived at a meeting of great importance.

     He turns to face Haeften directly and we are
     surprised to see both of his eyes - for an instant
     the young lion he once was. But a closer look is
     unsettling - we see the faint scarring, one eye
     glowing and alive, the other cloudy and dead.

     His glass eye. Stauffenberg only wore it on special
     occasions. This is one.

</b>            Maybe this is a blessing in
            disguise. Maybe he'll finally
            listen to reason - consider a truce
            while he still can.

<b>     TITLES: THE BERGHOF. 7 JUNE 1944.
</b>
     Stauffenberg walks up a flight of wide marble stairs -
     at the top he sees a group of WAITING ADJUTANTS
     quietly smoking cigarettes - a clique of devoted
     Nazis. In the group is Major Freyend, the wormy
     officer we saw outside Fromm's office. He watches
     Stauffenberg pass, aloof. We hate him.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         44.
</b>


     Just then Stauffenberg is greeted by TWO SS OFFICERS
     who move to physically search him - one his body, the
     other his valise.

<b>                        VOICE (O.S.)
</b>            You don't need to search him.                             

     ANGLE ON: Fromm's adjutant, Lt. Herber approaches,
     waving off the SS.

<b>                          HERBER
</b>            Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored
            guest. The hero of Africa.

     The SS officers stand down. Herber and Stauffenberg              
     share a friendly smile, about to speak when Fromm
     walks up on them:

<b>                           FROMM
</b>            For God's sake, Stauffenberg,                             
            you're-                                                   

     He pauses, clearly caught off guard when he sees                 
     Stauffenberg with two eyes.

</b>
     Stauffenberg and Fromm enter to the last thing we
     would expect. Laughter. Drunken laughter.

<b>     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: THE BIG SIX.
</b>
     Hitler and five men - some of them almost
     caricatures, their features so distinct. The first
     man we recognize as Keitel - the general who reamed
     Fromm. The others we know from history and TITLES:

<b>     MINISTER ALBERT SPEER - ARCHITECT FOR THE NEW REICH.
</b>
<b>     DR. JOSEPH GOEBBELS - REICH MINISTER OF PUBLIC
</b><b>     ENLIGHTENMENT AND PROPAGANDA.
</b>
<b>     REICHSFÜHRER HEINRICH HIMMLER - HEAD OF THE SS AND
</b><b>     GESTAPO.
</b>
<b>     REICH MARSHAL HERMANN GOERING - HEAD OF THE GERMAN
</b><b>     ARMED FORCES, HITLER'S SECOND IN COMMAND.
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                    45.
</b>


We have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of Nazi
Germany on the day after the Normandy invasion. But
you would never know the tide of the war had just
turned against Germany. A series of situation maps
are scattered before them, ignored.

Only Speer seems to be reserved, smiling politely but
clearly tuned into the present reality. Looking
closer at Goering we see he is wearing heavy make-up -
adding to the already surreal nature of the scene.

It is also the first time we are allowed a clear,
unobstructed view of Hitler.

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       Mein Führer... I wish to present
       Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg -
       our new Chief of General Staff for
       the Replacement Army.

The laughter stops. Hitler and his cronies turn
toward Stauffenberg, looking him over. Hitler stands
and crosses to him. Fromm meets him first, whispering
in the Führer's ear - perhaps reminding him who
Stauffenberg is. Hitler nods: "Ah yes." He takes
Stauffenberg's left hand with both of his. We are
surprised by his charm.

<b>                     HITLER
</b>       May I say, I am honored to meet a
       hero who has sacrificed so much for
       Germany. If only more of my
       officers were like you.

Hitler's cronies smile despite the subtle insult to
themselves. To make it worse, Hitler turns to them.

<b>                 HITLER (CONT'D)
</b>       Let this man stand as an example to
       all of you. He is the ideal German
       officer.

Fromm nervously clears his throat.

<b>                      FROMM
</b>       Mein Führer, we have asked
       Stauffenberg here today so that he
       might brief us on mobilizing troops
       from the Home Army to support those
       in Normandy.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      46.
</b>


<b>                           HITLER
</b>            Hmmm? Oh yes, Normandy. That will
            no longer be necessary. General
            Goering has assured me that
            Normandy is under control.

     Stauffenberg's good eye flickers. "Are you insane?
     Normandy is a catastrophe." Another glance at the
     situation map shows Allied forces over-running.

     But the painted-on smiles of Hitler's nodding cronies
     promote the lie. No one has the courage to tell
     Hitler anything close to the truth. Somewhere in
     their eyes is the fear that someone will.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Mein Führer, if I may... The
            situation in Normandy is-

<b>                           KEITEL
</b>            You're dismissed, Stauffenberg.

<b>                         STAUFFENBERG
</b>            But-

<b>                           KEITEL
</b>            Send your man home, Fromm. Then
            bring us some brandy.

     Fromm is stung - a man of his rank being treated like
     a waiter. Stauffenberg steps back, clicks his heels
     and salutes, just managing to say:

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Heil Hitler.

     Hitler half waves, walking slowly back to his seat.
     Fromm and Stauffenberg leave.


<b>46   EXT. THE BERGHOF - NIGHT                                46
</b>
     Fromm escorts a visibly shaken Stauffenberg to his
     waiting vehicle. Haeften opens the car door for
     Stauffenberg to get in. Fromm leans in.

<b>                           FROMM
</b>            I don't know what you've got
            brewing and I don't want to know...
            But when the music stops, I'd be
            much obliged if Keitel should find
            himself without a chair.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      47.
</b>


     Is Fromm saying he's in? Is Keitel's death a
     condition? Hard to say and meant to be. Before
     Stauffenberg can inquire, Fromm slams the door shut
     and returns to the madness inside the Berghof.


<b>47   INT. MILITARY SEDAN - CONTINUOUS                        47

     Stauffenberg leans back in his seat, mentally
     calculating his next step.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            They're all insane. Every one of
            them except for Speer, and he's
            nothing but an architect.

     Stauffenberg puts on his eyepatch before removing his
     glass eye. He polishes it with a cloth and now it
     stares at him from his gloved hand. A conscience.

<b>                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>            Tell Beck we've found our
            assassin...
                 (off Haeften's confused look)
            I'll do it myself.


<b>48   INT. CHURCH - NIGHT                                     48
</b>
     We find ourselves in an empty church. Beck is seated
     in a pew staring straight ahead. Stauffenberg sits
     directly behind him. They can't risk being seen
     together. They speak in hushed tones.

     The first thing we notice is how weak and ill Beck
     looks. He struggles to hide a persistent cough.

<b>                            BECK
</b>            Out of the question. It won't work.
            We need you here in Berlin.

<b>                       STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Who else, then? Who can even get as
            close?

     Beck knows there is no other choice.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>            Valkyrie is very clear. Once the
            order is given, the Reserve Army                        
            will automatically seize control of
            the government with or without me.

</b>            Orders are not enough. They need a                        
            man to follow. The right man.                             

     Pause. Stauffenberg knows he's right. The fucking                
     pressure. He thinks for a moment, then with a sigh:              

<b>                       STAUFFENBERG                                   
</b>            Olbricht will oversee operations in                       
            my absence. I can be back in Berlin                       
            three hours after Hitler is-                              

     Stauffenberg shuts up, lowering his head in prayer as
     a CLERGYMAN passes. Once they are again alone:

<b>                            BECK                                      
</b>            Three very crucial hours.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            We both know there's no other way.

     Beck nods, resigned.

<b>                           BECK
</b>            I'll tell the others-

     As if on cue, Beck loses control of his cough.
     Stauffenberg leans forward, handing him a
     handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his
     shoulder until the old man's hacking subsides.

<b>                       BECK (CONT'D)
</b>            I'm afraid whatever the outcome, I
            won't be there to see it.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Nonsense. You're stronger than you
            think. You might just be the
            strongest one of all.

<b>50   EXT. STAUFFENBERG HOME - BACK LAWN - CONTINUOUS           50
</b>
     Once again, the scene idyllic. The Stauffenberg
     children play football in the distance. Stauffenberg
     himself is out of uniform for the first time since
     the hospital, but he does not seem relaxed.
<b>

Nina sits across from him, half-reading a book, half
talking to her husband. Stauffenberg cannot hear a
word she is saying - he is miles away.

He looks over at his children. One would never
suspect that Germany has waged a calamitous war and
that the country is facing total devastation.

<b>                       NINA
</b>       ...After that I thought I'd take
       the children to the country for a
       few days to see my- Claus?

He snaps out of his thoughts. "Hmmm?"

<b>                  NINA (CONT'D)
</b>       Have you heard a word I said?

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       The country...
                      (thinking)
       Nina. Listen. I want you to delay
       your trip. Just for a while.

She wants to ask, he wants to tell her. Finally:

<b>                       NINA
</b>       Does this have something to do
       with... your work?

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       I would just be more comfortable
       knowing where you are - until I'm
       back from Berlin. Things will be
       different then. I promise.

Long pause. Once again, a couple who know each other
well enough to not have to say things plainly. Nina
is worried but strong.

<b>                       NINA
</b>       How long until... until we see you?

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       A few days. If all goes well. Then
       we can travel as a family.

<b>                       NINA
</b>       And if things... don't go well?

He hesitates.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         50.

<b>                       STAUFFENBERG

<b>                          CHILDREN
</b>            PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US. (Etc.)

     The children kick the ball toward Stauffenberg - the
     one sport he can play. He is about to say something
     to Nina, but she cuts him off.

<b>                            NINA
</b>            Go be with your children.

     Stauffenberg stands, touching Nina's cheek and
     kissing her forehead. We stay on her as he joins the
     children. She watches them play together, seeing her
     husband laughing for the first time in a long while.
     Her eyes well with tears - a mixture of happiness and
     anguish. Too good to last, too much to bear.

     He empties the contents of two tawny leather
     briefcases onto the table:

     Along with a crude drawing covered with calculations
     he produces two brick-like lumps wrapped in butcher

<b>                      MERTZ
</b>       Theoretically there's a 30-minute
       delay. But with the kind of heat
       you can expect at the Wolf's Lair,
       I'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops.

     Before Haeften can answer, Fromm shoots them both a
     glare. "What the hell are you doing?"

<b>                           KEITEL
</b>            ...Gentleman. You are dismissed.

     And like that, the briefing has ended. Stauffenberg
     is sickened - the opportunity lost. Hitler exits,
     walking right past him. Keitel and the rest file out.
     The last to leave is Fromm.

<b>                           FROMM
</b>            That call better have been
            important.

     Stauffenberg turns, coming face-to-face with Freyend,
     Keitel's hateful toady. He holds the missing
     briefcase. For a moment we're sure the jig is up.

<b>                          FREYEND

     He hands it over and leaves.

     A military sedan skids to a stop outside the Guard
     Battalion headquarters. Olbricht jumps from the car,
     racing to get General Hase's attention.

     LARGE FORMATIONS of soldiers stand at attention in
     the hot sun, awaiting orders.

<b>                            HASE

            What the hell is going on? My men
            have been standing here for an
            hour. I don't know what to tell
            them.

     CLOSE ON REMER (the officer we told you to remember)
     standing before the ranks. He eyes Hase and Olbricht
     suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying.
     After a moment, Hase addresses the men.
<b>
</b><b>                                                 60.

</b>       At ease, gentlemen.

Olbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to
hide his nerves.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       This has been a drill. You're all
       to be commended for your quick
       response. Dismissed.

Pause. The men linger, confused until:

<b>                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
</b><b>       HEIL HITLER.
</b>
<b>                      SOLDIERS
</b><b>       HEIL HITLER.

And the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just
light up and shoot the shit. Hagen approaches Remer.

<b>                      HAGEN
</b>       What did I tell you? A drill.

But Remer is not so sure. The way he stares at
Olbricht makes us nervous.

CLOSE ON: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making
note of the esteemed KNIGHT'S CROSS pinned to Remer's     
uniform. Olbricht leans toward Hase.

<b>                    OLBRICHT

<b>                      HASE

     Stauffenberg stops, glaring at Fromm with his one

Stauffenberg says nothing. He's too cool. Goerdeler
looks at the other conspirators, but no one is going
to speak for him. Finally, almost in tears:

Ugly pause. Goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks
out. We could not be happier to see him go. Beck
coughs, turns to Stauffenberg.

     A tawny leather briefcase sits on a neatly made bed.

     Stauffenberg, freshly bathed and wrapped in a towel,
     shaves in front of the mirror. For the first time we
     see his scars and deformities in full. He looks
     himself over, finally focusing on the chain around
     his neck, contemplating the small cross and the ring -
     its engraving: finis-initium [end-beginning].

     Though his face is clean-shaven now, he continues,
     slowly running the razor down his throat. Then he
     stops, pressing the blade a little too hard and
     bringing blood. It almost seems intentional.

<b>79   INT. SMOKY ROOM - DAY                                     79
</b>
     A group of 30 RESISTANCE OFFICERS talk quietly,
     smoking cigarettes and waiting anxiously. Many of the
     faces we recognize, some we see for the first time.
     We notice Witzleben has donned his old military
     uniform, looking a little too proud.

     Beck looks over the faces of these men, trying to
     contain his own fear. His eye catches the door
     opening and a MAN IN A DECORATED POLICE UNIFORM
     entering the room. We tense.

     One by one, the men in the room stop talking, staring
     at the police officer. Just as we think it's over:

<b>                            BECK
</b>            Gentlemen, may I introduce Chief
            Helldorf. He's guaranteed the full
            support of the Berlin Police.

     Helldorf nods. The men breathe a collective sigh of
     relief. Some laugh. Many shake Helldorf's hand.

<b>                       BECK (CONT'D)
</b>            We can begin.

     Beck moves to a table covered with maps of Berlin,
     Paris and the Wolf's Lair.

<b>                       BECK (CONT'D)
</b>            Hitler has scheduled a military
            briefing for today at one o'clock.
            Stauffenberg will strike regardless
            of who else is present.

     As Beck speaks, we see how things should play out...


<b>80   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    80
</b>
     Stauffenberg and Haeften are driven in a topless
     sedan. Each carries his leather briefcase.

<b>                        BECK (V.O.)
</b>            Once in position, he will signal us
            once to alert the troops and again
            after the flash...


<b>81   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - BUNKER - DAY                           81
</b>
     Stauffenberg and Haeften quickly get in the sedan -
     the concrete bunker just behind him - its steel door
     closed. They speed out of frame a beat before a
     muffled explosion rocks the bunker - the steel door
     bulges but holds fast. Only a wisp of smoke escapes.


<b>82   INT. WAR MINISTRY- FROMM'S OFFICE - DAY                   82
</b>
     SOLDIERS burst into Fromm's office and arrest the
     bewildered General without incident.

<b>                        BECK (V.O.)
</b>            Assuming Fromm refuses to join us,
            Olbricht will take Command of the
            Reserve Army and initiate Operation
            Valkyrie.

     Olbricht takes Fromm's place and starts making calls.
     At least this is how it should happen...


<b>83   INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - DAY                          83

     Establishing shots of the idle troops and equipment
     as they are once again called into action.

<b>                        BECK (V.O.)
</b>            Then he'll notify all district
            commanders between Paris and Berlin
            that the SS is attempting to seize
            power. The Reserve Army will arrest
            all SS, Gestapo and Nazi officials.

     The same soldiers are now storming government
     buildings and seizing personnel.

     Witzleben and Beck march in with ARMED SOLDIERS.

<b>                        BECK (V.O.)
</b>            When the time is right, Witzleben
            and I will arrive at the War

            Commander of the Armed Forces and
            Head of State, respectively.


<b>85   INT. RADIO STATION - DAY                                  85

     Goerdeler stands at a radio microphone, reading
     passionately from a prepared script with dramatic
     gestures painfully reminiscent of Hitler.

<b>                        BECK (V.O.)
</b>            With Berlin secured, Goerdeler will
            return and address the nation as
            our new Chancellor. Then, God
            willing, we can negotiate a truce
            with the Allies and spare Europe
            from total destruction.

<b>                            BECK

            live sacred Germany.                                      

     The conspirators salute and leave. Beck places both
     hands on the table to support himself, coughing and
     exhausted. Then he looks nervously at his watch...


<b>87   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY               87

     Olbricht paces before his desk. Mertz watches him,               
     anxiously waiting for:

</b>
     The plane touches down and taxis to a stop.
     Stauffenberg and Haeften deplane and immediately step
     into a waiting courier car driven by a young, dutiful
     Nazi. SECOND LIEUTENANT KRETZ. Remember him.


<b>89   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - DAY                                    89
</b>
     Even this early, the heat is oppressive.

     We watch from a distance as the courier car is
     stopped at the outer checkpoint. Once again, the
     GUARD carefully examines Stauffenberg and Haeften's
     identification and takes their pistols before
     allowing the car to pass. We follow.

     courier car arrives.                                             

     Stauffenberg and Haeften are greeted by Freyend who              
     shows them to:                                                   


<b>91   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS          91
</b>
     TWO OFFICERS are already waiting. They stand...

<b>                          FREYEND
</b>            Gentlemen, may I present Colonel
            Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief
            Officer of the Reserve Army.

<b>                         OFFICER #1
</b>            Colonel Stauffenberg. This is an
            honor. They say you're the man that
            will defend Berlin from the Red
            Army single-hand-

     The officer realizes what a faux pas he has made as
     soon as he says it. Unfazed, Stauffenberg smiles,
     raising his briefcase with his single hand.
<b>
</b><b>                                                    71.
</b>


<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       Indeed. I've got the whole bag of
       tricks right here.

The officers laugh nervously, relieved he was not
insulted. Idiots. Meanwhile, Freyend steps toward
Haeften, reaching for the handle of his briefcase.

<b>                     FREYEND
</b>       Let me take that for you.

But Haeften snaps the case back. Freyend raises a
suspicious eye. Before he can press:                        

<b>                   VOICE (O.S.)                             
</b>       Colonel Stauffenberg?

Everyone turns to find General Fellgiebel standing at       
the door. Everyone stands at attention.                     

<b>                    FELLGIEBEL                              
</b>       At east, Gentlemen.                                  
                  (to Stauffenberg)                         
       General Fellgiebel, communications.                  
       I just wanted to meet the hero of                    
       Africa... And see if there's                         
       anything you need.                                   

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG
</b>       Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a                  
       call of the utmost importance. Even                  
       if it comes when I am in conference                  
       with the Führer I'd appreciate it                    
       if you had a man come and get me.                    

Beat. Fellgiebel and Stauffenberg share an instant
look of understanding.

<b>                    FELLGIEBEL
</b>       Of course, Colonel.

Fellgiebel salutes. Stauffenberg and the others             
return it as Fellgiebel departs. Just then, Keitel          
bursts from his office, fixing his tie.

<b>                      KEITEL
</b>       Gentlemen. The meeting has been
       pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini
       is arriving on the afternoon train
       and Hitler wants to have lunch with
       him.

Stauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         72.
</b>


<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Will Mussolini be in the briefing?

<b>                           KEITEL
</b>            I only wish he were. Then some
            ambitious officer might take the
            opportunity to shoot the dago
            bastard.

     Keitel makes a beeline for the door and the others
     follow like good sheep. Stauffenberg holds back,
     however, attracting Freyend's attention.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            I'll need a place to wash up -
            change my shirt.

     Stauffenberg points to the shaving cut on his throat
     and the tiny blood stain on his shirt. The cut was
     intentional after all.

     Annoyed, Freyend motions to the adjoining anteroom.

<b>                          FREYEND
</b>            Please, do be quick. You heard the
            General.

     Stauffenberg nods in appreciation. He motions for
     Haeften to follow him. Freyend watches, curious.


<b>92   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                92
</b>
     Fast on Stauffenberg's heels, Haeften closes the
     door. A large portrait of Hitler looms, watching.
     Stauffenberg positions himself at a small desk with
     his back to the door. He removes a brick of plastic
     explosive from his briefcase.

<b>                          HAEFTEN
</b>                         (whispering)
            You're arming them... now?                                

     Stauffenberg quickly unbuttons his shirt, taking a
     clean one out of his bag and putting it on as:

     Haeften assembles a fuse.

<b>                       STAUFFENBERG
</b>            No room for error this time. Assume
            I have ten minutes in this heat.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         73.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>            Two minutes for the walk, one for
            the security check and one to the
            bunker. Three minutes for the walk
            back. That's seven.

<b>                          HAEFTEN
</b>            Leaving just three minutes to place
            the bomb.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Plenty of time.

<b>                          HAEFTEN
</b>            If the bomb goes off in ten.

     He carefully inserts the fuse into the explosive.

     The RING OF A TELEPHONE startles us.


<b>93   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY                 93

     CLOSE ON THE TELEPHONE. Freyend answers.

            They are on their way now.

     Freyend hangs up, glancing impatiently at his watch.


<b>94   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                94

     Neatly dressed again, Stauffenberg carefully places
     the primed explosive back in his briefcase. He and
     Haeften turn their attention to the second explosive -
     assembling the fuse, about to insert it when:

     BANG. The door swings suddenly open - stopped short
     by Stauffenberg's backside. He nearly drops the fuse.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Dammit man, what is it?

     It's Freyend, of course, trying to peer through the
     partially opened door. Stauffenberg hides the bombs
     with his body.

<b>                          FREYEND
</b>            General Keitel insists that the

     Haeften scoops the unarmed explosive into his
     briefcase. Stauffenberg motions for Haeften to leave.


<b>95   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY                      95
</b>
     Haeften comes out, moving Freyend back with his body
     and shutting the door behind him - a charged moment.

<b>                          HAEFTEN
</b>            The Colonel is changing, Major. You
            understand this can be difficult.

     Freyend backs down. A little.


<b>96   INT. KEITEL'S OFFICE - CHANGING ROOM - DAY                96
</b>
     Stauffenberg produces a pair of pliers (one handle
     specially bent for easier use by a man with only
     three fingers). With some effort, he manages to
     secure the pliers around the fuse.

     CLOSE ON THE ACID CAPSULE OF THE FUSE. The jaws of
     the pliers gently squeeze, crushing it. The bomb is
     live. There is no turning back now.

     Stauffenberg closes his briefcase and opens the door,
     greeted by Freyend and Haeften.


<b>97   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE KEITEL'S OFFICE - DAY          97

     Freyend scurries, trying to catch up with Keitel.
     Stauffenberg and Haeften lag behind.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>                         (to Haeften)
            See that the car is ready.

     Haeften looks down at the briefcase in his hand - the
     second, unarmed explosive inside.

<b>                           HAEFTEN
</b>            But sir-

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            I have everything I need,
            Lieutenant. Thank you.

     Haeften reluctantly takes his leave just as Freyend
     turns back, eager for Stauffenberg to pick up the
     pace. He reaches for the briefcase.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         75.

<b>                          FREYEND

</b>                       (pulling it away)
            I can manage, thank you.

     Freyend seems more than just a little peeved. But
     Stauffenberg doesn't notice. He is focused straight
     ahead, mentally calculating what time he has left.

     The bunker suddenly seems miles away.


<b>98   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTSIDE BUNKER - DAY                   98

     Security Perimeter I. Keitel and his men file through
     the heavily guarded entrance. Each man holds up his
     pass for the GUARDS to inspect. Stauffenberg is last.

     Keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead -
     AWAY FROM THE BUNKER. Stauffenberg is confused.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>            Where are they going?

<b>                          FREYEND
</b>            It's too hot. The briefing has been
            moved to the conference hut.

     ANGLE ON: The conference hut. The door and many
     windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open.
     Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure
     vital to Stauffenberg's plan. But this obstacle only
     seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier
     after all. And no military operation goes according
     to plan. Making matters worse:

<b>                      FREYEND (CONT'D)
</b>            Sir, your briefcase. I insist.

     Annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion,
     Stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over. He
     watches Freyend carry the bomb into the hut. Pause.

     Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to:

     Fellgiebel - standing by the communications building.
     The man who will get Stauffenberg out of the room
     before the bomb goes off. They share a nod. Then
     Stauffenberg steps into the hut.

      In the room beyond we see Hitler at the end of a long
      table surrounded by RANKING OFFICERS. One by one,
      they present their individual briefings to the
      nodding Führer. Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend.

<b>                         STAUFFENBERG
</b>             My injuries left me a bit hard of
             hearing. See that you place me as
             near the Führer as possible.

      Freyend nods, but for now his concerns are elsewhere -
      wrangling everyone into the meeting.

      Like the other officers, Stauffenberg hangs up his
      belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing
      room. He catches sight of SERGEANT-MAJOR ADAM, the
      conference hut's young telephone operator.

<b>                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>             Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent
             call from Berlin...


<b>100   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                100
</b>
      A small room measuring 15 by 32 feet. Stifling heat.             
      We notice again that the windows are open to let in
      some air. Hitler and his officers hunch over a long,
      heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern
      Europe and the Soviet Union.

      LIEUTENANTS and SERGEANTS continually tiptoe in and
      out of the room. A GENERAL stands beside Hitler in
      the middle of his briefing:

<b>                           GENERAL
</b>             The Eastern Front forces are
             assured a victory... but they need
             reinforcements.

      In other words, they are getting pounded but he can't
      say that. The General is relived to be interrupted by
      Keitel's arrival. The briefing stops momentary as:

<b>                            KEITEL
</b>             Please pardon our tardiness... You
             remember Colonel Stauffenberg?
<b>
</b><b>                                                   77.
</b>


Hitler makes a deliberate effort to shake
Stauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock - an unnerving
moment. Stauffenberg has come to kill this man
greeting him. The moment is broken when the General
clears his throat, continuing his presentation.

<b>                     GENERAL
</b>       As you can see, Mein Führer, the
       situation in the East Prussian
       sector is increasingly critical...
                 (and on and on...)

Freyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes
him by the arm, moving him to his place at the table -
less than half a step from Hitler. He is squeezed in
between two other officers. We suck in wind when we
see who one of them is...

COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried
the bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long
ago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook.

Freyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg -
bumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the
briefcase - long enough to make us nervous.

He watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down,
sliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible,
leaning it against the heavy wooden table support
immediately to the right of Hitler's foot.                 

Stauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at
his watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the
telephone operator. Where is his God-damn phone call?

Around him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear
nothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat
in his own ears - the only thing betraying his
otherwise outward calm.

He looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under
his feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we
stay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it.

Stauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm.
The annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear.
Keitel sees this, irritated by the interruption.
Stauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand,
indicating a phone call. Keitel is not pleased.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          78.
</b>



<b>101   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       101
</b>
      Freyend leads Stauffenberg to Adam who offers the
      telephone receiver.

<b>                             ADAM
</b>             General Fellgiebel, sir. He says
             it's urgent.

      Stauffenberg takes the phone and stares at Freyend
      and Adam - they get the idea that this is a private
      call and leave. When they are gone, Stauffenberg
      simply lays the receiver down and walks out. Fast.

      A moment later, Adam returns to the room. He sees the
      receiver laying there. Odd. Looking down the hallway
      he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building.

      Then he notices Stauffenberg's hat and belt still
      hanging outside the briefing room.

<b>                        ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>             Colonel... Colonel, you forgot your-


<b>102   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                 102
</b>
      Hitler leans on his elbows carefully studying the map
      before him as the General's presentation drags on.

      Brandt moves in closer, filling the void left by
      Stauffenberg. His foot hits something. He looks at:

      Stauffenberg's briefcase as it falls over.

      Slowly, Brandt reaches down, picking up the
      briefcase, looking around for Stauffenberg. He
      considers the bag for a moment and we are sure he is
      going to open it.

      But then he puts it back under the table. But now the
      heavy wooden support is BETWEEN Hitler and the bomb.

<b>                           GENERAL
</b>             ...And now I believe Colonel
             Stauffenberg will present us with
             his deployment for the Replacement
             Army should the unthinkable occur
             and the Russians reach-

      Where is Stauffenberg? Keitel shoots Freyend a look.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          79.
</b>



<b>103   INT. CONFERENCE HUT - HALLWAY - DAY                       103
</b>
      Freyend steps into the hall. No sign of Stauffenberg.
      Sergeant Adam approaches, looking confused.

<b>                           FREYEND
</b>             Where the hell is Stauffenberg?

      But Adam shrugs, holding out Stauffenberg's hat.


<b>104   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING - DAY          104   
</b>
      Fellgiebel and Haeften watch anxiously as
      Stauffenberg clears the security checkpoint and walks
      toward them, slow and deliberate - eerily calm.                   


<b>      INT. CONFERENCE HUT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY                         
</b>
      Hitler at the far end of the room, bent over the                  
      conference table, leaning on his elbows.                          

      A MASSIVE, EAR-SPLITTING EXPLOSION lifts the table                
      up, throwing Hitler back and simultaneously                       
      vaporizing the men standing on either side of him.                


<b>      EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - CONFERENCE HUT - DAY                           
</b>
      The hut explodes outward like a house of cards.                   
      Bodies are thrown clear. Everyone hits the deck
      except Stauffenberg. He just keeps walking.                       

      A great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins. The                
      sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and
      ash. STUNNED OFFICERS are running about. Shouting.
      Screaming. Absolute chaos.

      Even knowing it was coming, Haeften is stunned.
      Stauffenberg walks up to the communications building
      and takes him by the arm, turning to Fellgiebel.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>             Contact General Olbricht in Berlin.
             Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed
             with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever
             all communications.

      Fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call.
      Stauffenberg leads Haeften to their waiting car -
      still driven by young Lt. Kretz.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        80.
</b>

      He too is stunned by the explosion - so much so that
      he does not think to get out and open the door for
      his passengers. Stauffenberg climbs in next to Kretz,
      pushing Haeften in the back.

<b>                      STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>                             (to Kretz)

                           (Kretz lingers)
<b>             LIEUTENANT.
</b>
      Kretz snaps out of it and jams the car in gear,
      speeding off down the forested trail. Stauffenberg
      and Haeften look back for a clear view of the total
      destruction. Bodies are carried out of the demolished
      hut - the grounds littered with the wounded.

      Surly there is no way the Führer could have survived.


<b>105   INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - DAY                           105

      Fellgiebel holds a phone to his ear.

<b>                   FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE)
</b>             I said Olbricht. General Olbricht
             at the War Ministry. The call is
             urgent.

      A breathless COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER enters, pointing
      in mute shock to the ruin outside.

<b>                    COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
</b>             What the hell just happened?

<b>                          FELLGIEBEL
</b>             What does it look like? The Führer
             is-

      Fellgiebel freezes, something catching his eye.

      COME AROUND TO HIS P.O.V. Share his horror. Through
      the window, Fellgiebel has a clear view of the
      conference hut, or rather what's left.

      HITLER - limping, dazed, his clothes in tatters - is
      being led from the smoldering ruins. He is very much:

<b>                        FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D)

</b><b>                                                           81.

<b>106   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - INNER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         106
</b>
      Kretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first
      checkpoint. A barricade is in place. A GUARD
      approaches. Stauffenberg and Haeften hold up passes.

<b>                         STAUFFENBERG
</b>             We have to get to the airfield at
             once. Orders form the Führer.

      The guard signals his men to remove the barricade.


<b>107   INT. COMMUNICATIONS HUT - MOMENTS LATER                    107
</b>
      Fellgiebel waits to be connected to the War Ministry
      in Berlin. His Communications Officer awaits orders.
      This makes it hard for Fellgiebel to speak plainly.
      He plays up his distress for his audience.

<b>                   FELLGIEBEL (INTO PHONE)
</b>             I am calling from The Wolf's Lair
             with urgent news for the General.
             Something terrible has happened...

      Then he turns his back, lowers his voice.

<b>                     FELLGIEBEL (CONT'D)
</b>                          (whispering)

</b>             I'm sorry. Please come again.

      But Fellgiebel's officer is watching him, trying to
      hear. Fellgiebel has no choice but to hang up.

<b>                          FELLGIEBEL

      Olbricht anxiously hovers over Mertz who shouts into
      the phone.

</b>       I didn't hear you. Come again.

But it's no use. Mertz slowly hangs up the phone.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       Well, what did he say?

<b>                      MERTZ
</b>       I... couldn't be sure. It sounded
       as though he said... Hitler is
       still alive.

Olbricht clinches his teeth and starts sweating.

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       Get him back on the line.

<b>                      MERTZ
</b>       Sir... The bomb did go off. That
       much was clear. Fellgiebel's next
       step will be to sever all
       communications.

Olbricht is confused. Frozen.                               

<b>                  MERTZ (CONT'D)
</b>       Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit.

</b>       Then lie. Tell him Hitler's dead.
       Or arrest him. But do it now.                        

But Olbricht is frozen.

<b>                  MERTZ (CONT'D)

<b>                     OLBRICHT
</b>       I'm not doing anything until I talk
       to Fellgiebel. Get him back on the

Mertz shakes his head bitterly and dials, but he'll
never get through.

<b>109   EXT. WOLF'S LAIR - OUTER SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY         109

      Stauffenberg's car presses on through the woods
      toward the last security checkpoint, but numerous new
      road barriers are in place. This is not good.

      One SERGEANT KOLBE and TWO ARMED SOLDIERS step from
      the guardhouse, signalling Kretz to stop.

<b>                            KOLBE

<b>                         STAUFFENBERG

<b>                            KOLBE
</b>             I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are-

      Stauffenberg steps out of the vehicle and makes a
      beeline for the guardroom. Kolbe races after him.


<b>110   INT. GUARDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                110

<b>                         STAUFFENBERG
</b>             Get me General Keitel.

      Stauffenberg wipes a single bead of sweat from his
      brow. With the guards hovering over him, he turns and
      casually sits on the desk, blocking the phone with
      his body. He surreptitiously rests his hand on the
      telephone cradle, hanging up. He talks to no one.

<b>                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
</b>             Yes... General Keitel. Stauffenberg
             here. I can't get past the outer

      He looks at Kolbe. Kolbe swallows.

<b>                             KOLBE

      Stauffenberg holds out the phone - staring hard,
      bluffing harder. Kolbe considers the phone. Finally:

      Silence but for the chattering engine. Kretz is
      distracted by movement in the rearview mirror.

      P.O.V. IN REARVIEW MIRROR. Haeften rummages through
      his briefcase, removing objects Kretz can't make out
      - tossing them, one by one, into the woods. Haeften
      realizes he is being watched by Kretz in the mirror
      and shoots him a look. "Mind your own business."

      Kretz returns his attention to the road. But
      something just isn't sitting right with him...

      someone O.S. Although his wounds are superficial, he
      certainly took a beating in the blast.

      Forty-five precious minutes have slipped away.

      Mertz sits alone at Olbricht's desk, lighting a fresh
      cigarette with the remains of another. The ashtray
      says he's been at this for quite a while. He stares
      at the clock, as if attempting to will time forward.

      His eyes sweep across Olbricht's desk, past his
      files, his stationery, framed photographs of his
      family. Then he looks up at a portrait of Hitler.

      Mertz is struck suddenly with a notion. He looks
      again at Olbricht's desk. His stationery...

      "Fuck it."

      He grabs the stationery and feeds it into a
      typewriter.

      Awkward pause. A struggle with the soul. Then he
      hands over a sheet of paper.

      Again we are inside the nerve center of Nazi

      away. And again, Sgt. Helm is curious, watching:

      The TELETYPE OPERATOR looks up at Helm. "What do I
      do?" Helm glances over his shoulder to the uptight

      A light drizzle. A man jabbering in Italian O.S.

      We get our first good look at the demolished briefing
      hut. That anyone survived is a miracle. Officers
      crowd around the smoldering ruins, the Führer himself
      heading this procession. He wears new clothes,
      nodding, smiling politely to the jabbering Italian
      O.S. A slight wince is the only indication that he
      was damn near blown to bits just hours ago.

      COME AROUND TO REVEAL none other than BENITO

      HITLER'S P.O.V. Blissful silence. Mussolini's

      Three hours have passed since the explosion.
      Stauffenberg and Haeften alight from the plane. The

      Haeften walks over to the office. Stauffenberg looks
      around the airfield. The silence slowly becomes
      unnerving. He goes after Haeften.

      Olbricht storms in, furious. He stands over Mertz,
      waving a document in his face - the very same
      document Mertz typed on Olbricht's stationery.

<b>                             OLBRICHT

      Before a fuming Olbricht can respond, the phone
      rings. Both men look at it - Olbricht is afraid to
      answer. Mertz shakes his head and picks up.

Olbricht sits, color draining from his face. A real
"what have I done" moment.

Stauffenberg pounds his fist on the wall, furious -       
for the first and only time showing us a crack in his     
ultra-cool exterior. He collects himself and looks at     
his watch.

      Silence. With shaking hands, Olbricht moves the
      portrait of Hitler, exposing a hidden wall safe from
      which he removes, at last, a thick folder marked:

      He looks at Mertz.

      up the phone and dials. After a beat, he reads from

      Skeptical, Haans snatches the paper from Helm. When
      he looks up, the entire staff is looking at him, some
      with tears in their eyes - others perhaps hiding a
      sense of relief.

      A phone rings. Then another. The chattering teletypes
      seem to surge into another gear as news of Hitler's
      death starts to spread.

      the moment.

      Zombie-like, the Operators go back to their
      teletypes, passing orders along.

      But one Operator - the one Helm asked to keep him
      informed - notices something strange about one order            
      in a stack of many he is sifting through.                       

<b>                           OPERATOR

             That's ridiculous. He`s not even in
             the army anymore.

      But sure enough, there is Witzleben's name. Strange.
      Helm looks over at the devastated Haans, wondering
      how to handle this. Then, like a good little Nazi:

      CLOSE ON: Lt. Herber, who sees Stauffenberg as the
      model Nazi, is more shocked by this than the news of
      Hitler's death.

      Stauffenberg, Mertz and Olbricht march with great
      purpose. They are joined by Beck, coming the other
      way, wearing a plain dark suit. It is moving to see

      Certain? Stauffenberg can see the private fear in               
      beck's eyes. But before he can answer, he is                    
      interrupted by a gasp O.S. as Olbricht opens the door           
      to his office, stepping back in shock. The others
      turn to see what it is...


<b>133   INT. WAR MINISTRY - OLBRICHT'S OFFICE - DAY             133
</b>
      Looking out at the shocked faces of Olbricht, Mertz,
      Beck and Stauffenberg. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

      Olbricht's office is packed to the four walls with
      GERMAN OFFICERS - all of them standing in silence,
      looking at the leaders of the Resistance with great
      respect. Stauffenberg walks in and the crowd parts,
      solemn and silent, nodding and whispering thanks.

      A YOUNG OFFICER steps forward. He looks hauntingly
      like the Lieutenant who drove Stauffenberg in Africa.

<b>                        YOUNG OFFICER
</b>             Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. We're
             reporting for duty.

      Stauffenberg is moved beyond words. Suddenly, what
      was once a small clutch of discarded generals and
      politicians is now a movement of motivated men.
      Stauffenberg nods, collects himself. In the crowd he
      finds Helldorf, the head of the Berlin Police, whom
      we met earlier. At first he speaks quietly, humbled.

<b>                        STAUFFENBERG
</b>                         (shaking hands)
             Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you.
             We're getting a late start and we
             need all of the manpower we can
             muster. Can we count on the police?                      

<b>                          HELLDORF
</b>             There's a lot of talk that Hitler                        
             isn't really dead. Is this true?                         

      Awkward pause. Good question. The men in the room               
      share nervous glances. Then all eyes on Stauffenberg.           

<b>                         STAUFFENBERG
</b>             I can't offer you any guarantees.

</b>


      Long pause. PAN ACROSS the uneasy faces of the men in
      the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what
      Helldorf does before making their decisions. Finally:

<b>                             HELLDORF
</b>             I'm with you.

      Stauffenberg can barely hide his relief. There is a
      palpable shift in the room. One by one, the officers
      in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup.

<b>                         STAUFFENBERG

             task - we need simultaneous control
             of every government building in the
             city. Dismissed.

      The soldiers move, but Beck's voice stops them -
      surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man.

<b>                             BECK

      Again, we focus on Major Remer, Commander of the
      Deutschland Guard Battalion and always suspicious.

<b>                        HASE (CONT'D)

<b>                            REMER

</b>             These are the orders as they were
             presented to me, Major. Now move.

      Pause. Just before the pause becomes insolent, Remer
      clicks his heels and salutes, leaving. But the look
      on his face tells us he's hatching a plan of his own.

      You are right to be nervous.

      vehicles as they frantically cordon off the streets.

      SOLDIERS come out of various government buildings
      with SEVERAL NAZI GENERALS in custody, hands bound.
      They push them into waiting trucks.

      Meanwhile, PASSING CIVILIANS walk quickly by, trying
      to pretend they don't see anything. Years of Nazi
      rule have told them to mind their own business.

      ANGLE ON: A staff car - Major Remer in the back,
      watching the entire scene with cold eyes. Lt. Hagen
      emerges from the chaos on the streets.

             Minister Goebbels under arrest.

<b>                            REMER

She opens the door and motions to someone outside.
After a beat, the door is filled with an almost
classic looking Nazi - A FAT GENERAL bristling with
medals. He enters the room, confused when he sees
Olbricht at Fromm's desk.

<b>                   FAT GENERAL

<b>                   FAT GENERAL
</b>       I'd say there is a coup all right,
       but it's not the SS.

Olbricht offers a sheet of paper.

      Haeften and Mertz appear at the other end of the hall
      - pistols raised, blocking the General's path. With

      When they have him under control, Stauffenberg turns
      to the onlookers. He finds a familiar face in the

      from his desk drawer and leaves it within reach. Then
      he picks up the phone and dials. After a beat.

      in his hand. We hear a faint voice: "Hello?"

      With an eerie smile, Goebbels simply extends his arm,
      offering the phone to a confused Remer. Silence as
      the Major takes it, holding it to his ear...

</b>             Of course, Mein Führer.

      transmits orders. Sgt. Helm gingerly approaches Lt.

             another.

      a portrait of Hitler with equal parts disdain and
      reverence. The door suddenly opens.

      Herber enters, leading the handcuffed Fat General.
      Avoiding Fromm's gaze, he removes the restraints and
      turns to leave. But the wily Fromm can see the look

      Through the melee comes none other than Heinrich

      Goebbels and Himmler, two of the most evil men who
      ever lived, smile coldly. Being taken alive by this

      Goebbels turns to a nearby AIDE.

      Stauffenberg works frantically in a room full of
      officers - the energy here being the antithesis of
      Goebbels' office - the morale quickly waning.

      He ignores the radio, writing orders, making phone
      calls, fighting to keep the coup alive. But we know
      now his orders are hitting a dead end.

All eyes turn to find Witzleben. Hours ago he was a
civilian, now he is a pompous, know-it-all General.

<b>                     WITZLEBEN
</b>       The military districts are
       receiving contradictory reports.
       I've got men sitting around joking
       about whose turn it is to arrest
       whom. Neither the capital nor the
       radio network are under our
       control. And where are the troops?
       You'd think there would be some
       activity going on in this city.
                  (to Stauffenberg)
       The word is all over the street
       that Hitler is still alive. We
       trusted you and you failed us. You                   
       should have stayed. To be sure.                      

<b>                 OLBRICHT (O.S.)

       in Berlin? You?                                      

Finding his balls, Olbricht confronts Witzleben.

<b>                OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
</b>       The Colonel did more than any man

       blame it's-

       am the officer in charge. I am the                   
       man responsible. No one else.                        

Olbricht is moved and rightly so. Meanwhile:                

<b>                    WITZLEBEN
</b>       I'm going home to await my                           
       inevitable arrest.                                   

Witzleben turns, marching out. The room remains ill         
at ease, everyone having just witnessed a serious
blow to the Resistance. Those anonymous soldiers
present exchange glances of concern.

</b>       I'm sorry, Colonel.                                  

After a beat, Olbricht turns and leaves.

of the office.

      He looks at Stauffenberg in a new light now,
      something darker - no longer the admirer. He shares a
      look with TWO OTHER OFFICERS. A wordless
      understanding. He leaves and they follow.

      Olbricht helplessly watches troops surround the
      building below. It is only a matter of time now.

      He sits at his desk. With a long trembling sigh, he
      puts pen to paper and writes:

      "My dearest wife..."

      A commotion from the anteroom startles Olbricht and
      he drops the pen. A loud, shrill scream follows.

      The door bursts open to reveal Herber and his TWO
      COHORTS. They are supported by A HALF DOZEN ARMED
      SOLDIERS, all training their weapons on Olbricht.                 

      In the anteroom behind the soldiers we see Fraulein

      Stauffenberg and Haeften rush toward Olbricht's
      office, stopping when they see a MASS OF SOLDIERS
      surrounding the doorway. A chill runs down our spines
      when we see Herber talking to none other than Major
      Remer. Just then, he spots Stauffenberg and Haeften.

      BANG. A shot is fired. Stauffenberg and Haeften take
      cover in a nearby doorway. Haeften returns fire.
      Stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his
      right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers
      of his left hand. Awkward. Then he aims and fires.                

      Stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his
      good arm. He drops his gun, bleeding badly.                       

      But MORE SOLDIERS appear at the opposite end of the
      corridor. The loyal Haeften covers Stauffenberg with              
      his body, aiming to fire. But Stauffenberg stops him,             
      shaking his head. It's over. They toss down their                 
      guns. Boot-steps approach loudly O.S.                             

      As Stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring

             remember our last time together.                           

      The others bravely nod in agreement. But then:                    

<b>                             BECK
</b>             I'd like a pistol, please.

      Stauffenberg looks at Beck with surprise.

<b>                        BECK (CONT'D)
</b>             For personal reasons.

      Fromm thinks about it, then matter-of-factly hands
      Beck a pistol. Remer quickly steps forward.

<b>                            REMER
</b>             General, my orders are to deliver
             the prisoners alive.

<b>                             FROMM
</b>             Noted, Major.
                            (to Beck)
             Get on with it then.

<b>                             REMER
</b>             But, sir-

<b>                            FROMM
</b><b>             THAT WILL BE ALL, MAJOR.
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                  111.
</b>


Fromm glares at Remer who angrily backs down. Then he
turns to Beck and with a casual wave of the hand:

<b>                    FROMM (CONT'D)
</b>        Continue.

The moment is surreal. Beck, seated at the desk,
looks at each of his fellow conspirators. A look of
thanks, goodbye. With a badly trembling hand he
places the gun to his temple.

<b>                        BECK
</b>        I'm thinking of earlier times...

CLOSE ON: The conspirators turn away, unable to            
watch. Except Stauffenberg.                                

<b>BANG.                                                      
</b>
And as if none of the last minute has even occurred,       
Fromm turns to the other conspirators.

<b>                        FROMM                              
</b>        Very well then... A court martial,
        convened by me in the Führer's
        absence, has pronounced sentence:
        Colonel Mertz von Quernheim,
        General Olbricht, Lieutenant
        Haeften...
               (glaring at Stauffenberg)
        And the Colonel, whose name I will
        not mention, are condemned to
        death.
                      (to his men)
        Take them outside.

Remer is clearly upset by this. Herber, on the other
hand, seems clearer than ever. He nods to his men who
drag the conspirators out. Herber personally takes
Stauffenberg by the arm. The two men share a look.
Nothing needs to be said. Each has found his place.

Stauffenberg turns to confront Fromm. He is weak,
white from fatigue and loss of blood.                      

<b>                    STAUFFENBERG                           
</b>        The Führer will want to put us on                  
        trial, make an example of us. This                 
        won't win you any favor. And it                    
        won't hide you're involvement.                     

<b>                       FROMM                               
</b>        Involvement. I don't know what you-                
<b>
</b><b>                                                   112.

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG                             
</b>       You knew and you did nothing.                        
       You're just as guilty as we are.                     
       Even more so.                                        

<b>                      FROMM                                 
</b>       Spare me, Stauffenberg.                              

And those words bring a genuine smile to                    
Stauffenberg's face. He almost pities Fromm now.            

<b>                   STAUFFENBERG                             
</b>       No one will be spared.                               

And as Fromm motions for Herber to take Stauffenberg        
away, we hear music, faintly at first - accompanied         
by the subtle hiss and crackles of a phonograph... It       
is the piece Stauffenberg and Nina were dancing to          
one night long ago... Over this:                            

A voice. A man speaking in German - faint at first,         
crackling over the radio.

A series of images of the coup being reversed as the        
Nazis take back power, made all the more poignant by        
the lonely sound of the phonograph, the music slowly        
rising, growing clearer and eventually becoming score       
over the silent images of:                                  

Conspirators being rounded up and arrested. Among           
them are faces we recognize...

his informing INNKEEPER watches from the doorway.

      Military vehicles are hastily arranged in a semi-              
      circle - headlamps marking the scene in stark white
      light and long black shadows.

      Stauffenberg, Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz are marched          
      into the courtyard, squinting in the harsh light as            
      they are placed against the wall of the War Ministry.

      scramble to form a line opposite Stauffenberg and his

      CRANE UP and away as the music swells, as what is

      of an air-raid siren - the warning of allied bombers              
      coming to deliver their nightly assault on Berlin.
