<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               EXT. FOREST - DAY
</b>
<b>               DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE
</b>
               Muffled by the wet green forest.

               The very earth seems to tremble.

<b>               A RABBIT
</b>
               Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs 
               the air.

<b>               LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES
</b>
               VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR 
               SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion.

               A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death.

               A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched 
               over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE.

               For a moment the forest takes a breath.

               Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep 
               Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.

               A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.

               It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.

               Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias 
               indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.

               His face might be attractive, under other conditions.

               He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard-
               issue field jacket.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Where the hell are those Krauts?

               To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's "I'll Be 
               Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering 
               the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.

               He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and 
               tries to go over it.

               The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.

               The BACK TIRES spin.

               Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his 
               face. Assesses the situation.

               He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever

               the Jeep free. When --

               The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.

               The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls 
               in the mud.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Shit.

               Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on 
               foot through the forest.

<b>               EXT. CLEARING
</b>
               Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against 
               a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun.

               Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN.

               But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around 
               the corner of it.

               Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation.

               Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to 
               hear them but he watches their every move.

               They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their 
               Karabiners rest slung across their backs.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Bingo.

<b>               AGAINST THE TREE
</b>
               Kelly focuses himself.

               Then he shoulders his carbine.

               Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         "And so they buried Hector, breaker 
                         of horses."

               He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt 
               and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the 
               guards.

               Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see 
               him.

               But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.

               Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but 
               does not aim it.

               Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself 
               an easy target.

               Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get 
               himself killed.

<b>               EXT. BARN
</b>
               Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans, FIRES into 
               the air and waves --

               -- when from behind him comes a voice.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b><b>                              (O.S.)
</b>                         Eine maus findet den kase.

               Kelly whips around to face a third German, the OFFICER.

               His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young 
               face. Point blank range.

               Only - Kelly doesn't fire.

               He just lowers the pistol.

               The German smiles.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Kill me Adolf.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         Mien Prisoner!

               The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come 
               running.

               One of them yanks Kelly's hands behind his back and pushes 
               him into the barn roughly.

               Kelly doesn't struggle.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you 
                         waiting for? Kill me.

<b>               INT. BARN
</b>
               Kelly sits slumped in a chair, legs tied up. One of the 
               Germans shines a flashlight in his face. Kelly squints.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Come on you pussies. Let's get this 
                         over with.

               The German Officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain 
               pen.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                              (German accent)
                         You will write your mother. Tell her 
                         how you will die now.

               Kelly takes the pen and examines it.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Genuine Third Reich issue, no less. 
                         Nice work.

               The Officer pokes the paper.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         You will write. How you die alone.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         My mother and I don't have that kind 
                         of relationship.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                              (hisses)
                         Write.

               Kelly thinks about it for a minute - should he or shouldn't 
               he - but sighs and begins writing. After a few lines, the 
               Officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an 
               Infantryman.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         Enough. Now you will beg for your 
                         life.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         What don't you understand?

<b>                                     INFANTRYMAN
</b>                              (interrupts sheepishly 
                              in German accent)
                         The protocol says we should -

               The Officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker. He seems 
               to be getting a bit hysterical.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         I am the fucking protocol.
                              (to Kelly)
                         Beg!

               He and Kelly glare at each other.

               The Officer FIRES his Luger into the rafters.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         Beg - for - your - life!

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         You got to be kidding me.

               The Officer grabs his throat.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         Silence. Now I have a little fun.

               Kelly laughs. The officer slaps him. Kelly jerks away.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Now that's against the rules.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                              (sneers)
                         There are no rules in war.

               Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in 
               the shadows.

               Only Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly "keep talking" 
               while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                              (to Officer)
                         You've never killed anyone before, 
                         have you?

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         I shower in the blood of my victims --

               The GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated 
               pain and commence death throes.

               Quick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German 
               Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand.

<b>                                     GI
</b>                         No wonder you smell so bad.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         Don't shoot, please.

               The GI's eyes widen. He looks at Kelly.

<b>                                     GI
</b>                         Will you look at the manners on this 
                         guy?
                              (to German)
                         Remember to thank me when I kill 
                         you.

<b>                                     GERMAN OFFICER
</b>                         No, really, not in the neck -

               But the GI does anyway.

               The Officer SHRIEKS, grabs at his neck, and falls.

<b>                                     GI
</b>                              (to Kelly)
                         You all right?

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't 
                         going anywhere anyway.

<b>                                     GI
</b>                         You want me to give you a minute?

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         That's okay. They'll get me 
                         eventually. If you can't get killed 
                         in a war, when can you?

<b>                                     GI
</b>                         That's right. Look on the bright 
                         side.

               The GI holds out his hand.

<b>                                     GI
</b>                         Bart. Bart Bowland.

               Kelly takes the hand of the grinning all-American type guy.

               About his own age, but BART takes up more space.

               Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under

               Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against 
               the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas.

               The Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud.

               Kelly doesn't smile at this. He looks at the sandwiches and 
               puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious it's 
               downright angry.

               Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. He looks kind. A 
               bit ill-used by life. The phrase "rode hard and put away

               He finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile.

               Kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator. His back 
               tightens. He slams the door with his foot.

               is nothing new.

               A family of Chinese immigrants, the Lings, paints canvases 
               at long worktables. There's a MOTHER, father MAO, grandmother 
               XIOU-XIOU, SON and DAUGHTER.

               Finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles 
               against it. All of them are portraits of animals. Some have 
               on hats or clothes.

               Kelly's mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few strokes 
               with a paintbrush.

               Eve wears jeans. She's one of those young-looking mothers

               Mother Ling looks up at Kelly, who's scowling. She smiles 
               and nods, understanding.

               On the walls a poster for the Civil War miniseries next to 
               one of Led Zeppelin. Some maps. A globe. Models of fighter 
               planes and a set of old tin soldiers.

               Oh yeah, and his mom's ORIGINAL PAINTING, the one that started 
               it all, this one signed by her - a very intense looking pink 
               rabbit glaring out of the canvas with huge eyes.

               Kelly unpacks cat food.

               Thousands and thousands of little cans of it. It's hard to 
               keep the rows straight on the shelves.

               SARAH, the night cashier, stands at her register. She's plain-
               looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures 
               out who she is.

               Not another soul in the store. Sarah wanders over to Kelly's

               No one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker.

               As he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices LANCE -- 
               short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and 
               his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down.

               They kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of

               She shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window 
               and gazes out at the front walkway of the school. Her face 
               clears. Something's clicked.

               left.

               Kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking 
               lot to his Jeep.

               Lance steps out from behind an SUV and intercepts him.

               Lance grabs Kelly's arm and yanks it back. Kelly still seems 
               unconcerned.

               Suddenly he pulls away, but Lance keeps hold of his backpack.

               Lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at 
               it, gleeful.

               Lance walks away towards his car. Kelly runs after him.

               Lance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws the 
               backpack into his SUV. They STRUGGLE for a minute, until 
               Lance pushes Kelly away, gets in the car.

               Kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as Lance 
               drives off.

               Finally, Kelly gives up. Lance turns out of the parking lot 
               and HONKS the horn.

               Kelly shakes his head.

               Kelly hops out of his Jeep and walks towards the front of 
               the school.

               Lance is there, hanging out with Bridget and some of his Cro-
               Magnon FRIENDS.

               He wears a WW II CAP, overseas airborne style, obviously 
               Kelly's.

               The Cro-Magnons grunt approvingly at this witty repartee.

               Ooh. The Cro-Magnons laugh at Lance and EGG him on - "You 
               gonna take that?"/"He just called you a fag", etc.

               Lance frowns and grabs Kelly.

               Still holding on to him with one arm, he SLAPS Kelly hard 
               across the face with the other.

               Kelly's knees give a bit. Lance holds him up.

               Kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes. Tries to re-wet the 
               dry inside of his mouth with his tongue.

               He turns slowly and trudges up the stairs.

               Sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door.

               Kelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes. He looks 
               up and sees Tabby browsing the paintbrushes.

               He's suddenly nervous. He knocks over a few cans of thinner. 
               Almost leaves.

               Instead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite 
               hers and waits to catch her eye.

               It takes Tabby a second to recognize him.

               Tabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether 
               to believe him.

               Tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints.

               Kelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle.

                         question.

                         calling anything done since the 
                         Renaissance "painting." We might 
                         have a more experimental interaction 
                         with the picture plane, but our skills 
                         have suffered from it.

               In spite of herself, Tabby laughs at this. This gives Kelly 
               more confidence. He leans over the aisle to see what she's 
               looking at.

               Kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves, 
               knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them.

               Tabby signs the slip and takes the bag. She walks out, Kelly 
               with her, matches her pace, talking.

               Very yellow and pink. Kind of looks like castles.

               Kelly comes out of the kitchen with a glass of water in pajama 
               bottoms and a T-shirt. The TV's on static. He sees a FIGURE 
               sleeping on the couch and starts to walk through the room.

               Then he stops, sighs, and backtracks. He turns off the TV.

               Then he sees the empty bottle of wine next to the couch.

               Kelly looks around, worried. In this house an unresponsive 
               dad isn't necessarily sleeping. Should he wake up his mom?

               He shakes the figure slightly. It rolls over, only it's not 
               his dad. It's some scabby ADDICT. Kelly yanks his hand away.

               Kelly comes out, unfolds another chair and sits next to his

               telephone repairmen's tool hanging from his belt and a hard 
               hat on. Kelly carries a toolbox.

               He looks at Kelly. Then he holds up one finger and gestures 
               "go." They sneak hunched over towards the fence. A LITTLE 
               GIRL comes out of the house and stops when she sees them.

               Bart and Kelly look at each other. Bart takes the toolbox 
               and gestures to Kelly by pointing at the girl and covering 
               his mouth.

               Kelly peels off towards the girl while Bart continues across 
               the lawn.

               The girl starts to SCREAM. Kelly swoops up and covers her 
               mouth with his hand. He tucks her under his arm and runs 
               towards the opposite side of the house.

               He puts the girl down, still covering her mouth.

               Kelly gets up and starts to walk down the street, only - 
               Lance PULLS UP in his SUV.

               Kelly darts behind a parked car and watches Lance go into 
               the house.

               Lance comes right back out. He forgot something in his car.

               Kelly moves around the car, trying to keep it between him 
               and Lance.

               Bart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie. 
               He smiles at Lance, now coming back up the walk.

               Bart nods and tips his HARD HAT.

               Kelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until 
               Lance's house is out of sight.

               Then he gets in step beside Bart.

               either of them.

               Kelly hands her the rest of her stuff. They part ways.

               Kelly shoves a piece of paper into his pocket.

               Kelly feels the tubes of paint. Nervous. Squirts some color 
               out. Looks over his shoulder at her.

               He's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being

                         painting class?

</b>                         Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints.

</b>                         Oh? What's your real job?

               Kelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his canvas.

</b>                         That would be stock boy at the Shop 
                         Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky 
                         says, every employee is part owner. 
                         So you could say I'm a captain-of-
                         industry in training. Kind of 
                         capitalist larva.

</b>                         Only if you see the most magical 
                         part. Do you see?

</b>                         What?

               Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.

</b>                         One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly. 
                         First I'll have to be a pupa though. 
                         I figure I won't be going out much 
                         then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence 
                         of the insect world.

               Miner stares at Kelly. He can't tell what he might be making 
               fun of, or if it might be him.

</b>                         Whatever it takes to get you through 
                         the day.

               Kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though 
               Miner doesn't see it. He grabs Tabby's paintbrush and pulls 
               her to him.

                              (to Kelly)
                         I know you'll still be here.

               Kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint 
               on his canvas in exaggerated strokes.

<b>                                     TABBY
</b>                         I really shouldn't.

                         And it will get all crazy, and we 
                         won't have any time to ourselves.

</b>                         We will. I promise.

               Tabby kisses Miner. He realizes there's no convincing her 
               and sighs.

<b>                                     MINER

</b>                         Maybe. Probably.

               Miner looks at Kelly, who looks away.

               Then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves.

               Tabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while. Kelly moves 
               around to look at his canvas from different angles, like 
               he's copying what he thinks a painter would do.

<b>                                     KELLY

               Tabby stops and puts down her brush.

<b>                                     TABBY
</b>                         Just because he didn't want to picture 
                         you as a pupa?

                         Whether he wants to or not.

               Kelly paints.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Not that though. How he wanted you 
                         to stop.

<b>                                     TABBY
</b>                         He wants to be with me. What's so 
                         bad about that?

                         for you.

               Kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. He has a 
               hard time making eye contact with Tabby.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         No one should ever ask you to stop. 
                         If you stop, you might not be able 
                         to start again. Or you might start 
                         again, only things will be different.

                         the truth.

               She picks up her brush.

                         ask me about it. It makes me nervous.

               Kelly looks at her seriously.

               Awkward silence.

</b>                         What are you painting?

               Kelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode.

</b>                         Really, there are so many layers of 
                         - imagistic symbolism - that I really 
                         don't feel comfortable summing it 
                         up, but, well - it's a recurring 
                         dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket 
                         ship.

               Tabby stops painting.

                         She's riding it sidesaddle. She's 
                         got a fish tail, for chrissake. I 
                         haven't decided yet if she's got

                         talking about?

               Kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's 
               gesture.

</b>                         It doesn't matter. It's called being 
                         yourself.

                         exciting.

               Kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette. His gestures 
               slow down. He's taking this in. Then he shakes it off.

               He dips a brush into the ink and watches Xiou-Xiou's

                         bite the bullet and do the seating 
                         arrangement?

                         when you bite the bullet, it explodes 
                         in your mouth.

               Mathilda looks surprised. This could go either way.

                         Why, I've never thought about it 
                         before but that is a rather strange 
                         expression, isn't it? You wouldn't 
                         say, "Sooner or later you've got to 
                         put the grenade in your pants," would 
                         you?

               Everyone but Bart LAUGHS.

               Tabby throws Kelly a grateful glance, for getting her out of 
               a conversation she didn't want to have.

               Kelly sits in the car. Bart pumps gas. They talk through the 
               window.

</b>                         Of course it matters. Doesn't the 
                         truth matter?

               Bart grins.

</b>                         I don't know. You tell me.

               Kelly avoids this by getting out of the car.

</b>                         I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple

               Bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap.

               Just then he glances towards the gas station and sees EVE, 
               set up in the adjacent abandoned lot. She's got the van parked 
               there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around 
               on display.

               But Eve has seen him. She shields her eyes with her hand and 
               calls to him.

<b>                                     EVE

               Kelly backtracks towards the car.

</b>                         That woman's calling you.

               Eve walks over to them. Kelly can't get out of it.

               Eve smiles brightly.

</b>                         What a nice surprise. It's so nice 
                         to finally meet you.

               Bart is surprised but recovers his manners quickly, just 
               like he's been taught to.

<b>                                     BART
</b>                         Likewise. So, doing a little business?

               Eve laughs.

               Kelly shifts his weight from foot to foot. Eve looks at both 
               of them.

</b>                         Oh. Well - okay.

               Eve watches a car pull into the lot next to the van.

<b>                                     EVE
</b>                         I should go. But you boys should

                         I know your family must get tired of 
                         him.

               Kelly visibly bristles at the thought of his parents 
               entertaining Bart.

</b>                         Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway.

               Eve looks at Kelly. Then she runs back over to the van.

                         cute.

               Kelly rolls his eyes and gets back in the car.

               Kelly watches Bart pick through parts of his uniform.

               After the encounter with mom, he's retreated into himself.

                         He's got an explosives expert coming.

               Kelly doesn't say anything.

</b>                         What's up?

               Kelly runs his hand through his hair. He can't bring himself 
               to say what's really on his mind.

               Kelly picks up Bart's Colt and sights with it. Bart frowns.

               He knows Kelly's avoiding the real stuff.

               Bart keeps his head down, polishes intently.

               There he pauses, trying to decide what to do. Then he scowls.

               He goes around the corner. Towards Tabby's studio.

               couch next to her.

               Tabby turns her face to Kelly's.

               Kelly looks scared. He wants to retreat. But he calms himself 
               down.

               Long pause. Then -- Kelly kisses her. She kisses back and 
               they fall against the couch together.

               Bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler. He 
               looks up and freezes.

               Kelly comes out of Tabby's studio. He shuts the door carefully 
               and walks around the pool.

               Kelly doesn't see Bart.

               Kelly throws parts of his soldier's kit onto his bed from 
               corners of the room. The canteen underhand. The Jeep cap as 
               a free throw. This is the best day of his life.

               Until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door, still 
               crusted with mud.

               He flops on his bed. But he can't help it. Soon he's smiling 
               again. He gets up, gathers up the uniform, and tears out of 
               the room.

               Kelly and a half dozen other SOLDIERS stand or sit in the

               The A.D. walks over.

<b>               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KELLY'S ROOM - DAY

               Kelly lays in bed staring at the ceiling. There's a cut across 
               his eyebrow.

               Eve comes in carrying her car keys and sits on the bed.

</b>                         Well, you're going to have to. Your

                         up there?

               Eve plays with her keys. Then she stops.

</b>                         They think he has stomach cancer.

               Kelly feels the sensation of falling, like a dream.

               Then he snorts and rolls over, away from his mom.

<b>                                     KELLY
</b>                         Oh this is just perfect.

               Eve looks at the back of Kelly's head. She's tired but still 
               trying to deal.

<b>                                     EVE

                         what I just said?

               Kelly gets up. Puts his feet on the floor. His shoulders are 
               slumped.

<b>                                     KELLY

               He gets up and holds the door open for her. Eve looks at 
               him, heart heavy. She leaves.

               Kelly sits on the bed. Then he looks at the rabbit painting.

               He grabs it off the wall and SLAMS it backwards against the 
               floor so he doesn't have to look at it.

               The painting falls back against the bayonet fixed to Kelly's 
               rifle and TEARS.

               He KICKS it.

<b>               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Kelly angrily wrestles with giant boxes of paper towels.

               He RIPS open the box and they roll everywhere.

               Sarah watches from checkout. She comes over to help him pick 
               them up.

               Kelly stops what he's doing.

               Sarah drops the rolls she had in her hands.

               Kelly, still in his work clothes, comes in without knocking.

               He stops when he sees Tabby and Miner sleeping together on 
               the couch.

               Tabby opens her eyes.

               Kelly goes and takes his painting off the easel.

               Kelly stops and turns around.

               They stand there in the yard. Tabby wraps her arms around 
               herself.

               Tabby looks at Kelly, pained.

</b>                         Oh, Kelly.

               She takes a step towards him. He backs up.

               Kelly drives along an open stretch of road. He throws the 
               painting out of the Jeep.

               He comes to a turn and takes it much too fast.

               The Jeep SKIDS, teeters on two wheels, and goes over the 
               embankment.

<b>               BOTTOM OF DITCH

               Steam trails up from the Jeep's radiator. The front end is 
               completely smashed.

               Kelly bangs his fist against the steering wheel.

               Kelly closes his eyes. He had forgotten - or tried to forget.

               Mr. Norman looks at Kelly pleasantly.

               He looks down and thinks. He looks back up. The silence

               Then Mr. Norman comes out.

               Mr. Norman rushes over to them.

               Kelly scrambles up and rips at his bike lock, gets on his 
               bike and rides away.

               Mr. Norman tries to take a panting Lance by the arm but Lance 
               shakes him off.

               Kelly rides by his house and keeps going.

<b>               EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</b>
               Kelly stops and looks up at the hospital but can't bring 
               himself to go in. He pedals on.

<b>               EXT. CLEVELAND WATERFRONT - DAY
</b>
               Kelly sits on the loading dock of an abandoned factory.

               He watches the rusty barges glitter on the water. The wind 
               ruffles his sweaty hair.

<b>               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Kelly's at the front door.

               She closes the door. Kelly wheels his bike down the driveway.

               He sees Bart sitting out by the pool with a couple of LANGELY 
<b>               BOYS.
</b>
               Bart sees Kelly and ignores him, laughs at something one of 
               the guys says.

<b>               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

               Kelly sits on the toilet, putting a bandage on a red scrape 
               down his arm.

               Eve appears in the doorway.

</b>                         Oh Kelly. What happened?

               Kelly looks up at her. He's still got the cut eyebrow, which 
               has split back open, and some dried blood under his nose.

</b>                         Jesus. Let me see that.

               Eve comes over and tilts Kelly's head back to look at the 
               cut. This is the first time she's touched him.

               She gets some antiseptic and ointment from under the sink 
               along with Band-Aids and goes to work.

</b>                         Ow.

               Kelly lets her dab at his face. He closes his eyes.

<b>                                     EVE
</b>                         I'm going over to see dad.

               Kelly opens his eyes and pulls away.

               Eve puts a butterfly bandage across Kelly's eyebrow.

</b>                         And you need to come.

               Kelly pulls his head away.

</b>                         I don't want to.

               Eve looks at Kelly sadly.

               Eve rises to her feet. He's just sent her over the edge.

               She stops and breaks down.

               Eve looks at her son. Her face looks older.

                         deal with one thing at a time.

               Eve leaves. Kelly sits on the toilet, lost.

<b>               INT. KELLY'S ROOM - MORNING

               The sun shines in through Kelly's window.

               He's laying in bed awake - has been for a while.

               He gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately. He 
               puts on his best shirt and tie, sensing trouble when the 
               tie's too short.

               He pulls the suit out of his closet.

               The jacket doesn't fit. The sleeves don't even go down to 
               his wrists.

               And he can hardly button the pants. He rips off the jacket.

               He pulls everything out of his closet. Nothing there.

               He sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands.

               He looks at his DRESS UNIFORM, hanging on the back of the 
               closet in its dry-cleaning bag, right where his mom left it.

               He shakes his head. No, he couldn't do that.

               Then he sighs.

               It's decorated for a wedding. Flower garlands trail up the 
               banisters.

               GUESTS trickle in.

               Harrison, dressed in a suit with a boutonniere on his lapel, 
               talks to an USHER.

               Bart comes outside, also dressed as an usher.

               Bart walks down the steps and looks down the street.

               Kelly's walking towards him. IN HIS DRESS UNIFORM.

               Bart walks down the street to meet him.

               Kelly looks down. He can't meet Bart's eyes.

</b>                         It's not your wedding.

               Bart looks at Kelly and shakes his head.

</b>                         Why are you wearing that?

               Kelly doesn't answer.

</b>                              (softening)

</b>                         Because you know why. Just go home.

               Kelly finally looks up at Bart and nods.

               A Town Car pulls up.

               Tabby gets out in her wedding dress. Has there even been a 
               more glorious woman? Will there ever be again?

               Her MAID OF HONOR leads her around to the side of the church.

               Kelly watches every step.

               Kelly walks off.

               Kelly sits on the edge of the bed, head in hands.

               He sees the torn rabbit painting. After a minute, he picks 
               it up and looks at it.

               She examines it and takes out a wet sponge. She wipes it 
               across the back of the canvas.

               She works silently for a minute. Kelly watches her. She cuts 
               a small piece of canvas to repair the hole.

               Kelly nods slowly, taking this in. And it is finally too 
               much.

               He breaks down and cries. For the fear and the misplaced 
               rage, the fights and the stubbornness.

               But finally, relief.

               They walk back down the hall together. Eve reaches out and

               Kelly gives him a little ra-ra with one hand. Bart smiles.

               Kelly's been doing his research.
