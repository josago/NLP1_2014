              CLOSE on a mud-streaked AIRFIELD in mist and driving RAIN.
              A Lockheed ELECTRA sits. Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the-
              art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. Waiting.
              PULL BACK to see...

              ...our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open-
              sided, thatched roof BAR high above the airfield. And
              peering down through the mist and rain...

              ...a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane.
              Slender. Feminine. At first glance, fragile. Then the gray
              eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her.
              Something fierce lives there.

              in a reckless way. His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt-
              streaked as her own. He carries his bottle of tequila, and a
              Coke which he sets down for her.

                        by now.
              Her eyes study him.    Assessing something as he pours himself
              four fingers.

              His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila.
              She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her
              side of the table.

                        he knew could kick his tail?

              No response.   Just her clear direct gaze.

</b>              Alone by the window, he gazes at the city. A powerfully
              built man in a perfectly-tailored suit. The face at once
              strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now,
              there are none to be seen. Even as...
              ...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits
              respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad.
              Does he know she's there?

                        in that chair.
              The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down.   And

                        graceless or boring.
              He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease.

              being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as...

              His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. And one
              object, oddly out of place. A stuffed CAT, with boots and a
              green frock coat. It wears a confident ironic smile.

              and go. But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring
              through a small stack of volumes. As if preparing for an

          Now, SKYWARD by ADM. RICHARD BYRD. Photos of the explorer
          preparing for his flight over the North Pole. One of Byrd

          Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers,
          explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo of
          George with the great Lindbergh.
          A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises,
          smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down
          the corridor.

</b>                    I knew, of course, that he wasn't

                    discernible qualifications
                    whatsoever.
          They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER
          PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly
          pushes it open...
          ...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and
          suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him,
          negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of
          messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric,
          masterful.

                    any life of his own to flutter near
                    the famous.
          He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is
          there. Sit, please. But she doesn't.

          He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't
          move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze
          from him. He hangs up the phone.
          They stare at each other for a frozen beat.   He breaks the

                    the pilot. There'll be a male co-

                    Because your level of flying
                    experience wouldn't place you

</b>                    Because the hook is that we're
                    making the woman the commander.
                    The pilot will sign a contract
                    saying he is under her direction
                    and control. It's her ship, her

               a sea-plane with golden wings. Its red-orange fuselage
               stands beside gigantic PONTOONS, each 29 feet long. The
               pontoons have been opened, and the men are attaching them to
               the plane.
               They turn toward us now. BILL STULTZ is short and wiry with
               quick eyes. Only 28, he seems weathered by his adventures
               and the streaks of gray through his hair. He is not
               necessarily happy to see us.

          George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins
          moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to
          Lindbergh's angle.

               She glances to where a WOMAN, beautiful and aristocratic, is
               being helped onto the roof. George's face lights to see her.
               He rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her
               tenderly. Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them

               place, Amelia and her dinner companions are being served
               lobsters. GENE VIDAL leans to Amelia as he speaks, and she

</b>                         Transcontinental was too ambitious.

               Gene reaches over, as if it were his own plate, and begins
               cracking her lobster for her. She looks in his eyes and

</b>                     Gene had a terrible marriage and

                     adulterous wife. But he was too
                     kind to humiliate her with a

</b>                     Actually, she hasn't been feeling
