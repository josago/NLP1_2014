          We see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be the
          inner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the
          scientist, in a white coat.
<b>          
</b>           We pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicated
          MULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with
          the MACHINE. The Scientist makes an elaborate multi-level
          move. The Machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but
          then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.
<b>          
</b>          We pull back further to see the back and legs of the
          DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The
          regime's emblem can be seen on the uniforms.

</b>          We're on the machine, which is clicking and jerking as it
          malfunctions.

          We turns to leave. We hear the clicking of boots as the
          soldiers accompany him out.
<b>          
</b>          We see the scientist's dejected face as he comes towards the
          camera to turn it off.

</b>          The grainy footage rolls again; we see the scientist moving
          away from the camera (having just turned it on).
<b>          
</b>          The lab is shadowy, late at night. We see his worktable for
          the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously
          filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor
          is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the
          worktable. Nearby is a small old-fashioned tiny little box.

<b>          
</b>          He gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though
          for good luck. He picks the TALISMAN up off the table. He
          moves over to insert the talisman into the port of the
          machine.
<b>          
</b>          His back to us, he faces the machine. We see him putting
          something over his face (but only from behind).
<b>          
</b>          There is a sudden FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT and the machine JOLTS,
          and then suddenly, starts up...lighting up, electricity
          crackling, parts moving in smooth coordination, etc.
<b>          
</b>          The scientist waits, watching. The machine continues to run.
          Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously.
<b>          
</b>          The scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets
          up and comes towards camera.
<b>          
</b>          We see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us:
          CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks
          sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated.
<b>          
</b>          Pull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new
          sort of energy. Something new has happened.
<b>          
</b>          The scientist switches off the camera and:

</b>          The machine zips through the complex 3-D chess game at
          lightning speed, checkmating the scientist in seconds as the
          Dictator watches.

          The scientist laughs fondly and pats the machine.

          flash goes off: someone is taking a picture O.S.

</b><b>          
</b>          9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted
          RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war.
<b>          
</b>          Pulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered
          clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human
          civilization surround him.
<b>          
</b>          He sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front
          seat of a car.
<b>          
</b>          Banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on
          them.
<b>          
</b>           achines lie deserted on the sides of roads.
<b>          
</b>          Distracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged
          old flyer: REVOLT!    He looks back at the War Machines and
          Dictator flags.    He sees a vandalized poster of what appears
          to be a dictator/leader.
<b>          
</b>          9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.
          Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.
<b>          
</b>          9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war
          Machine.
<b>          
</b>           LOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.
<b>          
</b>          Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a
          piece of metal lying in front of him.
<b>          
</b>          The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure
          emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him
          with all his might.
<b>          
</b>          9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2
          is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris
          behind him. 9 quickly tries to hide.

<b>          
</b>          9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He
          hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his
          hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid,
          but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to
          help 2 up.
<b>          
</b>          We see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more
          primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of
          OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is
          tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him.
          His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of
          eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat.
<b>          
</b>          9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see
          that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a
          contagious eagerness and imaginativeness.
<b>          
</b>          2 peers eagerly at 9.   He circles 9 and spots the number on
          his back.

<b>          
</b>          He nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9's hand.
          While doing this, he takes 9's hand and studies it, nodding
          with eager excitement. We see that 9's hand is more
          sophisticated than 2's.

          unzips himself and 2 peers in. 2 looks up, happy that he can

<b>

          cart covered with detritus - odds and ends, a broken china
          doll.

          one of its jagged claws and looks at it quizzically.

</b>          We see the Cat Beast has picked up the entire tin can and is
          smashing it to get at what's inside it.   Failing, it hurls
          the tin can aside.

          gestures to him to continue without him.

          Fabrication Machine has constructed) floating in the air
          around the factory, tirelessly looking for enemies. One of
          them floats near to camera and its searchlight fixes on
          something. We follow the light down.

          Its pump moves up and down in sinister rhythm.

          following the light and keeps moving down, arriving at the

          Seeker Drone to pass. 1 is weak, but is supported by 5, who
          has been patching him, and is just finishing up, pulling the
          last thread out of the patch he's sewn onto 1. 1 is
          regaining his strength. The twins huddle behind 6.

          runs out from cover, over to a huge barrel that lies half
          buried in the scorched earth.    A painting of the Dictator's
          symbol is stenciled on the side.

          spots a remnant of the FABRIC used to create the Winged
          Beast. We see he is formulating a plan. He darts his hand

          and now, just as 9 could only watch 8's soul being sucked
