               In the winter of 1982 these men were commissioned by the 
               United States National Science Foundation to gather data 
               concerning the physical and natural sciences on the continent 
               of Antarctica.

<b>                          THE MAIN COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31
</b>
               The interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways, 
               passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and 
               compartments within the compound. Sturdy, but prefabricated 
               materials have been used in its construction.

               There is a laboratory. An infirmary. A kitchen and mess hall. 
               A communications room and sleeping quarters. Other cubicles 
               are for storage and supplies.

               The most spacious area of the building, and the main center 
               of activity, is the Rec Room. Of the many entrance ways to 
               this room can be seen the small work chambers with their 
               sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment.

               The below quarter houses the generator and still other 
               compartments for storage.

               A long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the 
               dog kennel.

<b>               A STARRY BLACKNESS
</b>
               From out of the billions, the smallest of specks drives slowly 
               forward. It closes; getting larger; its features becoming 
               more identifiable: a vessel. Flip-flopping; out of control. 
               Its stern roaring with flame. It passes; its blue fire surging 
               into the screen.

</b>
<b>               A SOUND
</b>
               Loud and strident. A helicopter streaks across frame. It 
               travels precariously close to the ground; its chassis battered 
               and swayed by the wind.

<b>               INT. COPTER
</b>
               Red dials beam on the faces of two men. One carries a rifle 
               and searches the horizon with binoculars. The other pilots. 
               Their unkempt faces, their blazing eyes notate a wildness. 
               They bark at each other in some Scandinavian tongue. Two men 
               arguing like mad and desperate children.

               The man with the binoculars sights something.

<b>               EXT. HORIZON - BINOCULARS' POV - A DOG
</b>
               It turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards 
               to its rear. Then whirls and gallops off. A gun blast kicks 
               up snow at its heels.

<b>               INT. COPTER
</b>
               Another blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his 
               prey. The pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and 
               implores for better aim. The craft swoops lower and the engine 
               is put into full throttle.

<b>               EXT. HILL - THE DOG
</b>
               running feverishly up and over a hill of ice. A weather- 
               beaten, wooden sign sticks up on the other side:

<b>                     U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION -- OUTPOST #31

               A rifle blast kicks up more snow.

<b>               EXT. COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31
</b>
               A large, almost snow-covered building. Not far from that a 
               tall, meteorological balloon tower.

               A scattering of several small shacks at varying distances 
               from the main compound. The smaller hovels are connected by 
               wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. Multicolored 
               pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions 
               to outdoor experiments.

               A tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds 
               of continuously mounting snow.

<b>               TWO MEN, NORRIS AND BENNINGS
</b>
               standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the 
               process of letting up a large red balloon. Childs, a hefty 
               black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. 
               Their beards are caked with ice. It is winter and it is harsh.

               The faint sound of the copter turns their attention.

<b>               THE COPTER
</b>
               flying ever lower now. The man with the gun leans dangerously 
               outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost.

<b>               THE MEN
</b>
               outside the compound look to one another, incredulous.

<b>               THE COPTER
</b>
               much too low now, and chastised by the wind, attempts a high-
               speed landing, directly on the heels of the sprinting dog.  
               It bounces violently on the hard-packed surface.

               Once. Twice. Passing the dog.

               A third bounce sends it skidding. It flips; its blades 
               snapping off like toothpicks. It lands belly-up, soundless 
               except for the whine of its engine.

               The man with the gun rolls out before the explosion.

<b>               INT. MAIN COMPOUND
</b>
               The half a dozen men, playing cards, monitoring equipment, 
               listening to music -- spring to their feet, startled.

<b>               EXT. COMPOUND
</b>
               The dog reaches Norris and Bennings, as they awkwardly wade 
               through the snow, toward the downed copter.

<b>               THE SURVIVOR
</b>
               of the crash, his eyes crazed with determination, struggles 
               to his feet. Heedless of his companion, he double-times his 
               way to the men and the dog. He reloads his gun and bellows 
               in his Scandinavian tongue.

               Norris and Bennings have no idea what he is saying.

               The survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off, screaming 
               as he does so; his face now caked with blood.

               The two men are bewildered. The dog jumps up, licking and 
               pawing them, imploring for safety.

               Blam!! The visitor fires. The men jump back in disbelief.

<b>                                     NORRIS
</b>                         What the fu...

               Blam! Blam! The crazed visitor screams and fires as he stalks 
               after them. His countenance ablaze, mad. Ice and snow kick 
               up about the terrified Americans. A bullet smacks into the 
               dog's hip, sending it skidding and howling in pain.

               Childs, the black man by the snowmobile, takes cover, diving 
               behind his machine.

               Bennings is hit. Norris pulls, drags him back toward the 
               compound. The dog crawls along beside them.

               The intruder is relentless in his assail. He runs, screaming, 
               firing, screaming, reloading and firing.

<b>               INT. COMPOUND
</b>
               Total confusion. Some watch helplessly through the small, 
               fogged-up and translucent windows. Others try to mobilize 
               grabbing for their heavy jackets.

               as it efficiently breaks through a windowpane and into the 
               cold. A steady hand grips it firmly.

<b>               THE SCANDINAVIAN
</b>
               getting closer. Kablam! Suddenly, his head jerks back. He 
               falls to his knees and then face down into the snow.

<b>               NORRIS AND BENNINGS
</b>
               stare blankly, but relievedly at the fallen man. The dog 
               whimpers in pain.

               pokes his head out from under the snowmobile.

               The rumbling of voices fades. The men adjust their eyes to 
               station manager Garry, as he extracts his gun from the broken 
               window, relieves it of its spent shell and puts it away.

               A neat round hole is set in the middle of his forehead.

               Station manager Garry holds up something akin to an ID.

               Fuchs, a young and sensitive-looking biologist, stands closest 
               to the large area map of Antarctica. Several men sit and 
               stand around viewing the body that lies on two brought-
               together card-tables.

               Garry directs his attention to Childs, the large black man 
               who had been working on the snowmobile. Next to him sits 
               Norris, the rugged-looking, fortyish, geophysicist, who was 
               one of the men being shot at.

               mending the hip of the wounded dog off in the corner.

               Bennings lets out with an ouch.

               of the many narrow hallways that connect the various 
               compartments of the main compound. He is black, a little 
               mischievous, about twenty-two.

               He comes to a flashy skidding stop at one of the entrances 
               to the rec room area, where the men are gathered with the 
               dead Norwegian.

               Norris, bundled in his sixty-five pounds of clothing, exits 
               the main compound. He walks the prefab wooden planks up the 
               precipice; his destination is someone a hundred yards up the 
               slope -- to a shack. He grabs onto the steadying ropes and 
               pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet.

               MacReady takes a sip of his drink; makes his way over to his 
               electronic chess game. A large Mexican sombrero hangs on his 
               back. He is tall; about thirty-five. His shack is sparse but 
               unkempt. A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by 
               an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South American 
               paradise.

               The chess game is of larger than normal size. The pieces 
               move automatically with the press of a button. He sits down 
               and chuckles over his opponent's bad move.

                         starting to lose it, aren't you?

               He confidently taps out his move. His companion's response 
               is immediate.

               MacReady's grin slowly fades as he examines the board. There 
               is a pounding at his door. MacReady broods for a bit, heedless 
               of his visitor and makes his next move.

               More impatient pounding. MacReady glares at his opponent for 
               a beat. He bends forward, opens up a flap containing the 
               chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. There ensues 
               a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the 
               machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish.

               MacReady gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the 
               door.

               MacReady fights violently with the controls as he struggles

               Pull back to reveal the camp itself: resembling the aftermath 
               of a western fort, sacked and ravaged by Indians.

               Small fires and debris are strewn everywhere. The prefab 
               Administration Building exposes gaping holes. Smoke rises 
               from the almost entirely snow-buried Quonset huts. Embers

               Curious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within

               A small can of gasoline lies nearby. A large oil drum not

               MacReady turns to view the Norwegian compound. He then

               MacReady and Dr. Copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of

               slowly pushes it open with his gun. A creaking. A long pitch-
               black corridor. Copper shines a flashlight.

               The two men move slowly. It is dank and cold. Their breath, 
               bleating like exhaust. A soft, steady wind howls overhead.  
               The flashlight is not much help.

               Further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get 
               closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door 
               at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from 
               within.

               The face of the door has been shredded. An ax sticks out 
               from its middle. MacReady wrenches out the ax. There is blood 
               on it. The men acknowledge this for a beat.

               MacReady tries the knob. It opens slightly. Something is 
               blocking it from the other side.

               like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and 
               shines the flashlight.

               It is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed 
               in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the 
               radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room.

               A beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman 
               lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter 
               light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio 
               chair.

               The chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch 
               closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor.  
               He pokes his gun at the chair's back.

<b>                                     MACREADY

               Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the 
               armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in 
               a pool of frozen blood on the floor.

               The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up 
               in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth.

               His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor 
               in his lap.

               MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the 
               other door. It is locked and barricaded.

</b>                         Come on, Copper.

               The two men free a machine-like obstacle from the other exit. 
               MacReady opens a lock and pushes the door open.

               More blackness. Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high 
               as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a 
               cavernous, underground causeway.

                         they're Norwegian, MacRe --

               Whap!! Something slaps into the Doctor's face from the 
               darkness. The lantern crashes to the ground. The Doctor 
               stumbles, falls. MacReady grabs the flashlight and whirls in 
               different directions. A panting beat. Silence.

               Dr. Copper holds up what hit him. A thick centerfold, buffeted 
               by the wind. MacReady takes it.

               MacReady pockets it for further viewing.

<b>               INT. THE NARROWEST OF CORRIDORS
</b>
               The supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked 
               from the constantly moving ice underneath. The evidence of 
               fire has further weakened the foundations. The wood creaks 
               overhead. Bits of ice and silt trickle down.

               The two men walk hunched, cautious. MacReady gingerly tries 
               to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam. He 
               brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning 
               roof.

               The two men wait until it subsides and then moves on.

               Further down. MacReady's knee bumps into something along the 
               wall, causing him to stumble slightly. He shines his light 
               on it.

               An arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off 
               the ground. The door has been slammed shut. The arm pinned, 
               its fist still gripping a small welding torch.

               The flame long since gone out.

                         Holy shit...

               He tries the door. Unlocked. It opens. The arm drops to the 
               ground. It has been severed by the force of the slam.

               Its owner is nowhere to be seen.

               MacReady, sickened, coughs. Dr. Copper mumbles.

               They step over the arm and into another slim passageway.

               Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with 
               Norwegian lettering on it.

               MacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly 
               about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. 
               The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the 
               small room with his flashlight.

               Copper makes his way over to the main work table. He shuffles 
               through papers, glancing at the writing.

               Dr. Copper bends down and begins gathering the papers, strewn 
               about the room.

                         going to check the last few rooms.

               He exits. Amongst the rubble, Dr. Copper finds a pocket tape 
               recorder and several cassettes. He selects a tape and is 
               about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear. He 
               turns. Looks. A beat. Nothing.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady shoves himself into another room.

<b>               INT. ROOM
</b>
               Debris and wood flush down on him. The receding ceiling had 
               been blocking the door from above. He brushes his coat and 
               shines the light upwards.

               The ceiling is a shambles. He then shines the light deeper 
               into the room.

<b>               INT. NORWEGIAN LAB
</b>
               Dr. Copper is playing the small tape recorder. A casual 
               Norwegian voice drones on as if making notes. He fast 
               forwards. The same casual drone.

<b>               INT. ROOM
</b>
               Dr. Copper enters, squeezing in, through the door. The wood 
               cracks overhead. More debris comes falling down.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Careful. It's about to go.

               Copper dusts himself. MacReady stands before a huge block of 
               ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall.

               It has partially melted, but its thawing process has been 
               stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost.

               Its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and 
               scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. 
               The two men study it uncomprehendingly.

               MacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. 
               He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted 
               to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and 
               play.

               He tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling 
               is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, 
               careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. Bits of 
               dust float down.

<b>                                     DR. COPPER
</b>                         Watch it.

               His grip is too strong. It gives suddenly, unexpectedly. The 
               large metal door flies open.

               Large chunks splash from the ceiling. They come thumping to 
               the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. 
               MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. 
               Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear.

               His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the 
               inside of the cabinet door.

               It is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, 
               toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen 
               block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The 
               block looks much thicker. Its interior opaque.

               MacReady looks to the block of ice and then back to the 
               photograph. He untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door.

               An armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing 
               door. Dislodged from the ceiling, the body and MacReady go 
               crashing to the floor.

               The loud beat of Warren Zevon's song, "The Werewolves of 
               London," can be heard throughout the compound. The room is 
               empty. Close on a video pong game, its ball of light lazily 
               traveling back and forth. The dog, its tail wagging, its 
               bandage on, walks by.

               Zevon's record is blasting from Nauls' stereo. He skates 
               from the big walk-in freezer and plunks down a large side of 
               beef on the wood-cutting table to thaw. He skates from pot 
               to pan keeping time with his sounds.

               He smells. Tastes. Adds a little something here, a touch 
               there. He clearly enjoys his work.

               Station Manager Garry stops past the open door.

               An empty hallway. Larger than most. Doors to several sleeping 
               quarters on either side. The dog slowly walks through.

               One of the doors is open up ahead of his left. The dog stops 
               in front of it and looks in. Someone is inside.

               Inside the small cubicle, a slight portion of a man's back 
               can be seen as he sits bent over a chair; his large shadow 
               displayed on the wall.

               Back in the corridor. The dog looks up the hall once and 
               casually to the other end. No one. He enters the room. The 
               sound of a man's voice, too indistinct to tell whose, mumbles:

               is slammed shut from the inside. And then silence.

               around the compound. He stops at the end of a long Quonset 
               hut almost completely buried in the snow. The hut is fifty 
               yards long and connects to the main compound. He enters a

               and trots toward the compound through the long narrow tunnel. 
               He passes and waves to Clark, who rolls along a wheelbarrow 
               of dog food.

               near the fuel supply bladders. Older and more rickety than 
               the quarters above.

               Childs waltzes through, humming, a big smile on his face.

               He stops at a door with six locks on it. Different kinds.

               Combination locks, key locks, etc. He opens each one 
               separately.

<b>               INT. STORAGE ROOM

               Inside are several marijuana plants. Sun lamps beam down on

               He waters them carefully, as Al Green sings softly. He hears

               The dog, who has entered the shed, has jumped on the work 
               table and upended the tool box on its eagerness to look out 
               of the above window. Palmer curses under his breath and calls 
               out.

               heavy winds and lands safely.

               Garry, MacReady, Dr. Copper, Norris, Bennings, Blair and his 
               assistant, Fuchs, are present. The small Norwegian video 
               unit has been set up and its contents are being viewed on a 
               TV screen. Grainy, home movie-ish, no sound.

               The proceedings are grim.

               Shots of the Norwegian's at work. Others of them playing 
               soccer on ice. Generally the footage is a prosaic record of 
               their day-to-day life.

               Norris shuffles the bundle of notes Dr. Copper brought back 
               with him.

               The present footage is a shot of them all naked and probably

               outdoors in super-freezing weather.

               MacReady turns on the light and shuts off the video machine.

               Dr. Copper fast forwards. The calm voice continues. And then 
               a loud blast, followed by pounding. The sounds of confusion. 
               Voices. Loud. Frenetic. Men's feet running up and down wooden

               din of wild, carnage-wrought cries. And then more screeching. 
               A screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard.

               Dr. Copper and MacReady begin dumping the heavy contents of 
               a large plastic trash bag onto the slab.

<b>                                     DR. COPPER
</b>                         We found this.

               Displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a 
               man. Badly charred. What is left of the trousers and shoes 
               of the bottom torso are ripped and split, as if his legs and 
               feet had burst from the inside. His upper body is an almost 
               undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush.

               The head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal. 
               It is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen. 
               Tendon-like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and 
               sticking up and out in odd postures. One is wrapped around 
               the body's left leg.

               The shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar-like 
               mess.

               The men grimace.

               Bleary-eyed, MacReady is in the process of blowing up some 
               strange inflatable object. As he puffs away, he still keeps 
               an eye on the Norwegian video tapes. His balloon begins to 
               take shape. It blossoms into a life-size replica of a full-
               breasted woman. Something on the tape catches his eye. He 
               rewinds, then starts it forward again.

               The screen shows the Norwegians on the surface of what appears 
               to be an enormous, flat glacier. They are spread out on the 
               ice around a large odd oval shape; their arms outstretched.

               It fades to black and then a Norwegian comes on mugging 
               childishly in front of the camera, apparently quite pleased 
               with something.

               The tape fades to black again and the picture reappears.

               This time they have marked off the large oval area with flag 
               sticks.

               Closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into 
               the ice. There is a small patch of something dark and metallic 
               at the bottom.

               MacReady leans forward, intrigued.

               The men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various 
               points around the markings. MacReady squints and mumbles to 
               himself.

               The tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings. 
               No Norwegian in sight. An explosion kicks up the ice. A beat 
               as the ice sprays to the ground. Then the camera appears to 
               shake as the ground beneath it quivers.

               Another immense explosion follows. An earthquake-like force 
               throws the camera to the ground.

               The tape continues, distorted, unviewable. A distinct crack 
               in the lens. MacReady lets go of his companion and quickly 
               rewinds. The deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around 
               the room.

               Most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging. The new dog watches 
               them calmly, silently.

               He takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs 
               and sits upright. Completely still. He stares at them. A 
               beat. The dogs are aware of something. They begin to seem a 
               bit confused, uncomfortable.

               The new dog continues to stare. Sitting rigidly, unnaturally 
               still. His eyes dead, lusterless black spheres.

               Bewildered, a few dogs start to pace. As if sensing something:  
               a portent. A danger. But so odd. They begin a soft, purring 
               growl.

               The new dog remains a statue. The growling builds. More dogs 
               begin to pace. Nervously. Faster, encircling.

               Emitting hisses, snarls. The lack of response driving them 
               into a frenzy.

               Barks. Growls. More frenetic pacing. The din escalating. 
               Three dogs start to close in on the stranger.

               No response. MacReady nudges him. Clark rolls away, annoyed.

               MacReady pinches his snoring nose, cutting off the air.

               Clark sits up, groggy.

               Clark, sleepy, irritated, makes his way down the freezing 
               corridor. The wind soughing loudly overhead.

<b>               CLARK
</b>
               reaches the kennel door. The savage outpouring of noise from 
               within baffles and angers him. He unlatches the door.

</b>                         What's got into...

               Smack! Just as he opens the door, two dogs, as if jettisoned 
               from a cannon, knock him off his feet. Growls, barks, snarls. 
               And a screeching from within.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN

               MacReady is fetching himself a beer. The sound of the far-
               off screeching. He freezes. A beat. He turns and sprints.

<b>               HIS BEER CAN

               as it smashes the glass of the fire alarm. He pulls the lever.

<b>               INT. TUNNEL

               The alarm is blaring throughout the camp. MacReady, Garry, 
               Norris run through the narrow tunnel led by Clark.

               MacReady carries a shotgun. Garry, half-dressed, has his 
               .44. Clark, a fire ax.

               as the men approach the locked kennel door. The two dogs, 
               thrown into Clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door 
               trying to get back in. One is badly bloodied.

               The fight inside rages on. MacReady and Clark brace themselves 
               by the narrow door. Norris and Garry hold back the two 
               hysterical dogs. Clark undoes the latch and he and MacReady 
               enter the kennel.

               The light has been broken and it is pitch black. MacReady 
               snaps on his flashlight. Norris and Garry can't contain their 
               animals and the dogs burst into the room. They smash into 
               MacReady and send him sprawling. Total confusion: the dogs; 
               the men; the screeching; the blackness.

               MacReady gropes for his flashlight and rights himself. He 
               finds Clark. Then shines it around the cramped room trying 
               to get his bearings.

               The light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner.

               Barking mixed with hissing, a gurgling, a screeching.

               Dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray 
               with a vengeance.

               The flashlight illuminates parts of some "thing." A dog.

               But not quite. Impossible to tell. It struggles powerfully.  
               Garry pokes his head into the blackness.

               MacReady aims his shotgun at the entire pack.

</b>                         No! Wait!!

               Clark wades into the pack, grabs at dogs' hides and throws 
               them back. He then wields his ax into the fray, chopping and 
               hacking away at the gurgling, hissing silhouette.

               From out of nowhere, a large, bristly, arachnid-like leg 
               springs up and wraps around Clark's ax. It sends Clark 
               smashing violently into the wall.

               More men running, nearing the kennel. Several squeezing in

               MacReady fires several rounds. A dog is flung at him, knocking 
               him and his flashlight once more to the ground.

               Garry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction 
               of the hissing and screeching. A dog is hit. MacReady crawls

               screeching.

               Part of the kennel starts to burn.

               Childs moves closer, continuing his assault on the hissing,

               Men charge into the room and begin spraying dogs and burning

<b>               INT. REC ROOM - NEXT MORNING

               Those of the men that have gathered exhibit a pale and quiet 
               uneasiness.

               Blair, in silent awe, stands over the badly burned corpses 
               of two interlocking dogs, that lie before him on a table.

               They are connected as if they were one animal. Though, the 
               one wearing the remnants of Clark's bandage is much larger 
               and appears less dog-like. Its entire torso is cracked and 
               peeled, as if its innards were trying to burst out.

               Odd appendages, recoiled and withered by the flame, are 
               wrapped grotesquely about both bodies.

               Clark, his eyes set in glassy stare, sits in shock. Nauls 
               comforts him. Childs stands nearby smoking a joint and staring 
               at the floor.

               Blair, transfixed, continues hovering over the united 
               cadavers. Weighing. Thinking. A very worried look on his 
               face.

               The dead bodies of two other dogs from the kennel are not 
               far off.

               MacReady pilots. Young Palmer and Norris are with him.

               It is clear but the winds are troublesome. The ride is a

               of a sharp drop.

               Pull back to reveal -- the massive black hole about fifteen 
               feet beneath the ice. Charred, gnarled and mangled metal are 
               all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere.

               MacReady's and Norris' eyes meet each other in silence.

               MacReady finds a burst thermite canister. He and Norris climb 
               down.

               They move along amongst the wreck. Almost everything but the 
               skeletal superstructure has disintegrated into a fine ashy 
               powder.

               Norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage, 
               while MacReady browses through the center.

               Palmer continues to marvel, as he walks around the oval, 
               atop the ice.

               MacReady returns and kneels down next to Norris as the latter 
               examines a piece of metal.

               The night feeding. Clark dishes out the food. Blair is taking 
               blood samples from the remaining three dogs.

                         Clark, did you notice anything strange 
                         about that dog? Just anything at 
                         all? Any little thing?

</b>                         No. Just that he recovered real 
                         quick... That night when I found him 
                         in the rec room, he had already 
                         scraped off his bandage. Before I 
                         put him with the others, I redressed 
                         his wound and noticed it had healed 
                         up real good...

               A beat as Blair stares at Clark.

                         a bit. When I came back, he was gone.

               Clark seems uneasy under Blair's intense gaze.

               Blair stands, his eyes still glued to Clark.

               Irritated, distressed, station manager Garry moves briskly 
               down the hall. Blair, worried and pale, tries to keep up

               Far away from the others, MacReady sits in his little hovel 
               putting the final screw into his mended chess set.

               On the other side of the set, his busty, inflatable companion 
               has been propped up in a chair. His sombrero hangs down her 
               back, keeping her in place. Hawaiian music plays from his 
               tape deck.

               He puts down his screwdriver, holds up his glass and offers 
               a toast with a big grin.

               He clinks the drink he has made for her that rests on her 
               side of the board. He sips. He turns on the machine and makes 
               his first move.

               He flips open the circuitry panel in disgust. He tosses his 
               screwdriver on the board and grabs his drink, downing it.

               MacReady exits. He swacks at a nearby bank of ice with a

               The sound of a clanking. He turns his attention. Metal against 
               metal. Strange. MacReady listens. It appears to be coming 
               from far off below, near the camp.

               as he makes his way down with the aid of the steadying ropes. 
               The clanking louder now. He senses the direction.

               at the bottom near the main compound.  The sound has stopped.  
               He looks around in the near blackness.  A beat.

               sitting idle in the dark. MacReady approaches. The door to

               Sanchez lies on the floor, groaning. Blair holds the gun on

               A beat as MacReady takes this in. He pours the gas over the 
               remains and sets it aflame.

               Childs and Bennings are not that anxious to continue.

               MacReady gets on and revs up the engine.

               making its last pass, rolling off the horizon. Only a slight 
               orange hue left.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

<b>               THE SNOWMOBILES
</b>
               move slower, positioned on either side of the tracks. The 
               tracks abruptly change direction. The men come to a stop.

               It is much colder now. Their beards, a mask of white powder.

               MacReady surveys the new direction. They are headed toward a 
               far-off ridge of bluffs. Large, windswept mounds of ice.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               THE SNOWMOBILES
</b>
               as they move through a valley of newly-formed dunes and tall 
               ice cliffs. The last of the sun obscured, the headlamps are 
               turned on and pointed at the tracks.

               The men look behind, in front, and from side to side, as 
               they proceed cautiously through the maze. Up ahead MacReady 
               spots:

<b>               A DOG
</b>
               It sits, its back to them, unconcerned, heedless of their 
               arrival. It is munching on the other half of the dog carcass.

               The men stop their machines some twenty yards from it. They 
               are hemmed in at the valley's narrowest point.

               Childs, carrying the torch, and MacReady, armed with a 
               thermite bomb, wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal 
               in their snowshoes. Bennings stands back by the snowmobiles.

               Childs and MacReady spread out some dozen feet from the dog. 
               It continues to pay them no mind, content to chew its food.

<b>                                     CHILDS
</b>                         Where's the other one?

               Bennings surveys the tops of the snow bluffs that encircle 
               them with his flashlight.

<b>                                     MACREADY

                         Where's your buddy, boy? Huh?

               No response. MacReady searches the near vicinity with his 
               light. All three are growing uneasy.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't 
                         let up until he's ash.

               Childs turns on the gas and lights the tip.

               Bennings is still watching the bluffs. Something from beneath 
               the snow reaches up and grabs his feet. He is ripped back 
               down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion. 
               He screams, his head the only thing sticking out of the ice.

               Childs and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything 
               be Bennings' screaming head. They rush toward him.

               MacReady stumbles.

               The sound of a snapping, a crackling to MacReady's rear.

               He freezes; turns back to the dog. Its back is still to him; 
               its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine. It 
               snarls; its face turns slowly toward him.

               Its skin splitting; its mouth ripping open wildly.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Childs!!

               Childs stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices 
               the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward 
               MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible 
               jump of some twenty feet.

               Childs lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the 
               force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice 
               in flames.

               MacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and 
               engulfs the screeching animal in fire.

<b>               BENNINGS
</b>
               howling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. 
               Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what 
               has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help.

<b>                                     MACREADY

                         Stay back!!

               Bennings' head disappears with a sudden jerk through the 
               ice. The ice continues to rumble like boiling water, moving 
               in different directions. Part of Bennings' body pops up in a 
               different area and is just as quickly pulled back down.

               MacReady and Childs watch on in frustration and anger.

<b>                                     CHILDS

</b>                         How the fuck do I know?!

               Bennings' head and shoulders then surface near one of the 
               snowmobiles. Something has him. Unclear as to what. The jowls 
               of a dog. But huge. Bennings' heavy clothing begins to rip, 
               tear, as if his skin underneath was bulging out. The jowls 
               seem to be absorbing his head.

               MacReady runs for the snowmobile.

<b>                                     MACREADY

</b>                         He's gone already! Do it!

               Childs blasts away. The ice begins to melt as Bennings and 
               whatever has him catch fire. A screeching.

               MacReady grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles. Suddenly a 
               steel-like, arachnid-shaped arm shoots out in pain and with 
               incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the 
               snowmobile. MacReady is knocked back. He recovers and dumps 
               cans of gasoline on the writhing mess.

               He dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage.

               He and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in 
               flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. 
               The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them.

               They look to each other in disbelief, their faces illuminated 
               by the flickering flames. The strident sounds beginning to 
               subside.

               Garry breaks it up, pulling them apart. MacReady enters from 
               the outside. A bundle is tucked under his arm.

               A half dozen rarely used guns are inside. He tries the handle. 
               Locked.

               He hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are 
               nearing. He breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. Then a box 
               of shells. He frantically tries to load, but is too nervous.

               The others arrive at the end of the hallway. Garry pulls his

               Still trembling, he tosses the shells back into the broken 
               case, leans the gun against the wall and begins to sob.

               The generator has been repaired; the lights within the 
               compound are back on.

               Grim and tense. Everyone is present but Fuchs. Eyes flit 
               from man to man. Palmer, Nauls and Sanchez are spread out 
               about the room, keeping as much distance as possible from 
               the rest.

               Norris and Childs are tying the Doctor, Clark and Garry to 
               the couch. MacReady prepares several makeshift blowtorches 
               as he kneels on the ground.

                         Huh?

               No answer as the men's faces roam the room. Childs glares at 
               Garry as he begins to tie him in.

               Childs whales on him with a right hand. Both go tumbling 
               over the couch. MacReady and Norris dive in breaking it up.

               MacReady, furious, pulls Childs away.

               Norris breathing heavily from the activity, massages his 
               chest. The strong, stormy winds overhead batter the roofing. 
               MacReady glances up. He and Childs release each other.

               He tosses torches to Sanchez and Palmer.

               MacReady and Nauls, wearing their snowshoes and using flares 
               for light, pull themselves along the steadying rope that 
               leads to Blair's shed. They are careful to keep an eye on 
               each other as they move along.

               Sanchez heads off in the direction of another shack.

               move into the next corridor. Palmer falls a few steps behind.

               He moves to the other side of the wall, parallel with Childs. 
               They continue on, skimming along the sides of the corridor 
               in plain view of one another.

               Nauls and MacReady arrive at Blair's shack. They peer in 
               through the spaces between the boards.

               A weak light burns as Blair is seated eating out of a can. A 
               hangman's noose dangles from the ceiling nearby.

               The winds are thick and vicious now. MacReady and Nauls pull 
               themselves along the rope fighting their way up the slope. A 
               violent gust sends MacReady's body horizontal, but still 
               hanging onto the rope. The wind slaps him back down. His 
               flare and torch tumble back toward Nauls.

               Nauls saves the torch from rolling down the hill.

               MacReady, lying vulnerable, watches Nauls pull his way toward 
               him. He tenses. Nauls reaches him. A beat. He hands back his

               Underground, rickety corridor. Palmer stands by as Childs 
               undoes the many locks to the room that houses his plants.

               One by one. Palmer twists his head in every which direction. 
               Nervous.

               Childs pulls open the heavy door. A flush of snow and wind

               Palmer, his mouth agape with terror, screams and points to

               into his chest, pins his frozen body to the inside of the

               Crunch. The door gives. The men move in. Their blow torches 
               ready. They freeze.

               MacReady stands before them holding a lighted flare. His 
               hair and clothing are covered with snow; his cheeks and nose 
               blackened by frostbite. Tucked under his arm is an entire 
               box of dynamite. He holds the flare dangerously close to the 
               open box.

               They do. He follows them out into the hall.

               The men step backwards carefully.

               They heed, retreating further down the hall. MacReady glances 
               behind him.

               Nauls and Norris, who have silently crept in through the 
               supply window, come flying through the hacked-up door and 
               barrel into MacReady. Both going straight for the flare.

               MacReady spins Nauls off and rips into Norris, sending him 
               crashing violently into the wall. Nauls tackles MacReady's 
               legs, pulling him to the floor.

               The others rush him. MacReady, still in control of the 
               dynamite and flare, bellow:

               Norris, lying on the floor, coughs as if gasping for breath. 
               He quivers for a moment and then is still. Nauls crawls over 
               to him and shakes him. A beat.

               Norris' body is plopped on the examination table. Copper 
               stumbles and is steadied by some of the men. MacReady 
               continues to keep his distance.

               Copper places an oxygen mask over Norris' face. He then rips 
               open his shirt.

                         kill you on general principle, Nauls.

               Copper begins swathing Norris' chest with a gelatin substance.

               Sanchez pushes over the portable fibrillator. Copper climbs 
               up on the table and straddles Norris' chest.

               Unnoticed, Clark paws the contents of the instrument tray 
               behind his back.

               They do so. Copper holds electrical prongs over Norris' chest.

               Dr. Copper presses the prongs onto Norris' chest and shoots 
               a bolt of current. Norris' body heaves upward. A slight 
               crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask.

               Buzzz. Several more jolts from the prongs. Clark's hand has 
               found a scalpel. He gently lifts it out, bringing it to his 
               side.

</b>                         Damn you, MacReady!

               Norris' body begins bounding up. More crackling and popping. 
               His chest begins to break up and spread. The mask pops off -- 
               a hideous mewing escaping from Norris' distorted mouth.

               The men jump back, incredulous. Dr. Copper scrambles off his 
               chest and flops to the floor.

</b>                         God... what...?

               They watch on in stunned horror as The Thing that was Norris 
               begins to change, to spread awkwardly on the slab.

               Its clothes tearing. A shoe splits in half and falls to the 
               floor, exposing the beginnings of a talon.

               MacReady charges toward it, shooing the men off.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Get out of the way!!

               He unloads with a stream of flame. The body writhes in pain, 
               belching and hissing. The slab catches fire. It struggles, 
               lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet.

               A black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and 
               squirts to the floor. Norris' body collapses on the 
               fibrillating machine in flames. Extinguishers are ripped 
               from the walls and put to work.

               MacReady watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, 
               as they twitch and mew on the floor.

               Within seconds the fire is out. The men stand around in awe 
               as they look upon The Thing that was once Norris.

               MacReady continues to observe the small particles. Their 
               tiny squeals abating into silence.

<b>               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady, still carrying the industrial torch, has maneuvered 
               all the men into the room. He holds Garry's .44. He has 
               untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the 
               nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite.

               MacReady cocks his gun. Childs holds his ground.

               A beat. Clark springs for MacReady. Scalpel raised.

               MacReady spins and fires three shots, point-blank, the forces 
               of the charges sending Clark flying backwards. The others, 
               themselves about to pounce, stop -- as MacReady whirls the

               He stands nervously for a beat.

</b>                         Slide it back here.

               Copper pushes it toward MacReady.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Now step way back.

               Copper steps backward, moisture beginning to collect on his 
               brow. MacReady begins to heat the copper wire over the Bunsen 
               burner.

               The men watch intently. The wire begins to glow. MacReady 
               points the torch directly at the Doctor. Both of them 
               perspiring. MacReady lifts the glowing wire from the flame. 
               The Doctor is dead still. MacReady slowly touches the wire 
               to the Doctor's plate. A soft hiss.

               MacReady heats it again and tries once more. The same soft 
               hiss. MacReady and the Doctor both let out a sigh.

                         fibrillator on Norris if you were 
                         one of them.

               He hands Copper the torch.

               He cuts himself with the scalpel and begins collecting his 
               own blood.

                         know.

               He heats the wire and puts it to his plate. The same harmless 
               hissing. All eyes continue to watch as he tries again. The 
               same result. Childs mumbles.

               He heats the wire and lays it in Clark's dish. The hissing.

               MacReady glances over the group.

</b>                         Palmer now.

               He sets Palmer's plate in front of him and heats the wire.

                         You were the only one who could have 
                         gotten to that blood plasma...

                         ...we'll do you last...

               Screech!!! The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate.

               Palmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for 
               MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging 
               the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady 
               knocking him over the table.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Copper!!

               It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst 
               of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps 
               on the Doctor.

               The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings.

               MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to 
               the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously 
               at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him 
               skidding across the floor.

               Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he 
               positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his 
               forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head.

               The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his 
               feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body 
               of Dr. Copper.

               The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire 
               up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work.

               Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering 
               the thick steel instrument over his head.

               The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face.

               Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet 
               another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges 
               outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for 
               the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite.

               MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the 
               table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the 
               Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on 
               balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, 
               spitting and snarling as it continues to take form.

               MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. 
               Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the 
               ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering 
               Childs and Garry with his body.

               A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep 
               within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the 
               room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as 
               he can.

<b>               MACREADY
</b>
               perspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares 
               to continue the test. He heats the wire.

               The men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled.

               One of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes 
               his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. 
               Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes.

               MacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays 
               glued to the others.

               MacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have 
               torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears.

               The wire is dipped into the plate... Hisssss.

               Sanchez breaks down and sobs.

<b>               CHILDS

               sits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn.

</b>                         Let's do it, Bwana.

               Nauls and Sanchez take aim five yards away. Fierce, 
               determined. The wire comes off the flame into the plate... 
               the harmless hissing.

               The muscles in Childs' face melt into a sigh.

               snap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing 
               who he is sitting next to, squirms.

<b>                                     CHILDS

                         cut me loose, damn it!

               Nauls rips away his bindings. The other two stand guard.

               Childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor.

<b>               GARRY
</b>
               stares grimly ahead. Childs soaks his clothing with a can of 
               gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin 
               pumps, breathing halts.

               The burner. The torches. The wire. The plate. Garry's face.

               Hisssss.

               MacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches 
               are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor.

               Sanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his 
               face.

               A long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief.

<b>                                     GARRY
</b>                         I know you gentlemen have been through

                         I'd rather not spend the rest of the 
                         winter tied to this couch.

               A beat. Childs starts to giggle. The strain on MacReady's 
               jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at 
               Childs' uncontrollable laughter.

               The infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he 
               looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic 
               wind vibrating the roof. Nauls, untying Garry, grumbles, at 
               Childs.

               Childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady. His 
               smile fades, MacReady is now stone-faced. Childs' grin goes 
               stale, in sudden realization.

               The wind rumbles. The storm is at its peak. MacReady, Childs 
               and Nauls, guided by their flares, pull themselves along the 
               steadying rope, headed, for Blair's shack.

<b>               BLAIR'S SHACK
</b>
               The door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to 
               balance against the wind. They enter.

<b>               INT. BLAIR'S SHACK
</b>
               Empty. A few of the floorboards are loosened. They pull them 
               up. They stare down into a large hole beneath the planking. 
               Something is down there. They pull up more boards.

               The hole is some fifteen feet deep. Its dimensions are the 
               same as the shack. Its space is almost completely taken up 
               by some strange metallic object.

               Crudely fashioned, a patchwork job, but streamlined.

               Sheets of corrugated steel are visible; but cut apart and 
               welded into the desired shapes. The object appears to be 
               unfinished.

               MacReady pulls out a dozen tightly wrapped sticks of dynamite.

               Far off, amidst the howling gale -- the screeching. The men 
               jump. MacReady lights the fuse, as they make it to the exit. 
               He tosses it in.

<b>               EXT. COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE
</b>
               The explosion echoes behind them. The men pull along. Their 
               heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness.

               Some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, 
               severing the line. The wind sends the men tumbling along the 
               ice. Childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out 
               of sight.

               MacReady and Nauls have lost their torches. They pull 
               feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound.

               The screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his 
               grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building.

               He crawls along looking for an opening.

               Nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel.

               He climbs down through the open stairwell.

<b>               INT. PLANT ROOM

               MacReady has found the broken window. He rolls through it, 
               landing on the frozen plants below. Something smashes at the 
               glass above his head, trying to get in. He sprints for the 
               door. Fuchs' frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax. 
               MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob.

               He finally gets it open and lets himself out, slamming and 
               locking the door from the hall. Fuchs' body swings eerily, 
               back and forth.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady charges up the stairs from the plant room. He zooms 
               down the twisting corridors, opening and closing doors. He 
               rounds a bend and crashes into Nauls coming the other way.

               pouring gasoline into empty bottles, preparing Molotov 
               cocktails.

               Garry is connecting an electrical device: wires attached to 
               two portable generators. MacReady appears to be injecting 
               something into empty contact capsules. The men work 
               feverishly.

               Nauls rushes in with another box of dynamite.

               The wind belts into the roofing overhead. Garry sets the 
               wiring to the main doorway. MacReady begins blocking off one 
               of the other entrances with a large computer.

               MacReady rips linen, soaks the strips in gas, and stuffs 
               them in the Molotov bottles. Garry tests the current on the

               away, Sanchez maneuvers the refrigerator in front of another 
               outlet.

               Sanchez hears a quiet purring, bubbling sound. He turns to 
               Nauls.

               A blaring. They whip their attention to stereo speakers on 
               either side of the kitchen. Rock music screams out. Top 
               volume.

<b>               INT. REC ROOM
</b>
               The same loud music. MacReady and Garry look to the three 
               speakers attached to the walls. MacReady yells his 
               incomprehension to Garry. Garry tries to respond. Their voices 
               drowned out.

               Empty. Another of the stereo speakers that line the walls, 
               thunders.

               Nauls, in sudden realization, screams over the din and points

               MacReady, cursing, rips the speakers off the wall.

               The music is now subdued within the room, but continues 
               booming throughout the camp. Nauls' scream can be barely 
               heard.

<b>                                     GARRY

<b>               INT. KITCHEN - NAULS

               at the top of his lungs...

</b>                         MacReady! We been cut off!!

               A sharp, red, talon-like fingernail, pierces the top of the 
               door above Nauls' head. It saws downward, quickly.

               Black goo drips through the slit. The sawing obscured by the 
               music.

               Sanchez, eyes bulging, points. Nauls turns. A claw rips 
               through the wood. Nauls dives to the floor.

               In the opposite direction, behind Sanchez, another arm splits 
               through the door and the refrigerator, extends itself five 
               feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet.

               Sanchez struggles, looking imploringly at Nauls. He bites 
               down on his capsule. Nauls takes off like a speed skater.

<b>               INT. REC ROOM
</b>
               The sound of the screeching over the music.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Got to get to the generator.

               He opens the door. Looks down the hall. No one. The speakers -- 
               blaring music.

<b>               NAULS
</b>
               full speed down the maze. Left. Right. Totally reckless. He 
               hits a straightaway.

<b>               SANCHEZ'S BODY
</b>
               from out of nowhere, blasts through the hallway wall, directly 
               in Nauls' path. A thick arm pins the body to the other side. 
               Unable to stop, Nauls skids out of control, banging into the 
               sides of the wall, his cyanide capsule flying out of his 
               mouth.

               Whatever the rest of it is, it starts to crumble through the 
               wall. Nauls dives over the arm, somersaults to his feet and 
               takes off.

<b>               INT. MAIN HALL

               MacReady, running, spots Nauls careening out of a turn, 
               heading toward him.

               Nauls blazes by him. MacReady hears the snarls and screeches 
               heading his way. He streaks after Nauls.

               They make it in. Lock the door... MacReady tries to catch 
               his breath. Nauls shakes, pants.

               The loud music in the compound is turned off. MacReady shuts 
               off the lights. The men spread out. Silence.

               The sound of a door opening and closing. Far off.

               Another creaking door is opened. A rustling. Still far off. 
               MacReady and Nauls spread further apart.

               The soft bubbling, cooling sound. A slight scratch at the 
               door. Garry's hand tightens around the generator switches. 
               The scratching gets more pronounced. MacReady cautions Garry 
               with a whisper.

<b>                                     MACREADY

               The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady 
               light two cocktails each.

               The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling 
               quivers. The gas bombs are cocked.

               From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst.

               Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. 
               Nauls the same.

               For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous.

               Grotesque.

               Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals 
               from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its 
               body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door.

               Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still 
               another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the 
               switch.

               The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly.

               One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends 
               it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its 
               latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it 
               loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening.

               MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.

<b>               INT. COMPOUND - HALL

               The distant sound of a motor. Nauls, battered and bloodied, 
               his leg apparently broken, crawls along the ground. Another 
               sound, a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear. 
               But closing.

               The terror forces him to drag faster, oblivious to the pain.

               He reaches the bathroom stall. Crawls in. Locks it. The 
               gurgling nears. Leaning on the toilet seat, he looks about 
               himself, frantically.

               The Presence pauses at the door. A scratching. Nauls paws, 
               rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his 
               fingers as he tries to break it off the siding.

               A strong blow begins to breach the stall door. Nauls finally 
               unhinges the piece of wood, brings the jagged end to one 
               side of his throat and rips...

<b>               INT. LAB WALL
</b>
               The motorized rumbling nears. The wall seems to explode. The 
               tractor barrels into the lab. Its enormous shovel scooper 
               tearing half the room to shreds.

               MacReady drives. His eyes glint like a wild man's; he looks 
               stark raving mad.

               His frostbite, now in an advanced stage, resembles black war 
               paint. He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, 
               like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks 
               have been tied together at the top and are draped around his 
               neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN.

               They are used for the weather balloons.

               He pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his 
               mouth, grins and bellows.

                         little remodeling!

               MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary. 
               Medical equipment goes flying. The machine is powerful; the 
               prefabricated walls buckling under its force.

<b>               INT. COMPOUND

               A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend.

               Boom.

               MacReady rams into the mess hall, sweeping away tables, 
               chairs. He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song. 
               All the while he keeps his eyes on everything.

               Through the kitchen. The foundation is crumbling. He sings 
               on.

<b>               NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               Gurgling and hissing. A taloned arm slinks around a corner 
               in retreat.

</b>
               plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub 
               area. He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from 
               the bar.

                         fangs on your chest.

               He takes a drink and rams through another wall.

<b>               INT. REC ROOM
</b>
               The tractor blazes into the rec room. MacReady parks it 
               directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by The 
               Thing when it surprised them earlier.

</b>                         Damn it, ran out of gas.

               He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over 
               the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing 
               from roof, to doorways, to rubble.

               Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging 
               MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened 
               fingers.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty 
                         cold in here soon... You better make 
                         your move... I mean, hell, I'm only 
                         one person...

               He takes a swig from his bottle.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         I know you're bugged because we ruined 
                         your trip, right? Spiffy little toy 
                         you had there.

               A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through 
               the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in 
               his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         But your real hang up is your looks...

               A stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                              (wants him bad)
                         Atta boy. I know you're around.

               The floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around 
               the room.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Come on, sucker.

               The tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward 
               and looks straight down through the chassis and into the 
               vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting 
               the steering wheel but missing his face.

               He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet.

               He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. 
               The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of 
               the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls 
               himself through.

<b>               EXT. ROOF
</b>
               He lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs.

               Half of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up 
               through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs 
               outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like 
               acid into the fabric.

               An immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball 
               fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating 
               almost immediately.

               The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and 
               the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He 
               rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off 
               the insidious limb.

</b>
<b>               INT. CAMP
</b>
               A ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground.

               MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, 
               from his shoulders to the floor.

               He walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches 
               of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up.

</b>
<b>               INT. PUB AREA
</b>
               Mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of 
               the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled 
               considerably.

</b>
               lighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours 
               himself a drink.

               A puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame 
               and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs.

               White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face.

<b>                                     CHILDS
</b>                         Did you kill it?

               He looks as weak as MacReady. A beat.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         I think so.

<b>                                     CHILDS
</b>                         What do you mean "you think so?"

               Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Yeah. I got it.
                              (refers to Childs' 
                              condition)
                         Pretty mean frostbite.

               Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his 
               puffy white hand.

<b>                                     CHILDS
</b>                         It'll turn black again soon enough. 
                         Then I guess I'll be losing the whole 
                         thing...
                              (refers to feet)
                         ...Think my toes are already gone.

               MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits 
               down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several 
               decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other.

<b>                                     CHILDS
</b>                         So you're the only one who made it.

               MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Not the only one.

</b>                         The fire's got the temperature way 
                         up all over camp... won't last long 
                         though.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Neither will we.

<b>                                     CHILDS
</b>                         Maybe we should try and fix the 
                         radio... try and get some help.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         Maybe we shouldn't.

</b>                         Then we'll never make it.

               MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch 
               from under the table and places it beside him on top.

<b>                                     MACREADY

                         If you're worried about anything, 
                         let's take that blood test of yours.

<b>                                     MACREADY
</b>                         If we've got any surprises for each 
                         other -- we shouldn't be in any 
                         condition to do anything about it.
                              (beat)
                         You play chess?

               They regard each other for a moment. Childs painfully sits 
               down across from MacReady.

<b>                                     CHILDS
</b>                         I guess I'll be learning.

               MacReady grins and hands the bottle to Childs. Childs smiles 
               back and takes a healthy swig.

               The fires smolder on. Bright embers dance in the blackness -- 
               pushed by the soughing wind.
