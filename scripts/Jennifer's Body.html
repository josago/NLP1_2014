<b>          INT. LEECH LAKE WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI, 17, sits on her hospital bed in
          pajamas. She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted
          expression. As she stares out the window, she winds
          colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a
          "god's eye."
<b>          
</b>          Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot
<b>          SECURITY FENCE.
</b><b>          
</b>          Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered
          casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even
          creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."

</b>                    Every day, I get letters. I think
                    I get more letters than Santa
                    Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil
                    combined. I'm kind of the shit.
<b>          
</b>          RAYMUNDO, a counselor raps on the door and sticks his
          head in cautiously.

<b>          
</b>          Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional
          gym uniform. As she slips off her pajamas, we can see a
          series of puffy, slash-like SCARS on her body.

</b>                    Sometimes the letters are from
                    people who say they're praying for
                    me. They tell me everything will
                    be okay if I just accept Jesus
                    Christ into my heart. I say the
                    words, but nothing ever happens.
                    Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off
                    the cross.
<b>          
</b>          She glances sadly at a PHOTO OF A BOY on her dresser. She
          touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse.

                    starfuckers who saw my picture in
                    the paper and want to marry me or
                    something. They think they can

</b>          We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in
          from guys. They line the mirror, grinning at us. There's
          even a DICK SHOT tucked in there.

</b>          Needy picks up a paper cup of COLORFUL PILLS on her
          dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry-swallows
          them.

</b><b>          
</b>          Several badminton courts are set up in the gym. As an
          intense OPERATIC ARIA plays over the public address
          system, the FEMALE PATIENTS enthusiastically--almost
          violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks.
<b>          
</b>          The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. A
          TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket,
          clipping her partner in the leg. In the corner, one
          forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another
          hurls her racket against the wall again and again.
          Counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable
          their charges appear. In the background, a few sulking
          patients jump rope.

          bunny slippers.

</b>          The freshly showered PATIENTS assemble for breakfast.
          They grab trays and settle into noisy cliques. Needy
          selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line
          and sits down, alone.

                    to wear us out. Keep us sluggish
                    so there won't be an uprising.
                    Well, those J.V. tactics won't
                    work against me. I'm a kicker. K-I-
                    C-K-E-R. It even says so on my

<b>          
</b>          We briefly cut to Needy's chart, on some doctor's
          clipboard. We see her name: ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI and a
          few brief details about FIRST DEGREE MURDER and GRANDIOSE
          NOTIONS. Beneath that, we see a triple-highlighted
          warning in bright ink: KICKER.
          A NUTRITIONIST with a clipboard approaches Needy casually
          and eyes her breakfast plate.

                       Toastem can provide you with
                       sufficient energy for your day.

          been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy-- and
          collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. We see that the
          bone has SNAPPED.
          The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by
          staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish.
          Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone
          nutritionist. The glob nails her in the eye.

                    loose around the edges or

                    Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork.
                    Dead inside.
          Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES
          in the darkness. Grinning skulls. Faces drained of life,
          half eaten. Grimaces of terror.
          Suddenly, soft music   is piped into "the hole," ostensibly
          to calm the patients   in solitary. Needy shudders and
          recoils at the sound   of it. It's a CHEESY ROCK BALLAD
          that we'll soon hear   again...

          Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock
          of hair.
          Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH

          disappears.
          Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched
          below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if
          via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish,
          sploish, sploish.

          head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically
          in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster.
          Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES

          instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense.
          We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy
          shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer,
          straddling her and bearing down.

          second, sexual control...
          Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right

          Suddenly, THE GIRLS' BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE

          He WINKS at Jennifer.
          The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we
          heard in the COP CAR and the HOLE. Jennifer's eyes never
          leave Nikolai's. She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's
          arm. Even the locals look charmed.
          Suddenly, a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling
          next to the stage. Needy is the first to notice. As she
          watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses.

          blaze uncontrollably. People SCREAM and scatter. Someone
          ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the
          fire.
          Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas
          exchange glances. The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar
          aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons
          his kit. Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he
          watches from the stage...is he smiling?
          CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once,
          causing a stampede. A woman's clothes and hair CATCH FIRE
          and she falls to her knees. We see a BEAM fall from the
          roof, nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA.
          Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.

          Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the
          tiny BATHROOM. Choking on smoke, they climb onto the
          Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant SOFT SHOULDER
          sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the
          BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside,

          Utter silence. Then a dripping sound. Needy looks down

          looking black bile all over herself and Needy and
          staggers wildly down the hallway.
<b>          
</b>          The bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed
          school portrait of Needy. Needy screams and watches in
          horror as it slides down the wall.
          The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it,
          like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by
          itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the
          corners. It's truly revolting.
          Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her
          mouth.
          Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to
          jagged, insane laughter.
          Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her
          against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her.
          Jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against
          Needy's hair, her earlobe. Needy doesn't move a muscle.
          Jennifer's hand slides up Needy's ribcage. She presses
          her lips against Needy's carotid artery.
          We hear Needy's blood pumping, swishing.

                    And I felt her dying, on the

          She climbs into the car and starts the ignition,
          trembling and crying.

          hard left. The streets are all almost identical, lined by
          working-class homes.
          She turns on the radio. The song is, of course, "Through
          the Trees" by Soft Shoulder. She pounds the dashboard,
          hysterical.

          tree-lined street. Then, she sees something bright emerge
          from the shadows. Her eyes widen...
          It's JENNIFER, creeping toward the curb like an animal.
          She's pale in the moonlight. The entire lower half of her
          face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore.
          She flashes a huge, deranged, toothy SMILE at Needy.
<b>          
</b>          Needy screams and SWERVES. The car fishtails out of
          control and slides into a ditch.
          Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get
          out of the trench. She glances desperately out the side
          window. Jennifer is gone.
          Panting, Needy tries to accelerate again.

          at Needy through the cracking glass.
          Needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and
          manages to rear up out of the ditch. Jennifer's body
          tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the

          Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. She
          wraps her legs around Jennifer's neck and drags her under
          the water.
          Jennifer emerges. Needy grabs her by the hair and girly-
          slaps her furiously across the face. Then she spots the
          PEPPER SPRAY lying by the side of the pool. She grabs it
          and sprays it in Jennifer's eyes. Jennifer shrieks and
          vomits NASTY, SPINY GORE all over Needy and Chip.

          The station wagon pulls off. As it sputters off into the
          distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, SOFT

</b>                    What a song. Thought we'd play
                    that one in honor of Soft
                    Shoulder. They're playing in
                    Madison tonight. Should be a night
                    to remember...
          The DJ's voice fades out as the car vanishes into the
          horizon.
