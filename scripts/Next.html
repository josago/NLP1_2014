                    That's why I stay away from
                    roulette and craps. It only takes a
                    millionth of an ounce to change a
                    roll. Just placing a different bet
                    can throw things off.

                    I've got other rules, too. I don't
                    play against people, like at poker.
                    Only against the house.
<b>

</b>                              CRIS (v.o.)
                    And my goal isn't to win big. At
                    least not any more. The idea is to
                    go unnoticed so I can keep coming
                    back to the trough.

          herself at the MEGA-SLOT and starts feeding it dollars.

          few steps on, he takes the bottle of OLIVE OIL on the cart
          and pours some in front of one random closed door. Cris then
          shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty
          intersecting corridor. A Black Suit barrels into the empty
          intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it.
          Behind Cris, a door swings open; a Black Suit charges out;
          steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and
          falls on his ass.
<b>

          FOUR MORE BLACK SUITS. Big guys. They try to grab him. He
          evades their grasp almost magically and, like a Shaolin Monk,
          somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a
          pile on the floor. Cris darts around them into the...
<b>          
</b>          Lobby
<b>          
</b>          He co-opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery.
          Rolling it to the left, a Black Suit on that side doesn't see
          him - and moves on. Cris switches to the right side of the
          card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him.
<b>          
</b>          Abandoning the cart, Cris sets off across the lobby in a
          herky-jerky rhythm.
<b>          
</b>          He walks four quick steps without being seen. Then stops
          behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way. When
          Black Suit 1 looks on, Cris resumes his journey, cutting
          across the lobby at an acute angle. In this way, he avoids
          being seen by Black Suit 2. Cris now backs up three steps and
          avoids being seen by Black Suit 3.
<b>          
</b>          By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his
          hunters will be looking, Cris achieves something like
          invisibility.

          bend to pick up another sack of clothes. Cris walks right by
          them without being noticed -- and climbs into the truck. A
          moment later, the Laundry Guys pivot back around, toss sacks
          of clothes in after Cris, and slam the rear doors. They get

          They operate like skilled Special Forces commandos. One of
          them signals, fingers to eyes, that he has spotted Cris. Cris
          enters a clearing and continues straight into the trap! The

          one MP and causes another to miss his shot. The Leader sees
          the stag and scans around for Cris. CAMERA repositions to
          reveal that the stag now stands between Cris and the Leader.
          The Leader shoots the stag, killing him, but not before Cris
          dashes to cover in another stand of trees.

          opens the door, walks into a corridor, and strides forward,
          preternaturally calm.

          which different hypothetical scenarios play out, one at a
          time, several simultaneously, or layered in like the melodic
          themes in a round or fugue, creating the visual equivalent of
          harmony and counterpoint.
<b>          
</b>          Cris encounters Security Police searching for him. When they
          discover Cris, they aim their weapons at him. He checks the
          time. Snapback a few seconds. He hides before they arrive.
<b>

          Snapback. Hides in a different room. It's empty. Cris
          searches the room. Looks in the desk drawers. Puts things in
          his pockets. The door flies open. Security Police find him
          and shoot. Snapback.

<b>

          Cris Johnson's fade away.
<b>          
</b>          Cris 27 finds the surveillance room with Leo in charge. Cris

          him first. He is hit in the chest. Fade out.

          takes their guns, but gets killed by reinforcements.
<b>          
</b>          Cris 63 waits in a room and peers through a crack in the door
          as his POV FAST FORWARDS, and he charts the comings and
          goings of the search parties, until they discover him, at
          which point he snapsback and hides in a different room. He's
          hiding in many rooms simultaneously. Spying. Piecing together
          the schedule of the patrol in that corridor.

          Fighting. Winning. Losing. Dying.

</b>          He goes down a stairwell. One version of himself exits at a
          landing. A second iteration of himself continues to the next
          floor down. At that landing, two iterations of himself turn
          in different directions, left and right.

          her somewhere else.

<b>          
</b>          He is waiting in several locations, watching to see where the
          MP's will emerge with Liz. The MP's and Liz emerge from an
          elevator in one of the locations. The other Cris' fade out.
<b>          
</b>          Liz is ushered into a room and locked inside. Four guards
          depart. Two guards remain posted outside. They see Cris.

          directly under the room where Liz is being held.

                    It's a joke, but it's true. The
                    future changes every time you look
                    at it. Because you looked at it.
                    Cause once you see it, you're
                    different. And that changes
                    everything else.
