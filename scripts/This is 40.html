<b>INT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
PETE (39) and DEBBIE (39) are having fantastic sex in the
shower. Debbie moans loudly. Pete is strong and sure of
himself. In total control.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy!

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Oh my god. So incredible. Want to
          know a secret? I took a Viagra.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I took a Viagra. Those things
          totally work. This is awesome. Why
          don't I use this every day?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What? What did you do? Wait. Stop.

Debbie gets out of the shower. Pete follows.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What's the matter?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You just took a Viagra to have sex
          with me?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I thought it would make it better.
          It was better. It takes some of the
          pressure off.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Because you can't get hard without
          a Viagra? Is it because you don't
          think I'm sexy?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I thought you'd think it was fun
          for me to supersize it for once.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          That is the worst birthday present
          you could ever give someone.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I was just trying to go turbo for
          your birthday.

<b>                    PETE (CONT'D)
</b>          My hard-ons are still in analog.
          This shit's digital.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I don't want a turbo penis. I like
          your medium soft one.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Look, I can get it up. Just not
          that far up.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Where did you get this?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I got it from Barry.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What? You got it from Barry?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Why do you care? This is my dick
          we're talking about, not yours.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          We are young people. We don't need
          medication to have sex.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I only took it because it's your
          birthday. I thought you'd like it.
          Happy fucking fortieth birthday.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I am not forty! And I don't want to
          have a husband who has to take
          Viagra to get a hard-on.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I don't have to take it every time,
          but once in a while...

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick.


<b>TITLE UP - THIS IS 40
</b>

<b>INT. HALLWAY/SADIE'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Pete sneaks down the hallway. He kisses SADIE (13) as he
wakes her. She wants to be left alone.
<b>                                                            3.
</b>

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Your breath smells weird.

Pete breathes all over her as he talks.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Wake up, wake up. Time to get up.


<b>INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Pete lifts a sleeping CHARLOTTE (8) out of bed and walks her
downstairs. It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to
hold her like she is a baby.


<b>INT. BREAKFAST NOOK - MORNING
</b>
Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the
table and decorate the room with birthday balloons,
streamers, etc. Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts
into his mouth occasionally. The house is a bit more
cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up.


<b>INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette.

<b>                    PETE (O.C.)
</b>          We're ready!

She holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove. She
puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine
of hiding the smell of smoke. She puts some weird oil in her
hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes
her teeth. She sprays cologne and walks through it.


<b>INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
Pete and the kids hold a cake and sing "Happy Birthday" as
Debbie walks in. When they are done she blows out the candles
on the cake which says "Happy 38th Birthday."

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Make a wish!


<b>INT. KITCHEN, TV AREA - MORNING
</b>
The kids eat cereal. Sadie watches Lost on her iPad while
Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen.
<b>                                                4.
</b>

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          Can I watch Lost?

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          You can't handle Lost. It's too
          violent, and you won't understand.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          If I don't understand it, why can't
          I handle it?

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Because you're eight.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I can handle it. I've seen a shark
          eat a guy on Shark Week.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Shark Week is fake.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          No, it's not.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          All of it is reenactments.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I know but they--

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          That's scary! You shouldn't be
          allowed to watch that.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          --they show the reenactments but
          they actually happened.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          It's going to give you nightmares.

<b>                    CHARLOTTE
</b>          I can handle a nightmare. You're a
          nightmare every day for me.


<b>INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
Pete clears the breakfast dishes.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Hey. Don't eat that cupcake.
<b>                                                         5.
</b>

<b>                      PETE
</b>          What?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          The one you just put into the sink.
          I saw you were hiding that.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          This cupcake? You think I'm going
          to eat this cupcake?

<b>                      DEBBIE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I so don't want this cupcake. Look.

He turns on the faucet and pours water on the cupcake.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You're still going to eat it.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I'm going to eat this cupcake?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Just put it in the trash.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What would you like to do today?
          Your choice.

<b>                      DEBBIE
</b>          Anything?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah, anything.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Just hang out with you guys.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Don't you want to get a massage? Or
          do something fun? Forty's huge.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I'm turning thirty-eight.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Okay. Thirty-eight. We'll move on.
          Isn't it weird that our birthday is
          the same week and that we're going
          to have a party, and it's just for
          me?
<b>                                                         6.
</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No. I don't think it's weird at
          all. Because you're turning forty
          and I'm turning thirty-eight.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Come on. Do you really want to be
          one of those ladies who's just so
          insecure about their age and they
          lie and then they've got to
          remember.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You don't get it. You don't
          understand how it works. I don't
          want to shop at old lady stores. I
          don't want to go to J. Jill and
          Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft. I'm not
          ready yet. I need two more years.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That is so insane, it kind of makes
          sense.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What did you get me for my
          birthday?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I thought you said that we
          shouldn't get each other gifts this
          year?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What do you mean? You're supposed
          to get me a surprise gift. This is
          a big birthday. I'm turning forty!


<b>INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING

Charlotte plays the theme from The Office on her keyboard.

<b>INT. SADIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Sadie tears apart her closet looking for clothes.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          Mom! Why can't I get new clothes?!
          Nothing fits me!! God damn it!!

<b>INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
Debbie is in workout gear. Pete enters wearing a lycra outfit
with all sorts of logos on it. He is a complete bicycling
asshole.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I am going to work out. I'll be
          back in about an hour.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Hey, did your father call to wish
          you a happy birthday?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No. That's no surprise.

Debbie leaves. Pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the
sink and takes a bite.


<b>EXT. SANTA MONICA STAIRS - DAY
</b>
Debbie runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer
JASON. Her friend BARB trails behind.

<b>                     JASON
</b>          Come on.

<b>                     BARB
</b>          Coming.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          You've got to keep up with us,
          sweetheart. That's why your body
          looks like your body and her body
          looks like her body. Before, after.
          Before, after.

<b>                    BARB
</b>          You guys just go on without me. I'm
          just gonna... fuck.


<b>EXT. BRENTWOOD - MORNING
</b>
We see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San
Vicente. Pete's friend BARRY is part of the group.

<b>                     BARRY
</b>          Hey, thanks for letting me join
          this team.
<b>                                                            8.
</b>

<b>                    PETE
</b>          It's not really a team, it's just a
          bunch of guys who get together and
          ride.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>          I know, I know.

A car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting
him. Pete bangs on the back of the car.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Bike lane, asshole! It's always the
          guy in the fucking Infiniti.


<b>EXT. STREETS NEAR THE STAIRS - DAY
</b>
Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her
feet down. In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          So why on earth is Pete taking
          Viagra? What's going on?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I don't know. I think maybe he just
          isn't attracted to me anymore.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          That is ridiculous. If you were my
          girlfriend, I would not need a
          Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra
          pill. To try not to get a boner.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          But everyone gives you a boner.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          Don't sell yourself short like
          that. You give me a boner.
              (whispers)
          Barb doesn't give me a boner.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Maybe things are just getting
          stale. That's why maybe I work out
          really hard. Maybe he'll be able to
          get a boner again.

<b>                    BARB
</b>          Why do you need to have sex, Deb?
          Sex is the number one thing people
          fight about.

</b>You stop having sex, there will be

I have no sex, and I am the
happiest I've ever been.

</b>I knew it. I knew you were not

face. It's all puckered and pained.

<b>          BARB
</b>I'm enjoying our non-sex period,

<b>          JASON
</b>Don't you miss it?

<b>          BARB
</b>Well, I wouldn't know, because I
don't have any feeling down there
anymore. I have nerve damage from
my C-section so everything is just
kinda-

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>She's numb down there.

<b>          BARB
</b>I could sit down hard on a fire
hydrant, and I wouldn't even know
that I was sitting. I could get
stung by a hornet down there, and I
would not feel it. You could put
anything in there, and I would not
know what the object was. I used to
pee in a nice stream, and now it
just kind of goes like a shower
head.

<b>          JASON
</b>That is the saddest thing I've ever
heard.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I think you need a family. Don't
you want a family?

<b>          JASON
</b>No, I think I want to Clooney it.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Clooney it?
<b>                                               10.

</b>          Yup.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          He doesn't seem happy.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          Yeah, he is.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No. He's lonely.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          No, he's not.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          See, I think he has sad eyes.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          Aw, you sweet little thing. He's
          doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the
          next lady. I can do it too, watch.

Jason demonstrates.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I bet George Clooney is really
          lonely. Just him and his pig.

<b>                    JASON
</b>          You'd fuck him.

<b>                    DEBBIE

</b>          I mean that was idiotic. You have

<b>                    JODI

          just admired so much. The person
          that I thought, "My god, wouldn't
          it be incredible to work with" was
          Graham Parker. Tonight we have him.
          Solo. Because we couldn't afford to
          fly in The Rumour.

The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage.

Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The
song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial.

We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little
depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored.

Pete is with RONNIE and CAT, employees at his record label.
They are watching an electronic press kit cut together for
Graham Parker. There is a montage of him performing
throughout the years from the seventies to the present.

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>                    CAT
</b>          I'm contextualizing him as one of
          the great figures in rock history.
<b>                                      25.
</b>

<b>          RONNIE
</b>You can't show him in his prime in
`77 and then jump straight to him
as he is now. It's terrifying. You
have to reverse it. You've got to
show him as he is now very briefly,
and then show him in 1977. You have
to "Benjamin Button" it.

<b>          CAT
</b>I don't know what you're talking
about, okay? All rock stars are
older now. Steven Tyler, David
Bowie, Mick Jagger--

<b>          PETE
</b>Paul McCartney.

<b>          RONNIE
</b>Okay, stop it. Everybody you're
mentioning looks like an old woman
now. You're just mentioning a bunch
of Jessica Tandys. Keith Richards
gets away with it. But that's
because Keith Richards looked
seventy when he was forty, and now
that he's seventy, he looks sixty-
nine. He's regenerating.

<b>          CAT
</b>I like it. And I think Graham
Parker is sexy.

</b>Yes.

</b>          Look. It's a retro label. That's

</b>          We don't have the money to market a
          new band. We just need to make
          Graham seem relevant. Who is he
          talking to?

<b>                    CAT
</b>          Um, the Jewish Journal.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          The Jewish Journal?

<b>                    RONNIE
</b>          Apparently old Jews are the only
          ones who still buy hard copies of
          records. Because they don't like to
          download music. Because they don't
          know what downloading means.

</b>So, let's just choose to be happy.

</b>Yeah.

<b>          PETE
</b>No, I'm just processing it all.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Some of these I wrote for you. So,
we have to exercise every day.
Spend more time alone together. We
have to go to the therapist every
week.

</b>That's a little pricey.

</b>No stressing over tiny things.

</b>Yeah, that's good. You should do
that.

</b>Yeah, I think it would be good if
you could take care of your anger.

<b>          PETE
</b>Sorry.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Okay, and then no more holding on
to resentments. We have to just let
that go.

<b>          PETE
</b>So, you're saying that if we're
arguing and I apologize, you'll let
it go and not throw it back in my
face later?

<b>           DEBBIE
</b>Well, I don't do that, but I will
continue not to do that. What did
you write?

a lot.

</b>          The not letting him guilt trip you
          all the time, because that puts a
          lot of pressure on you, and the
          whole family feels it. He's a grown
          man, and he's not our

          okay?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Yeah. Maybe we just suck it up

          we have.

</b>          That's why we have to keep her.

We watch the footage and suddenly Desi's BOYFRIEND enters. He
walks behind the counter, and she sits on his lap. She
adjusts herself.

</b>          Look at this, she's making out with
          somebody.

down a little.

</b>          That might be like a dry hump.

</b>          That's too grainy to know for sure.
          Oh my god, this is the middle of

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What are you talking about? We had
          sex the other night. You have to
          give me a little credit for that.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It's not about credit. We need to
          have more passion. Like this.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          That's not passion.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          It looks like passion to me.

He farts again. It is longer.

Debbie hits Pete with a pillow.

</b>I do want to kill you.

</b>How would you do it?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I don't know... poison you. I'd
poison your cupcakes that you

just put enough in to slowly weaken
you.

</b>          What?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          A medical marijuana cookie. Ben

<b>                    PETE

          that guy fucks. I know I don't fuck
          like Prince. Prince can fuck. I
          fuck more like David Schwimmer.

Almost totally under the covers, they watch as a WAITER
brings in a room service cart full of food.

Pete does magic tricks for the waiter.

<b>                    PETE

Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna. They could not look

They pull up to their house, shut off the car and sit for a
beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Debbie sees Pete on the bed, his legs up in the air. He still
has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down.

He is trying to look at his back end. He is holding a mirror
and an iPhone.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I need you to look at something. In
          my butt.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          Why?

<b>                     PETE
</b>          I think I've got something in
          there, and I'm not limber enough to
          see. I need you to look at it. I
          might have like an anal fissure or
          a hemorrhoid or a worm or
          something.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Trying to take pictures of it, so I
          can compare it to something on

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Can we just keep like a small shred

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Look, I saw you have two babies,

          all up in that.

a very quick glance inside.

Debbie walks over to Desi.

Desi begins to take all her clothes off in front of Debbie.

<b>                    DESI (CONT'D)
</b>          You know, I actually made this one

</b>          Did you?

<b>                    DESI
</b>          Yeah. I did the tiger on a piece of
          paper separately, and then I
          transferred it to the t-shirt.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Wow. So you stenciled on the tiger?

<b>                    DESI
</b>          I drew it on a piece of paper, and

          look amazing. My kids just sucked
          the meat right out of mine.

<b>                    DESI
</b>          No. There's some meat in there.

<b>                    DEBBIE

Pete talks is in his office on the phone with his REALTOR.

</b>          We expected more. I mean, I know

<b>                    REALTOR (O.C.)
</b>          I know, but based on the market,
          it's like you're gaining money.

          from Iran and they don't really

</b>          I think about that gray-haired
          pregnant lady from school and I
          just feel bad for her. And I feel
          bad for the kid. Can you imagine?
          All the other little kids, "Where's
          your mommy?" "Oh, she's the one
          sitting in that scooter eating a
          soft cracker." Kids don't want to
          have old parents. You know, it
          would also be nice for us to spend
          some time apart. Kind of rediscover
          who we are individually. It would
          be so great to not see you for like
          a chunk of time so that I could
          really just miss you. Remember when
          we used to miss each other?

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Well, it was you, I saw your

          and not put Sadie on the "Hot"

She gets even quieter, scarier and more in his face.

<b>                    DEBBIE

          Petty. How's that feel? Huh? You
          think that haircut's cool? It's
          not. It looks like you put your
          Justin Bieber wig on backwards. You
          still comfortable with yourself?
          Why are you wearing a tank top?
          Huh? So you can show off your bald
          pits, you little hairless wonder?
          Cool tank top, man. So next time
          you think about writing something
          nasty on my daughter's Facebook
          page, just remember me. Remember
          me. I will come down here, and I

          She cursed at him. He's thirteen

<b>INT. VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

</b>          We're going to work through it, but
          Debbie told my son that he looked
          like Tom Petty, in a negative way--

<b>                    PETE
</b>          Who's Tom Petty?

<b>                    CATHERINE
</b>          You know who Tom Petty is. And she

          that she was going to "F up his

</b>          He said it. To me.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What I said was that we need to

          advances, they need to learn to use
          them responsibly.

Desi is gracefully swimming under water. She looks gorgeous.
She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look
grotesque, red-faced and awkward. They both reach for each
other and come to the surface.

</b>Seven years? That's a joke, right?
That's like two Olympics. And I'm

know him. And I turned out
perfectly fine without his input.

Pete exits his home riding his bike. He is very angry. He
rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the
frustration out of his body.

Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard.

Pete rides down the street. A CAR passes by him. When it does
a fifteen-year-old TEENAGER sticks his head out the window
and yells to scare Pete.

Pete flies down a steep hill going crazy fast. Close up of
his front wheel shaking. It is as if he wants to crash.

He rides down the street when suddenly a MAN IN A RANGE ROVER
opens his door to exit his car and Pete slams directly into
the man's car door -- hard, breaking the man's window and
falling to the ground.

</b>          It wasn't a good party.

A NURSE walks over to them.

<b>                    NURSE
</b>          Hi. I'll bring you in as soon as
          his x-rays are finished.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Is he okay?

<b>                    NURSE
</b>          Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's
          been crying a little bit, but he'll
          be fine.

The Nurse walks away.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          You know Pete was never a real
          fighter. But that's why he married
          you. That's why he loves you.
          Because you're the fighter, and you
          need that. One person in a
          relationship has got to punch.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Do you mean that in a good way?

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Oh, it's a high compliment.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Thanks.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          Listen, I know what you're worried
          about. You think he's going to turn
          into me, but I don't think it's
          going to happen. He's smarter and
          probably a little cuter. A little
          less Jewy. Although, after fifty,
          that's all going to change. Be
          prepared to wake up one day with a
          a rabbi. But the good news is,
          he'll love you forever. That's in
          our DNA. We stick around.

</b>

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          He worries about you. It puts a lot
          of pressure on him.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I know. I just don't have anyone
          else to talk to about it.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          You can talk to Claire.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          No. If I open up to her she'll
          leave me.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          No, she won't, Larry, she loves
          you.

<b>                     LARRY
</b>          I know, but there's a certain point
          at which you just can't stay.
              (beat)
          I guess it's hard to forgive
          somebody if they don't formally
          apologize to you.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Are you apologizing?

<b>                     LARRY
</b>          I'm very close.
              (beat)
          Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad
          everybody's okay.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          Thanks.

She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit.

<b>                     LARRY
</b>          I'm off.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          Okay.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          This is awkward.

<b>                     DEBBIE
</b>          What?
<b>                                                       142.
</b>

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          I need forty dollars for a cab.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>              (laughing)
          That's funny.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          No, I'm not kidding. You drove me.
          I wasn't prepared.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I only have a hundred.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          That's okay. I'll bring you the
          change.

He grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off.

<b>                    LARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          All right, give him a kiss for me.


<b>INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Oliver is sitting on the couch with Charlotte and Sadie
watching the last scene of Lost. Joseph has joined them.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          I don't get it.

<b>                    SADIE
</b>          See, it's not sad, it's happy
          because they helped each other

<b>INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Debbie walks into Pete's room, sits on the bed next to him.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          I really liked our lives so much
          better before we tried to change
          everything. I'm sorry.
<b>                                      143.
</b>

<b>          PETE
</b>No. I'm sorry. I don't want to keep
anything from you. I love you.
You're my wife. I just didn't want
to let you down.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Are you mad that I'm pregnant?

<b>          PETE
</b>No. I'm not mad. I'm thrilled.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>You don't feel trapped?

<b>          PETE
</b>Sometimes I feel like I trapped
you.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I don't feel trapped.

<b>          PETE
</b>Really?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>No.

<b>          PETE
</b>You should, because I've trapped
you. You can't go anywhere. I'm
going to get you pregnant every ten
years for the rest of your life.
You can never leave me. Ever.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I never feel trapped by you. I'm so
happy to be with you. I love you so
much. You're my favorite person in
the whole world. god damn it, why
am I crying like this? Something is
wrong with me.

<b>          PETE
</b>You're pregnant.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Oh, yeah. Shit. I was just outside
telling your dad that I liked him.
What if he thinks I like him now?

<b>          PETE
</b>No, he won't think that.
<b>                                      144.
</b>

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>I don't want him to think I like
him that much.

<b>          PETE
</b>It'll never happen.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>    (suddenly giddy)
Can you believe it? This is the
craziest thing ever. What are we
going to do with a third baby?

<b>           PETE
</b>I have no idea. How are we going to
afford it?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>We'll sell the house.

<b>          PETE
</b>We don't have to.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>We kind of do.

<b>          PETE
</b>We kind of do.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>We'll make new memories in a new
house.

<b>          PETE
</b>I love you.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Is there anything you want to do
for your birthday? It's been the
worst birthday ever.

<b>          PETE
</b>There is one thing, but I don't
think you'll like it.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>What?

<b>          PETE
</b>I wouldn't mind going to see some
music. Would you want to do that?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>Yeah.
<b>                                                       145.

<b>                    PETE

          you're sweet for saying that.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          How do we break you out of here?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          I can just leave on my own
          volition. It's not a mental
          institution.

<b>                       DEBBIE
</b>          Can you?

<b>                    PETE
</b>          It's not like One Flew Over the
          Cuckoo's Nest. Please don't put a
          pillow over my face.

Debbie laughs.

<b>                    DEBBIE
</b>          Let's get out of here, McMurphy.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          You got it, Chief. Will you carry
          me?

As Debbie helps Pete off of the hospital bed, Pete kisses her
passionately.


<b>INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Pete and Debbie watch Ryan Adams perform "Lucky Now" with his
