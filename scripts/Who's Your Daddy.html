               We fly high above heavenly clouds.  Beneath a brilliant blue
               sky.  A TEENAGED BOY'S VOICE greets us...

</b>                         On any given day, your life can
                         change in the blink of an eye. 
                         It's a cliché, I know...

               Descending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in
               a dreamy gauze.  We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a
               small town.  Descending lower.  And lower.  To Xenia, Ohio.

                         clichés because they're true. Your
                         life CAN change in the blink of an
                         eye.  What I mean is, one day
                         you're a regular chump, a wannabe
                         something.  You're not even totally
                         sure WHAT you wannabe...

               We pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle
               America. Red brick buildings with names like "Miller & Son
               Drugs," "Two Sisters Gifts," "Nelson Family Market."   You
               can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber.

                         and some stranger's holding your
                         ticket to being SOMEBODY. 

               Still flying over the town, we focus on a TEENAGED BOY on a
               Schwinn.  We follow as he pedals his way to...

                         witted chain-smoking hillbillies
                         you see on TV.  You know, the ones
                         who win the Super Lotto and spend
                         their fortune on a truck full of
                         Goobers and a new set of front
                         teeth.  It could happen to any guy,

               A JANITOR raises the American flag.  It flaps proudly as the
               teenager chains his bike to a bike rack.
               He glances up at the flag, which is reflected in his uber-hip
               sunglasses.  When he smiles, in SLOW MO, his teeth seem to
               sparkle.

               We SWISH PAN to another teenager, locking his bike.  Meet our
               much less glamorous hero:  TED NELSON, 17.  A decent looking
               kid.  Not hip enough to be cool.  Not square enough to be
               tormented. He joins the other KIDS heading into the school.

               CHRISTY MALONE, 17, fills her cheerleader uniform in all the
               right places. We watch her at her locker. Also in SLOW MO.
               Which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful. Wow,
               just look at her stack those books.

                         of my loins.  

               Christy glances off screen and SQUEALS excitedly.  Another
               cheerleader enters the frame, holding a newspaper called
               "EXPOSED!"  Christy reads the headline.

               She shows him "Exposed!" Ted gawks. Happy just to be this
               close to Christy. But they are quickly interrupted by...

               PRINCIPAL RICHARD MERKIN, mid-50's, marches down the hallway,
               seizing copies of "EXPOSED!" from students' hands. We can see
               that it is a "homemade" looking newspaper. And there's
               obviously much ado about it.  Christy winks at Ted as she
               hides the newspaper in her locker.

                         That's no platonic wink. That's a
                         wink that says, "I don't just want
                         you, Ted. I NEED you." So of course
                         I had to ask her to the prom. I
                         mean, she was practically begging

               Ted ambles toward Christy. Struggling for nonchalance.  She
               limbers up by stretching her leg high against the wall. She
               whispers to another CHEERLEADER.  They giggle.  Then Christy
               turns to Ted.  Flashing that perfect smile of hers.

               The shrill ringing of a TORNADO DRILL ALARM snaps Ted out of

               Ted seems unaware that all eyes are upon him.  The cacophony

               POP! The cork flies through the air.  Bounces off the

               Champagne overflows from the bottle.  All over Charlie's

               People stare at him. A beautiful BLONDE smiles and waves. He
               waves back, very timidly.

               Charlie sticks his head out, too. Sun on their faces. Wind in

               Zukerman presses a remote control.  A wall panel slides open

               A devastatingly PERFECT WOMAN, GINGER, "Miss April,"  emerges
               from the pool, wearing nothing but a g-string. Her skin
               shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights. Rivulets of
               water stream down her body.  She reaches for a towel and pats
               her body dry. An incredible aura seems to surround her. 
               Separating her from the other spectacular beauties we've seen
               already.

               Ted looks at the walls again. Carefully. He has a knack for

               Ted looks at the impressive collection of suits. Runs his
               hands along the fabrics. Picks a particularly stylish jacket
               and tries it on. It fits poorly. Too big in the chest and
               shoulders. Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror.
               He's not half the man his father was.

               Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door. Ted quickly takes off
               his father's jacket and puts on his own. He lets Uncle Billy
               in.  LOUD PARTY SOUNDS momentarily pour into the room.

                         to explore the world. Not just a

               The Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi. They say
               their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes. When he opens them,
               Ginger stands at the edge of the tub.

               Ted can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets
               it fall to her feet.  The silhouette of her nude body is
               startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she
               descends, step by step, into the frothy water.

               Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper. 
               A wash of foam caresses her breasts.  She continues.  Until
               she's completely submerged.

               Ted looks startled.  The "Jaws" theme echoes through his
               ears.  He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels
               something.  Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him.

               He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's
               sucked under.  He thrashes.  His hand grabs the edge of the
               Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out.  And he slides under. Only
               to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips.
               Kissing him passionately.

               A beautiful spring morning.  Cars pull into the school
               parking lot.  Students mingle in small groups. Making their
               way into the building.  A group of GUYS look up.

               Suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the
               school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a
               grassy knoll. The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a
               pattern of white billowy clouds.

               The door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking
               seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his
               stylish Persol shades.  Until he takes a second step and
               stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first
               into the grass.

               Charlie is right behind him. Looking great, too, but vaguely
               Mafioso in his efforts to be hip. He turns to the beautiful

               Principal Merkin places the dog on the ground, takes a seat,
               and bites into a breakfast sausage.  He opens the paper and
               is confronted by a full page ad.

               Mrs. Merkin attempts the Heimlich Maneuver. Rather ineptly.

                         your chores.

               Ted takes the list.  Gives it a cursory glance. Nods to his

                         I had this idea of shooting on

                         at some famous Xenia landmarks.

               Ted laughs. Completely ignoring his dad. Who backs out of the
               room. Unnoticed. Neglected. Hurt.

</b>
               Mom drives up to the house.  She stares, aghast.

               There are tall, beautiful, ANGELS everywhere.  One cuts the
               grass.  Another pulls weeds. Two others on the roof, cleaning
               gutters.
               Still others wash the car...with Jimmy handling the water
               hose. Drenching the women, more than the car. Shrieks and
               giggles all around. Neighbors gawk.

               Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his
               wife. She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his
               arm.

               Ted stands on an ottoman as a TAILOR fits him for a prom

               Principal Merkin watches on the sidelines.  Surprisingly
               calm. Suspiciously happy.

               Ted caresses Ginger's bare back as they dance together. His
               head nestled against her breasts. Not a care in the world. 
               He spots Charlie on the dance floor. Making out with one of
               his dates, the IDENTICAL TAYLOR TRIPLETS, while the other two
               patiently wait their turn.

               WE notice Christy Malone dancing with her FOOTBALL CAPTAIN

               disappointed, longing gaze. But he's oblivious.

               Julie flashes the camera again. Capturing Ginger's panicked
               expression. We notice that Julie looks alluring in a deep
               purple strapless gown. Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far
               more appealing and natural.

               Kids dance, play drinking games, Spin the Bottle, and
               generally trash the place.

               The pizza delivery guy wheels a dolly with a huge stack of
               pizzas into the party, only to be attacked by the prom-goers
               like starving beasts. Grabbing the pizzas.  Devouring them

               the scene.  Men of all ages are milling around, gawking,
               focusing their long lenses.  Women are conspicuously absent. 
               Except for the gaggle of hardcore FEMINISTS with their
               placards, denouncing "Heaven."

               One Feminist approaches the Mayor.

                         not to some pornographer.

</b>                         The library also belongs to the
                         city.  And guess what?  It's going
                         to have a new Ted Nelson wing with 
                         three thousand children's books.

               The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops
               overhead, drowning out her words. The helicopter rises to the
               level of the photo shoot where the door slides open.  And
               just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core
               fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin
               frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.

               Molly flashes him. Principal Merkin averts his eyes.  Missing
               the sight of Molly's dress being blown off her body by the
               chopper's prop wash.  The spectators below APPLAUD.  They

                         you've got.  For Merk.

               Molly gets the idea.  She poses provocatively towards
               Principal Merkin, who suddenly realizes he's in a
               compromising position.

               But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him.

               Ted pulls out his camera and fires away. Blinded by the stage

               clothes are drenched, but they couldn't care less. In no time

               Christy slips off her cheerleader top. Lowers her skirt.
               Flings it aside. She's wearing only panties the size of a
               Band-aid. Ted is mute. Staring at her perfect body.

               Ted steps out of the shower.  Out of Christy's sight, he
               squirms in his jeans. Trying to hide his enthusiasm.

               MUSIC suddenly seems to come from nowhere. Nine Inch Nails.

               Ted looks through the lens. We can see him trembling.  Music
               blasts as Ted's camera burns through film.  They're both
               getting into it.  Water pulsating over her body. Steam
               rising.  Christy begins lathering her breasts.

               Is he hungry. He's been working up this appetite for ten

               Ted calls her bluff. He sets aside his camera. Walks right
               into the water. Through the steam.  Toward Christy. She wraps
               a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more.

               He turns away, but Christy presses her bare body against his

               shower drenches them.

               Suddenly, they roll into a pair of legs.  Both look up.  The

               Julie darts into the girls' restroom.  Ted stops at the door.

                         a stupid crush on her since I was
                         seven, but I never got closer to
                         her than four feet and then there
                         she was right in front of me,
                         completely naked.

               Julie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her
               summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's
               completely naked and absolutely gorgeous.

               Ted gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but
               this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares
               about.

                         to do with love. You can be around

               She puts on her dress, gracefully. As if nothing happened.

                         right thing. But that doesn't mean
                         they didn't watch you and miss you,
                         from afar.

                         thing ever invented.
                         It was like a little taste of

                         stores couldn't keep them in stock,
                         they were so popular. And even

                         pears, plums, and pineapples have

               tears. She flips ahead to "The Girls of Xenia" pictorial,
               only to find--

               Principal Merkin. Singing his heart out, in drag as Barbra
               Streisand. It's a series of shots from the Cincinnati
               nightclub. Other shots suggestively include him with Molly in
               the foreground, as if they posed together.

               Principal Merkin drives. The RADIO plays in the b.g. As one
               song ends, we hear the DJ say...

               The voice of Barbra Streisand fills the car.

               Principal Merkin pales.  He turns off the radio.  But
               somehow, he can still hear the song.  As he pulls into the
               school parking lot, students wave enthusiastically.  He waves
               back tentatively.  Anxiety rising.

<b>               EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

               Principal Merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by
               the sound of Barbra singing her heart out through the parking
               lot. Every student's car stereo blasts the song. Students
               CHEER. Chanting:  "BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA!"  Principal
               Merkin turns crimson.

               Graduation caps fall all around. People hugging, laughing,
