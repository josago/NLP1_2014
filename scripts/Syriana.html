          Exile is not a material thing, it is a spiritual thing,
          all corners of the earth exactly the same. And anywhere
          one can dream is good, providing the place is obscure,
          and the horizon vast.

          The minarets of Shi'a mosques dot the skyline. The sun
          rises through the smog. Keening SIRENS call the faithful.
          A GROUP of bearded, turbanned MEN in white robes carrying
          Korans walk down an empty street.

          As the religious men pass a nondescript metal door, a
          THUMPING SOUND rises...

          The door cracks open and THREE MUSLIM WOMEN in full black
          sack emerge. The door shuts quickly behind them.
          Stay with the THREE MUSLIM WOMEN as they walk away. CLICK

</b>
          Down two flights of crowded stairs, there's a bar, dance
          floor, low couches, minimal lighting, wasted PEOPLE.
          Wealthy young IRANIANS sit at a table littered with ice-
          buckets and bottles of Absolut and Johnnie Walker.
          And with them is BOB BAER, 40's, professionally
          nondescript, he could be anything, a salesman, a high-
          school teacher. His face is ever-changing and his eyes
          miss nothing. Bob is the only American in the place and
          still you almost wouldn't notice him.

          ARASH AMIRI, 20's, a confident young Iranian, yells over
          the music. Beside him is his BROTHER.

<b>          4 EXT. TEHRAN STREET - DAY 4
</b>
          The trunk SLAMS. Bob carries a worn ATTACHE CASE. The
          Amiris get out of their car, oblivious Shiite party boys.
          Bob walks, happy. Dour MEN at cafe tables miss nothing.

<b>          5 INT. KEBAB SHOP - DAY 5
</b>
          Corrugated metal shutters CLOSE, sealing out the light.
          Arash ushers Bob through the gloom toward TWO MILITARY
          CASES. Bob expertly flips one over and opens it.
          Inside: A STINGER MISSILE, neatly disassembled. He finds
          the serial number: 3j16w4921.
          A SMILEY FACE is scratched into the metal of the Stinger.
          Bob tries to activate the Stinger. It's dead. Arash and
          his brother perspire. Bob is perspiring.
          Bob thinks he hears faint MOUTH BREATHING from behind the
          curtain closing off the rear of the shop.
          Bob opens HIS ATTACHE CASE. He removes a pouch. The pouch
          holds a battery. The battery has a serial number.
          Bob finds: 3j16w4921. A perfect match. He removes the
          dead battery and replaces it with the live battery. He
          activates the missile. It works. Everyone is relieved.

          battery and activates the second missile.
          Arash and his brother share a celebratory glance. Arash
          suddenly takes ONE CASE and drags it through the curtain.
          Bob hears LOW VOICES. He turns questioningly to Arash's
          brother who just stares and smiles like an idiot.
          Then Arash reappears, passing by Bob.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          You said they were both for you.
          Arash tosses an envelope at Bob --

<b>                         ARASH AMIRI
</b>          What do you care?
          Bob glances in the envelope. Behind him, the Amiris are
          picking up the other case. Bob moves toward the curtain.
          IN THE BACK OF THE SHOP Bob's eyes adjust. Several robed
          shapes, ghosts in grey light, carry the case out a door.
          The BARREL OF A GUN touches the side of Bob's head. The
          SOUND of a SHELL CHAMBERED and a MOUTH BREATHER.
          Bob raises his hands. The barrel slides around to his
          forehead and Bob is staring into the blue eyes of
          MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA, 40's, bearded, and calm.

          Behind Bob, in the distance, the Amiris get into the car.
          Bob glances up at the roof and NODS ONCE, continuing to
          walk toward camera as --

          Tight on the game of Asteroids. The version from the

          shooting white dots at drifting "rocks," breaking them
          up, only to create more rocks.
          A hand rapidly hits the firing button. ROBBY BAER, 16,
          concentrates, hits hyper space, smiles, remembers he has
          a retainer, hides his smile.
          He glances over at a cafe table where Bob and MARGARET
          BAER, 40's, frank and guarded in a way that is
          compelling, are having morning coffee. We realize that
          all around them are IRANIANS, that a crowd is massing in
          the street outside, and that Bob clearly doesn't want to
          have this conversation.

          cultural ally of the U.S. The

          the clock to the 8th century. I
          see students marching in the

          Number three sound good to you?
          He lets go of the generator and picks up an evil-looking

          playing, keep buying your toys,
          keep spending fifty thousand
          dollars a night for your hotel
          room, but don't invest in your
          infrastructure, don't build a real
          economy, so when you finally wake

</b>          I studied at Oxford. I have a PHD
          from Georgetown. I want to create
          a parliament. I want to give women
          the right to vote. I want an
          independent Judiciary. I want, to
          start a new petroleum exchange in
          the Middle-east and cut the
          speculators out of the business.
          why are the major oil exchanges in
          New York and London anyway? I'll
          put all of our energy up for
          competitive bidding, I'll pipe
          through Iran to Europe like you
          proposed, I'll ship to China,
          anything that achieves efficiency
          and maximizes profits for my
          people, profits which I'll then
          use to rebuild my country.

          and family are completely incinerated. And nearby Bob's
          car is a massive ball of flame.

          Wasim who is watching the tanker where workers and
          touring dignitaries pay no attention.
          On another boat a father and son fishermen going about
          their business. The father smiles briefly at Wasim.
          Wasim sees that Farooq is frozen. Wasim shouts at him in
          Urdu. Farooq hesitates a moment longer, then his hand
          pushes the throttle forward.
          The dhow accelerates, breaking free of the flotilla,
          heading straight for the CONDOLEEZA RICE (LNG CARRIER).
          At the bowsprit, Wasim has the wind and sunlight and
          spray in his face.

          covering of frozen, sparkling condensate and look exactly
          like SNOW COVERED MOUNTAINS.
          On Wasim's face a slow, almost beatific smile begins to
          spread. He seems completely at peace as he passes into
          the shadow of the tanker.
          On the CONDOLEEZA RICE sailors become alarmed, running in
          different directions, but it's too late
          The little boat speeds for the side of the tanker and
          just as it makes impact --
