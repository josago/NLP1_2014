The Woodward Forensic Institute (WFI) is a 175-bed Intermediate
Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric
patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories
of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the
Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State
or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian.

<b>OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS:

<b>INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN
</b>



PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM
CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second
before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a
glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it.
Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs
(wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30,
sharp and prettier than she knows.




<b>INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING
</b>
Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on,
goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the
water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something
slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A
person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the
perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like
graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She
emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself
in a towel.




<b>INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING
</b>
Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.




<b>INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial
analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast.
Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case
file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the
newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.




<b>EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING
</b>
Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps.
Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers.
Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives
off.




<b>EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR
</b>
Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets
her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the
wall:

The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as
we...







<b>INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING
</b>
Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the
according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces
a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic,
deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session:

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             This is your stepfather who came
             to visit you?

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             My stepfather?  No.   He's dead.
                     (beat)
             I killed him.
Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough.
Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             That's the first time you admit
             it.

<b>                          CHLOE
</b>
             So? There's a first time for
             everything.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
                     (jotting this down)
             It means you're finally past the
             denial stage. This is good,
             Chloe.

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             I never killed anyone who didn't
             deserve it.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             You only killed your stepfather as
             far as I know.

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             I should've taken care of my
             mother. She knew all along.    You
             remind me of her.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             I remind you of your mother?

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             Always so put together. Like you
             iron your underwear. Like your
             pussy is the apricot of the
             Promised Land and the bread of
             the --

<b>                           MIRANDA

                     (getting her back
                     on track)
             Let's get back to your visitor
             last night.

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             The Devil.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Alright, the Devil. Why would the
             Devil visit you? It's already
             hell in here, what would he have
             to gain?

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             He came to fuck an angel.
                     (giggles at that)
             I'm his dirty angel.
Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER
AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up.

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             He grabbed me by the hair while I
             sucked him and usually I love
             that, I just do -- maybe you can
             tell me why I love it so much --
             but not this time, he was just too
             rough --
As suddenly as it went out, now the POWER RETURNS.      A
visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             That's it until Monday. Try and
             get some sleep tonight, okay?

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             Sure, Doctor.
                     (leans in)
             Crazy people hear messages from
             God. Not the Devil. You know
             that, right?

             I didn't say you were crazy.

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             You don't have to say it.
She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this.
Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods
for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away
from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the
asylum.




<b>INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER
</b>
Miranda locks her office, armed with paperwork. The end
of another workweek. DR. PETE GRAHAM, a good ten years
older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             Dr. Grey.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Dr. Graham.
They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues
who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other.      A
lot.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             Power went out again in our wing.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
                     (knows what's coming)
             Same here.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             It's not shrink-appropriate to be
             afraid of the dark, you know?

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             You're not shrink appropriate and
             you're about to get promoted.
             Everybody's afraid of something.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             What am I afraid of?

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Yourself. At least you should be.
             What are you up to this weekend?

             Don't start with that. I already
             turned down the job. We're

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             Good girl.
They have reached an office marked "DR. PHILLIP PARSONS
DIRECTOR" and peer in to see Parsons (50's,
distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the
phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to
exit when he covers the mouthpiece --

<b>                           PARSONS

             Next Wednesday it is, Phil.
He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone
call.




<b>EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT
</b>
Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind.
A GUARD waves her off.




<b>END OPENING CREDITS.
</b>




<b>EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up
ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road.
EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her
down.




<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
SHERIFF RYAN, 40'S, recognizes her and ambles over.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             home, Miranda.

He taps on her hood and heads back to the site.      She
shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn.




<b>EXT. OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge.
Something definitely creepy about this deserted place --







<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING
</b>
Miranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the
machine.

<b>                           MIRANDA

A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the
passenger seat. She reaches for it and when she looks up
we see:




<b>POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
</b>
A TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us.      Naked.
About to get pummelled by us.




<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing.
METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the
car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT --
She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing
back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out
of it.

<b>                           MIRANDA

She stares at the dead phone.      Punches the buttons on it.
No go.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Wonderful.
She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car.




<b>EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT
</b>
Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not
moving. Just standing there. Her back to us.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             Hello?   Are you hurt?   Hello?
Nothing.     As we get closer we see she is covered in
bruises.     Clearly something horrible has happened to her.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             Were you in an accident? Were you
             attacked? It's okay, I'm a doctor.
                     (beat)
             My name is Miranda Grey...
And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip,
black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around
the girl --

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             You're in shock right now, that's
             perfectly natural. I'm going to
             get you to the hospital. Okay?
The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm.         Hard.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Don't be scared. It's going to be
             fine.
Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements
desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning
person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Hands off me, okay? Tell me your
             name, do you remember your name?
The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead
she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell.
And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much
stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --

The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as
Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the
girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAWN
</b>
Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat.         Just a bad dream.    A
beat.
FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE
SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely
familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP.
Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of
water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there.
She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And
now she glances around the room and realizes this is not
her bedroom.
She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over
something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat
goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a
small opening in the door. A glass pane.
She peers through the glass at the empty corridor
outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's
inside a cell.
She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic --

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             Hello?   Somebody help me!







<b>EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</b>
CAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard.
Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP
sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens.
The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab
prison, with separate wings (male and female), research
units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.

A bored group of female patients listen to a social
worker lecturing them. A janitor mops a long corridor.
Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of
orderlies.



A doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an
epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as SHELLEY). They
force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing
her tongue, prepare a syringe.

WITH A CART OF MEDS, who nods respectfully as he goes --

An ORDERLY unlocks the door for Pete. Through the glass
pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the
head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's: IRENE.

          Peter, what the hell is going on?
Pete nods at Irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here.

</b>
          How do you feel?

</b>
          How do you think I feel?    Is this
          a joke?
Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the
nurse with the meds to come in. Miranda catches all of
this, growing more agitated. She wears the uniform all
patients wear: a white T-shirt and sweats. Her wedding
ring is gone.

             I don't need to calm down.   What I
             need is an explanation
Pete grabs the meds from the nurse. Irene and the
attendant step closer to help. Miranda feels them
closing in on her. Peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle:

</b>
             Just take this and we can sit down
             and chat.

</b>

She looks at the silent faces around her. No sympathy.
Or maybe too much sympathy. Either way it's unnerving.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I don't want an anticonvulsant, at

                       (final offer)
             Twenty.
The nurse complies. Miranda stares at the meds, trying
desperately to put this into some kind of perspective.

Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant.

Miranda paces.       Alone with Pete, she is even more upset.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             Miranda, this is very awkward.
             Technically I shouldn't even be
             treating you but the court has
             granted us a waiver until you're
             transferred. So whatever is said
             here won't leave this room. I
             won't tell Parsons, I won't tell
             anyone.

He hesitates, unsure where to begin.

             Hi, my name is Miranda Grey. I'm a
             psychiatrist. I transferred here to
             the Woodward Forensic Institute a
             little over a year ago. My job
             entails dealing with a ward of
             schizophrenic women between the
             ages of eighteen and fifty-fife --

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             I don't mean how long you've
             worked here, I mean how long
             you've been staying here.
This stops her. Wanting desperately to whip out a
comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I'm a doctor, yes? Or was medical
             school just an elaborate dream?

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             Of course you're a doctor. A
             great doctor in fact.
The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Pete, how long have I been here?

<b>                          PETE
</b>
             Five days.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
                     (barely audible)
             What?

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             You were admitted to the
             neurosurgical unit seizing
             violently. That lasted three
             days. Scans revealed left-sided
             weakness, numbness and severe
             fontal lobe deficits.
Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we --

</b>
             You were tied down for a day and a
             half so you wouldn't hurt yourself
             and then you went into a state of,

             You've been pretty much catatonic.

             Doug must be worried sick.   I need
             to call him --
Pete shakes his head emphatically.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             You're the most logical person I
             know, bar none. Plus you have a
             photographic memory -- unconfirmed,
             but you do remember events and
             phrases more accurately than anyone
             around. Why am I telling you this?

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             You're establishing my personality
             as fairly intellectual, you don't
             consider me impulsive or emotional.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             And that's a fair assessment, no?

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Yes, that's fair. And following
             this pattern of analysis, we're
             about to discuss a traumatic event
             that rendered this psychological
             profile useless, correct?

A pause here. He's waiting for her to continue. She's
not used to being on the other side of the therapist's
table.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             You think I'm in denial. That I'm
             putting on a brave show -- that
             this is a 'cover' for some
             unbearable emotion I'm hiding.
             Why?

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             Don't analyze yourself, just focus
             on remembering.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I remember Friday night after
             work, if you say that was five
             days ago --
                     (pushing on)
             Anyway, I asked you what you were
             doing for the weekend and you said
             the usual and you made a joke
             about writing country songs and
             drinking yourself to sleep and I
             told you I was going to look at
             some real estate in Willows Creek
             with Doug.

<b>                           PETE

             And then what?

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Then I drove home.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             And then what?

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I got home, I guess, and had
             dinner by myself because --
                     (pauses, struggling)
             Because Doug had an alumni meeting
             at his school and he was going to
             get a ride back. He's the
             principal now, as you well know.
She stops here. Pete waits. The silence is deafening.

             Anything at all?
Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to
dial:

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             This is preposterous.    What's
             wrong with Doug?

<b>                             PETE
</b>
             He's dead.
This stops her cold. Time stands eerily still. She
stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he
will contradict his statement.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             No, he's not. Don't tell me that.
             Don't tell me that.
                     (sickened)
             Are you -- sure?

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             I'm positive.
                     (painful beat)
             You killed him.







<b>INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Irene and TWO NURSE rush to Miranda's cell.      WE HEAR her
hysterical CRIES from inside --

<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
</b>



Pete struggles to contain Miranda, who howls
disparagingly.

<b>                         PETE
</b>
           It's going to be alright, Miranda.
           You just need to sleep. It's
           going to be alright --
Off Pete's nod, a nurse injects the syringe into
Miranda's arm. They hold her down with great effort as
she continues to cry, and we...

</b>

<b>FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
A blur of images and scrambled snippets of memories come
at us rapid-fire, like a drug-induced dream:







<b>EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT
</b>
Miranda's CAR SCREECHES to a stop and she jumps out,
glances around.




<b>INT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</b>
Graduation night. School principal Douglas Grey shakes
hands with proud parents and clumsily formal students.
Miranda grabs a drink from a nearby tray, bored.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>
                   (re: her drink)
           Is that number three?

<b>                         MIRANDA
</b>
           Yes, Mr. Principal. Special
           occasion -- I'm celebrating how
           proud I am of my husband tonight.
He smiles weakly at the compliment. Moves his hand
towards her, in an affectionate gesture (or so Miranda
thinks) but instead fixes her bra strap. Ever
methodical.




<b>EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
</b>
Miranda and a man exit the theater.    Giggling.

<b>INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
</b>



Doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains.
Bloodstained axe on floor in f.g. Walls covered with

<b>INT. LOFT - NIGHT
</b>
A flustered Miranda fumbles with her purse and keys,
heads for the door. She tries to fix her smeared
lipstick and messed-up hair. TURNS TO CAMERA:

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          I'm sorry. The fact is I'm
          married and I -- this is not me,
          this is a mistake.
First we hear our mystery man's voice, then we see him:
Pete. (Yes, the same person she kissed and went to the
movies with.) He places his hand on the door, blocking
her.

<b>                        PETE
</b>
          Your marriage is the mistake and
          you know it.

<b>                          MIRANDA
</b>
          Don't.

<b>                        PETE
</b>
          I'm sorry. That was out of line.
          I feel like a school kid hiding
          from the Principal.

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          We are hiding from the Principal.
He smiles. Touches her face tenderly. Torn. A person
used to doing the right thing but not liking that at the
moment.

<b>                         PETE
</b>
          I would just like to spend some
          time together.

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          We spend time together every day.

<b>                        PETE
</b>
          I meant minus the schizophrenic
          women.

<b>                          MIRANDA
</b>
          I have to go.    I need time to think.

He nods.     Opens the door for her.     She starts to walk
away.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             Don't be too hard on yourself, Dr.
             Grey. You haven't done anything
             wrong.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             Not yet.   But I want to.




<b>EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
PUSH INTO a quiet house on a quiet suburban street. Two
Volvos parked in the driveway. Perfectly-kept front lawn.

Another near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the
floor covered with bloodstains. Bloodstained axe on
floor in f.g. Walls covered with bloodstains.




<b>EXT. CHAPEL - DAY
</b>
Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly
hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a
handkerchief.




<b>INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick
streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand,
noticing the blood -- and now we are back in --




<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</b>
Miranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the
room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes
her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across
the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched.
We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like
somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see
anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks
through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She
glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and
bangs on the door.

</b>




<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Can I get some assistance here?
             Hello?!



She waits.     Bangs on the door again.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             Irene?!   Anybody!?
A beat. And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.
A light is switched on down the corridor.
The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER... and CLOSER...
Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her
forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right
out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES
it.
Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens.
Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and
peeks --
The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a
pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda
jumps back, screams.
And when she looks up again, the image is gone.      A beat.
Rational thought kicking in --

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
                     (to self)
             Wake up, wake up...
                     (beat)
             You're dreaming. It's not real.
             An anxiety dream, that's all.
             That's all. This is dream logic.
             If it was real, they would have
             heard you scream. There are
             twenty employees on the night
             shift. Fact. At least twenty.
She props herself with her back against the wall. With a
view of the whole cell. Just in case. Staring at the
door.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I'm just dreaming.
And now, FAINTLY at first, but GROWING LOUDER --
FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside. Just like
before.

</b>
             I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm
             dreaming, I'm dreaming.



Like her life depends on that mantra. The FOOTSTEPS get
CLOSER. And her voice begins to falter --

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
                     (voice rising)
             I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming --
And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before
and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are
hit with the sudden glare of returning light.
EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS --

<b>                           IRENE (O.S.)
</b>
             Rise and shine, ladies!




<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY
</b>
Irene tries to shake Miranda awake.       An orderly and nurse
stand by.

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
                     (shaking her)
             That means you, honey.   Up -- !
No reaction.

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
             Rise and shine now.    Wake up.
She shakes her harder. And now Miranda's EYES SHOOT OPEN
and she grips Irene's arm. Hard. Like the teenage girl
did.

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
             Easy now, it's okay.
Miranda stares at her, coming back to. Starts to speak
but has no voice. Clears her throat --

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I need to see Peter Graham.

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
             And you have a session scheduled
             this afternoon --

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Doctor Grey, if you don't mind.

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
             Actually I do mind. I start
             calling you 'doctor' and everybody
             else wants to be called 'doctor' --

</b>
             Please. It's a bit different,
             wouldn't you say -- ?
Irene reaches out her hand and the nurse places a cup
with meds on it.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             What do you think you're doing?    I

             My job.
Irene shoves the meds into Miranda's mouth --

</b>
             C'mon, Irene, don't do this. I'm
             calm now, look -- I'm calm -- !
She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates
her.




<b>INT. REC ROOM - DAY

DRIFTING PAST the female patients at their usual activities.
Some watch TV, play dominoes, some pretend to read, some
stare out blankly. Here's Chloe at a table, engaged in

             Twenty points and a soda.
CAMERA FOLLOWS HER INTENT GAZE to another patient,
SHELLEY (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit)
moseying across the room. Nervously takes a seat beside
Miranda.

<b>                           SHELLEY

             Hi there, Doc.
It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to
react. She looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out
of it.

<b>                           SHELLEY

             I never got shrinked by you but

             you, I mean, that's just hearsay
             and I don't pay much attention to
             hearsay because now they say you

Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled
NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. Shelley catches this look and slides
it over to her. Without malice, like a child.

             They put your picture in the
             paper.
It reads "SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SLAUGHTERED. WIFE UNDER
ARREST." Photos of Miranda, Douglas, their house.
Miranda stares at it in disbelief.      Growing sick.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             How did you get this?

<b>                           SHELLEY
</b>
             Chloe did. Who knows how? Not
             me. Around here I'm on a need to
             know basis about stuff and most
             stuff I don't need to know. My
             point is about people talking
             behind other people's backs. Like
             before I was here, everything I
             did I thought, 'this'll get them,'
             wanting their approval, wanting
             them to say good things behind my
             back. But now I'm more anonymous,
             more myself. I'm Shelley.
Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley, clueless as
to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has
no problem holding a conversation all by herself --

<b>                           SHELLEY

             You're not like, undercover here,

             Spring Grove, had a bunch of
             doctors pretend they were
             patients, see if they could handle
             it. Most quit after day one.

<b>                            MIRANDA

             No, Shelley.   I'm not undercover.

<b>                           SHELLEY
</b>
             Because if you were, I'm like the

             anybody.

She hands Miranda paper and some crayons, whispers:

             Drawing is a great cover.   Good

With a wink, she's gone. Miranda looks at the room
around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and
the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about,
arguing --
Life among the insane.

<b>                            IRENE

             You go in last because you're
             special.
                      (off Miranda's look)
             It's not a Mexican prison, toots.
             Everybody here minds their own
             business.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             If it's all the same, I'd
             rather --

<b>                            IRENE
</b>
             State law says we keep you ladies
             clean. And I'm a stickler for the
             law.
                     (beat)
             Now come on. If you go downtown,
             you gotta dance.
Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of
the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like
about institutional bathing.

The shower, like everything else in this place, is
regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of
patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze
on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes
for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last
refrain from the Stones' "START ME UP."

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
                     (checking watch)
             That's five minutes, group one.
                     (to Chloe's group)
             Alright, ladies, nice and easy.
The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past
Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their
many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls:
names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars,
cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda,
slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in
the corner.
A moment later Irene nods for her to go in.




<b>INT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER
</b>
Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her
eyes, trying to shut it all out.
The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda
and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last
two out from the previous group, grab towels.
Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but
Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her
at the tile wall.
More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted
water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a
handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted
pipe.
PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of
blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems
to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system.
The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the
laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the
tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more
blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall.
Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is
the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her
eyes.

             It isn't real. It isn't real.



Opens her eyes.
Five letters are written in blood.       N-O-T-A-L.
Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the
drain, too scared to look back up.

<b>                            MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             It isn't real. You're
             hallucinating.
Perhaps. But now blood drips by       her ankle, DRIP, DRIP,
DRIP. And the shooting pain she       feels is coming from her
arm. What the hell -- ? WE SEE        SHARP SLASHES appearing
on her skin, like some invisible      knife is slicing her.
Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers --




<b>INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA
</b>
Miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked
out to process anything. Fumbles for her clothes and heads
straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Shelley?

<b>                           SHELLEY

             And pick up those damn cigarette
             butts. Jesus, TV is dumb --

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Shelley, can you do me a favor??
Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look.

<b>                           SHELLEY
</b>
             The housewives will find something
             better to do.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Can you go in the shower and tell
             me if you see anything on the wall?
Shelley doesn't respond. Simply crosses over and heads
for the showers. Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her
shoulder makes her jump --

             Yes.   Thank you, Irene.
But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the
towel.

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
             What did you do?

<b>                            MIRANDA

</b>
             What the hell did you do to
             yourself?!
And now the other patients are curiously watching as
orderlies RUSH IN to haul her away.




<b>INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER
</b>
THROUGH a glass pane we see a NURSE bandaging Miranda's
arm. Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room.

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
             I looked away for a second. It's
             unacceptable, won't happen again.

<b>                           PARSONS
</b>
             Not your fault. Patients always
             find a way to hurt themselves if
             that's what they want.

<b>                           IRENE
</b>
             I just didn't peg her for a
             cutter, that's all.
Parsons watches Miranda through the glass.       She can't
look him in the eye.







<b>INT. REC ROOM - LATER
</b>
Miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks
from the other patients as she rejoins them. Spots
Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens. Scared.

</b>
             Listen, Doctor. Some people, they
             have a gift. And in here, because
             they categorize us as a bunch of
             schizos, they refuse to
             acknowledge that. It's like that
             Hubble telescope that sees things
             a trillion miles away but what
             it's seeing is just reflected
             light of a star that died a
             thousand years ago? It's like
             that. Doesn't mean you're crazy.
             It only means your eyes open in a
             different way.
Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but
has a sinking feeling.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             What did it say?

<b>                           SHELLEY

             On the telescope?

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Did you see anything, Shelley?
Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear.

<b>                           SHELLEY
</b>
             That's not tile that wall is made
             out of . It's a holographic
             screen. All part of your mission,
             isn't it?
Miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish.     Walks away.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Thanks anyway.

<b>                           SHELLEY

             any kind of involvement in what

             No. We got disconnected and I

             sat there waiting all night.

             Because the only way you'll be

             Right now I don't trust anyone.
She tries to read his face. Reminds herself of who Pete
is and what he means to her. He points at her bandaged
arm.

<b>                           PETE

             You want to talk about today?
She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head.
Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare:

             I want to talk to my lawyer.

<b>EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY

SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP,

a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered
to her:

<b>                           JENNA

             Huh.
Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly.
Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna
rambles on.

<b>                           JENNA
</b>
             They allow me one match at a time

             so-inconspicuous goon number two

Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being
closely watched by two orderlies.

             Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt
             down the building where I worked.
             I found a baby at the doorstep,
             called the cops -- of course the
             bottom feeding pricks never
             showed. It's beside the point,
             really.
Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about
but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the
building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She
rises --

He turns. His first instinct is to smile. But he checks
himself, reminding himself of her new status. Slips into
his best professional face:

<b>                           MIRANDA

<b>                           PARSONS

             Of course.
                     (checks his watch)
             Well, actually, I'm about to...

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Your staff meeting's done and

             sessions until the afternoon.
             This will just take one minute.
             Promise.
Impressive.    She remembers his schedule perfectly.

<b>                          PARSONS

                     (points)
             But the Sheriff wants to ask me

She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff
Ryan emerges from his patrol car. Miranda nods.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             It's about Pete.

             Perhaps he's not the most
             qualified person to be treating

His tone is fatherly yet direct.

<b>                           PARSONS

             Are you complaining about his
             methods or are you referring to

             What did he tell you?

<b>                           PARSONS
</b>
             He explained there might be a
             conflict of interest because he
             has feelings for you. You two
             engaged in a kiss at one point.
             Am I right?

<b>                             MIRANDA
</b>
             Yes.

<b>                           PARSONS
</b>
             I told him we're all grownups here
             and the fact is he's the best doctor
             on my staff. As such, and given the
             severity of the charges you face, I
             consider him the most qualified person
             to assist your recovery. Now, if
             you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is
             not a patient man.
Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling
like an idiot. Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his
car. The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs
past her, yelling --

<b>                             IRENE
</b>
             Hey!   Chloe!
Now two ORDERLIES race past. Miranda looks over to see
what the fuss is all about. Chloe is on top of an
institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round
black woman named CONSUELO. Punching her --
Other patients have crowded around the scuffle.

<b>                           CHLOE
</b>
             You fucking cow giving me the evil
             eye, huh? Fuck you, you fuckin'
             voodoo witch -- !
Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo. Chloe kicks
and screams like an animal. Consuelo meekly stands up.

</b>
                     (heavy Cuban accent)

Consuelo, full of venom.

             Pobrecita. I was only trying to
             help her --

                       crotch)
             Suck me.
The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd.
Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her
manner says she just wants to get back to her duties.
Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they
were doing.
Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something
catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office
window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd.

Miranda cries softly, unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in

SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts
her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach.

Irene escorts Miranda into the library.       A warden
follows.

The library is pretty    much empty at this hour except for

watch.

</b>
             I'm here as your lawyer. So
             whatever my relationship was with
             Doug is no longer of consequence.
             First things first, how are they
             treating you?

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Like I'm crazy.

             You know this place better than

<b>                           MIRANDA

             The DA is pushing for a hearing as
             soon as next week. They're eager
             to resolve this situation because
             -- well, crimes like this don't
             happen that often around here.
             Doug was a hometown boy who'd done
             good, beloved high school
             principal, a role model. Our best
             shot -- scratch that, our only
             shot -- is to claim temporary
             insanity.
As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy
bandage.

</b>
             Wait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you
             know me. I wouldn't raise a hand
             at my husband for the life of me.
             Not even in self-defense. Isn't
             it remotely possible a burglar
             broke in or some crazed high
             school student attacked Doug and I
             went into shock?
Teddy shakes his head.

             Frankly, no. Neighbors heard
             screams. They have you at the
             scene, they have the murder weapon
             and they have your prints everywhere.
             The only thing they don't have is
             motive.
She keeps absently playing with the bandage. The
adhesive is giving. The bandage starting to peel off.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Because there is no motive.

             And that's what's confusing them.
             The fact that you're a brilliant
             psychiatrist doesn't help either.
             It fills their heads with ideas.
             They figure if you were to plan a
             murder you might know how to fake
             insanity to get out of it.
She pulls off half the bandage, back and forth. Not
looking. BUT WE SEE the beginning of a pattern in her
scarred skin --

             Good. I pass no judgment either

             The point is I'm the only person

             husband. I never thought I'd say
             this, but I feel like I'm in the

                     (beat)
             Do you believe I'm crazy?
An uncomfortable Teddy takes too long before answering.
Miranda looks down, humiliated -- and now she sees it.
Perfectly carved into her arm, her scar reads:

<b>"NOT ALONE."

Petrified, Miranda jumps back, knocks down Teddy's glass
of water all over his papers, her chair topples over.
The warden and janitor look up --

Miranda. Numb. Pete trying hard to get through. A

             I can't help you if you don't talk

Silence from Miranda.     He is firm but not unkind:

             What does it mean?
She shakes her head, at a loss. Torn between her
suspicion and the need to confide in someone. Finally:

between these two. But the moment is far from romantic.

             reality from what's hallucination,

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             As a doctor I agree with you.
             Maybe -- and this is a big maybe
             -- all of this is just a deep
             epilepsy that extends to the
             limbic structures, but I'm telling
             you --

<b>FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick
streak of blood on it. She looks down at Doug, crawling
on hands and knees. He moans horribly, in shock. She
grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He
reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and
makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying
turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles.
Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands.
Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over
her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA.
Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in
the mirror over the mantel and stares --
WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda
stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For
an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there,
beckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left
studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE
around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood
on her clothes, axe still in her hands. Looks back up
at:







<b>THE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA
</b>
shows a serene expression on her face. Fire enveloping
her. She slowly lifts her hands over her head. In place
of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her
wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified -- like
an extreme version of Anima Sola. (A Biblical icon in
which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.)
Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment --
When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to
reality. Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it.

<b>INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - LATER
</b>



Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink. This is
a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it. She
stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at
the marks on the door handle, towels and wall.



Gasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the
shower at full blast and climbs into the tub. She
watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming
back to her body and realizing what she's done, she
slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the
tub. Crying. Shaking.     She shuts her eyes as hard as
she can to make it all go away, and we --

<b>                                    FADE TO BLACK.
</b>




<b>BLACKNESS
</b>
Silence. And now, faintly at first, but GROWING
PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES.




<b>FADE IN:
</b>




<b>INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Miranda wakes up, still in the tub. How long has she
been there, hours? Days? Impossible to know.
But at some point she must have turned off the water.
She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked
with blood.
The first thing that hits her is the stench. And it's foul,
the putrid smell of decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out
of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of
blood, mortified at what she will find.




<b>INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family
reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness
the fruit of her labor. She gasps for air.
Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She doubles over
to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front
door.
She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on
the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still
stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff
Ryan and his deputies right behind. A concerned Pete
Graham behind them.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>



The cops take one look at the place and raise their guns
at her, but we can't hear what they're saying because
Miranda's ragged BREATHING has taken over the soundtrack.
Suffice to say that, at the sight of the guns, something
clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees --




<b>INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
She slips on blood, nearly falls as she scrambles to the
bedroom --







<b>INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM
</b>
She locks the door behind her, hyperventilating in terror.
Instantly there are men POUNDING on it. SQUAWKING RADIOS.
ORDERS BARKED at her. She spots two officers through the
window in her backyard. About to smash the window.
A caged animal, completely surrounded, she covers her face
with her hands. Trembling. The doorknob jiggles violently,
about to give. And when she brings her hands down she is
staring straight into the teenage girl's face. And she
OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE and now we are back in --




<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</b>
Miranda gasps for air, drowning in sensory overload.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Oh God, oh God, oh God...
She rocks back and forth. Finally aware of what she's
done. She is the killer. No more doubts. And now that
she knows, everything is much worse.
A long, harrowing beat.
WE PUSH IN ON her devastated face.       NIGHT TURNS TO DAY.




<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY
</b>
The locks are unlocked. Pete appears at the door.
Miranda glances up at him. She looks like a different
person. Completely destroyed. He crouches beside her.

<b>                          PETE
</b>
             You okay?
She shakes her head slowly. He sets his hand on her
shoulder. She turns to him and hugs him tight, holding
on for dear life. Breaks down in sobs.

<b>INT. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY

Parsons leafs through Miranda's file.   Pete stands by the
window, lost in thought.

<b>                        PARSONS
</b>
          How much does she remember?

<b>                        PETE

          It all came flooding back last
          night.

          Guilt?

<b>                        PETE
</b>
          More like an uncontrollable
          reminiscence. Intense, over-
          cathected. She's not feeling
          guilty of her actions, not
          exactly. Sounds to me like last
          night she actually re-lived them
          in great detail.

<b>                        PARSONS

          Hypermnesis following amnesia.
          Could a specific epileptic element
          be involved?

<b>                        PETE
</b>
          That's exactly what she suggested.
          Even in her present state, her
          instincts remain impeccable.

Pete escorts a fragile Miranda down the corridor.    The
two orderlies walking ominously behind them.

                      them to sit)
             I'm not taking it lightly, no.   We
             will talk about it at home.
Miranda and Pete sit across from him. Miranda trying
hard to appear composed -- acutely aware of her every
gesture, and of how different her last visit to this
office was. Nothing casual about it now.
She stares at the picture frames on Phil's desk (all
facing AWAY FROM us), the diplomas on the wall, the books
by noted fathers of neurology (works by Hughlings
Jackson, Kurt Goldstein, Henry Head, A.R. Luria). A
framed quote reads:
"'If You Do Know That Here Is One Hand, We'll Grant You
All The Rest.' -- Wittgenstein"

                     (into phone)
             Yes, dear. Me too.
He hangs up. Takes a moment to look at Miranda. Tries a
smile but to her it comes off condescending. Fact is --
there's nothing to smile about.

<b>                           PARSONS

             I'm so sorry about this, Miranda.
She nods, dazed. Angles her head to look at a framed
picture on his desk. Parsons looks to Pete.

<b>                           PARSONS
</b>
             Has Pete told you about the

             -- and he's quite resourceful -- to
             prove you're not fit to stand trial.
             Miranda, I know you have no family
             left, so we're your family now and

the desk. Not listening to a word he's saying --

             Who is that?
Parsons pauses here.      Exchanges glances with Pete.

             The girl in the picture.
WE SEE what she is talking about: a framed photograph on

wife Dorothy and a young girl. Our teenage girl.

<b>                            PARSONS

             My daughter.
Miranda looks up at this, perplexed.

             She's the girl I saw.

<b>                           PARSONS

             You're obviously mistaken.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I'm positive. She was hurt,
             bleeding. Is she all right?
Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks.

<b>                           PETE

             every time you've been in this

             Rachel committed suicide six years
             ago.
This shuts Miranda right up.      Mind spinning.

</b>
             That's okay.
                     (to Miranda)
             Rachel was a very troubled girl.
             Handicapped since birth. She was
             born mute. My wife and I tried
             everything to help her fit in
             but... but she ran away from home
             more than once, wanting to end her
             life.
                     (beat)
             And she finally succeeded. Jumped
             off Ashley Bridge. She was only
             seventeen years old.
Ashley Bridge. Mute. Ghost? Miranda hesitates here.
She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full
well what even her suggestion of it will sound like.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Peter, can I speak to you?
The men step outside. PUSH IN ON Miranda's face as she
stares at the picture of Rachel. We catch snippets of
the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her
paranoia --

<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
</b>



Miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic
light. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from
the POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of
the RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes,
looks this way and that, then closes them again.
She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard
before. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP
OPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall.
Squinting to cover every inch of the room.
And now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner.
Roughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed
and slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined.
She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it.
She gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING
LOUDER as she reaches the shadow --
She stretches out her hand and finally touches...
NOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling
stupid.

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          This is not going to work. I'm
          sick of being watched, and I know
          this place well and it doesn't
          smell this bad.
She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head.

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          I'm awake, I'm not dreaming. I'm
          alive -- this is not some
          afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called
          paranormal activity can be
          debunked a million different ways.
          So whatever you are, whatever it
          is I'm making up here -- I'm
          letting you go, I'm setting you
          free. I'm the wrong person. And
          I need to sleep. I'm not afraid
          and I don't believe and I'm fully
          aware that this is all in my mind
          -- fiction -- a concocted
          alternate reality -- and I
          acknowledge it. And now I'm done
          with it. I'm going to sleep now.
The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has
psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. And
now she climbs back in bed.

             let me out of this cell.
A beat. And now we hear the SOUND OF THE DEADBOLT SLIDE
OPEN. The door opens quietly. PUSH INTO Miranda's face.
Properly scared now.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Holy shit.
If proof is what she wanted, proof is what she got.   From
now on we'll refer to the teenage girl as RACHEL.




<b>INT. FEMALE WARD - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
Miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling
the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall --
still making sure she isn't dreaming this.
She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of
neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily.
Nobody there. But when she looks down the other way she
sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So
quick we're not sure we saw it for sure.
Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction.
At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling
quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her
head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells.
She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when
Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing
right across from:







<b>THE NURSES' STATION
</b>
Where two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes
past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.




<b>ANOTHER CORRIDOR
</b>
This one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden
sound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing at
their late night show. Momentarily distracted, she
almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall.
She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a

<b>SANITATION CLOSET.

She looks for something, a tool. Discards a pair of
brushes and finds a small screwdriver. Pockets it.







<b>THE STAIRS
</b>
Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay
clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area.
She waits at the landing, times it just right -- and
scurries to the next floor.







<b>INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS
</b>

<b>ACTION
</b>
Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace
as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner
and stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his
rounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to
her office.
She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the
lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as
fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes
a few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and
clumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against
the floor.
Miranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She
bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for
balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all
along. She simply forgot to check.




<b>INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE
</b>
Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her
computer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch and a
SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view
of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a
smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on.
She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she
waits for it to boot up.




<b>ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR

The JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards
Miranda's office corridor --

Miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the
computer screen reflecting against the glass pane. She
tries opening drawers but they're all locked. She
remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath
the couch, uses it to block the light.
Computer powered up, she runs an online search for
"RACHEL PARSONS." Waits as the info appears --

<b>                           MIRANDA

                     (to self)
             Alright. What happened to you?




<b>ON COMPUTER SCREEN
</b>
Various listings: The archive news of her funeral,
something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about
teen suicide. That's the one she chooses. Hits "PRINT."
She checks the surveillance monitor again:     the janitor
now mops right outside her door.







<b>ON PRINTOUT

The heading says "WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?"
A quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of
three local girls who have died. Rachel's name and
PHOTOGRAPH appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and
Andrea White.
Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance
monitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him
disappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the
screen is empty.
But just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there.
Staring straight at her. Makes us jump.




<b>INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Retracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the
stairs. Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera.




<b>INT. FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
As she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her
way. She detours down another corridor and hides from
view. Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the
staircase.

And now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND. Coming from inside
the room immediately behind her. Room 237. She steps to
the small glass pane on the door and peers inside.







<b>INT. ROOM 237
</b>
It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but
now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some
sort of struggle.
Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a
flash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle.
And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim
light we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling.
Just for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the
bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS

<b>FRAME.
</b>







<b>INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Miranda flinches, confused. Glances down the corridor to
ensure she remains undiscovered. Then peers back in.




<b>INT. ROOM 237
</b>
Chloe on her stomach on the bed. Her pale naked skin
marked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck
in her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open
but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or
sobbing. Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his
T-shirt.
As he discards it we see that it is yellow.




<b>INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Disturbed, Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor
isn't empty. There is a JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup
in hand. Staring at her, disconcerted.

<b>                          JANITOR
</b>
             Hey!
Miranda turns and runs.




<b>INT. FEMALE WARD STAIRS
</b>
Miranda bolts down the stairs. THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS and
YELLS can be heard right behind her.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                      56.
</b>




<b>INT. FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR
</b>



Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency
exit door all the way at the end.
TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase,
shouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their
cells, awakened by the COMMOTION.
Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as
she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty
feet, fifteen, ten --
When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT
appears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid
crashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers
left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and
pins her down.
The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find
her screaming, hysterical. They hold her down --

<b>                         MIRANDA
</b>
           It's him! It's him! Jesus
           Christ, it's him!
The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea
what she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic
woman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and
we --

TRACKING ALONG a long desk where the staff finish their
morning meeting. Parsons, Pete and Irene among others.

</b>
           We've transferred her to a higher
           security room on the fifth floor.
           That's my final concession to any

             Could there be any truth to her

</b>
             Peter, we have one hundred and
             forty employees. Thirty-five work
             maintenance. They all wear yellow
             shirts, it's their uniform. I'm
             holding a very discreet inquiry,
             sure -- but I don't want a news
             van parked outside day and night.
             It makes much more sense that she
             tried to escape and got caught,
             doesn't it?
Pete ponders this.     It certainly seems that way.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             I perused Miranda's files on Chloe
             McGrath -- they're damn
             comprehensive. Maybe she was a
             bit obsessed with her.
Irene and Parsons share a look.     He wraps it up:

<b>                           PARSONS
</b>
             The scariest gift God gave us is
             our minds. And a bright person
             like Miranda -- she's grasping at
             straws here -- who knows what her
             brain is telling her, now that
             it's snapped.




<b>INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - DAY
</b>
A better room, in fact. This one has a view. Heavy bars
on the windows, but still. Miranda paces. Pete is
seated, observing her deteriorating state.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Yes. As a matter of fact, I was
             part of the search party that
             found the body.

             You can imagine. Actually, Phil
             was in Houston undergoing triple
             bypass surgery when it happened.



What was that?     Miranda reacts to this.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             And this is confirmed. There are
             hospital records and so forth?

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             I'm sure there are.   Can we get
             back on track now?
Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket.

</b>
             What about these other dates, was
             Phil here when the other girls
             went missing and found dead?
A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the
pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and
Jenny Dixon.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             Where are you going with this?
             First I'm a suspect in Doug's
             death, now what, Phil Parsons
             murdered his own daughter?

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Rachel Parsons disappeared six
             years ago. A week later she's a
             suicide. Andrew White, four years
             ago, same M.O., and Jenny Dixon,
             two years ago. Don't you find
             that unusual?
He regards her. Maybe Parsons is right: she's
desperately grasping at straws now. Skims the article:

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             What same M.O.? One jumped off a
             bridge, one hung herself and one
             crashed her car. Who gave you
             this?

<b>                            MIRANDA

unlocked and an ORDERLY is there. Peter exits.




<b>INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Peter hurries down the corridor, passing by a nurse. The
same one who bandaged Miranda earlier, so let's give her
a proper name: CLAIRE. She pushes her cart into the
elevator.

Claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she
heads down the long corridor, reaches a door and unlocks
it.

TIGHT ON a row of drug-filled shelves. Claire parks her
cart and kicks off her shoes. Digs a pack of smokes out
of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her.
Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner
type named SIMON. Deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands
all over her. She means to resist but he's got such
boyish charm.

He exits.    She shakes her head, slips her uniform back
on.

Simon presses the button, waits. He checks inside his

<b>                         MIRANDA

           I don't hate you. And I don't
           feel embarrassed.

<b>                         CHLOE

           That's just a pat answer you have

Chloe abruptly grabs her arm.     Tightly.

             You know what happens next?

             I get the distinct feeling you're

             The shock wears off and the guilt
             kicks in. And that guilt is the
             real motherfucker. You'll be
             watched 24/seven, because they're
             afraid you'll kill yourself. Dr.
             Graham will question every harmless
             gesture, every innocent comment, ever
             twitch you make and eventually -- and
             it's a fucking tedious 'eventually'
             -- you'll stop hating yourself for
             what you did. But what replaces that
             hatred is this unbearable sadness. And
             you don't lose that as long as you live.
PUSH IN ON Miranda.     Deeply affected by Chloe's words, as
we --

C) Wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at
night and the lights go off.

Echoing an earlier scene, we are MOVING TOWARDS her --
her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light.
Miranda flicks a look this way and that, alert. Sensing
something.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Leave me alone. Go away.
Just like a crazy person. She listens for any further
noise, hears none and shuts her eyes. Exhausted.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I've lost my fucking mind.   Happy
             now?
Silence. But now the BEDSPRINGS CREAK behind her and she
whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers
her mouth. Her eyes open wide at the sight of Simon, in
his yellow shirt. He shoves her against the mattress and
presses his full weight against her. She lets out a
muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and
brings the plunger to her throat. Straight into her
jugular.

<b>                           SIMON
</b>
                     (sotto)
             This is gonna hurt you more than
             it hurts me.
She flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down.
The BEDSPRINGS STRAIN violently and now he's straddling
her, squeezing the plunger into her throat. Her eyes
welling up:

<b>                           SIMON
</b>
                     (sotto)
             I've always wanted to do a doctor.
She manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from
her throat. It flies to the floor. He grins, enjoying
this:

<b>                           SIMON
</b>
                     (sotto)

             I get, pussycat -- so pretty
             please, with sugar on top -- keep
             still.
Simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend
herself. He finally slaps her free arm down. Presses
his knee against it, immobilizing her once more. Now he
produces another syringe from his pocket. Checks it.
Miranda shakes her head, pleading. A scream stuck in her
throat. But nobody can hear her.
Simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we
hear a LOUD CLANGING at the door. Shaking it off its
hinges.

Simon looks up, confused. Nobody is there. The split-
second distraction is all Miranda needs to shove him off
the bed. She fumbles for the discarded syringe and STABS
HIS CHEST WITH IT -- squeezes the plunger --

                     (sotto)
             Take that, son of a bitch.
Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body
goes limp. Miranda exhales, coming back to herself. A
beat.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Rachel?
No response.     Miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress
him.

<b>SECURITY CAMERA POV

shows a uniformed janitor calmly walking down the
corridor. PULL BACK to see we are in --







<b>INT. SURVEILLANCE BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>
A bank of monitors keep watch on the premises   after dark.
TWO GUARDS play cards (Uno), bored to tears.    A cursory
glance at the monitors produces no reaction.    Certainly a
janitor walking down the corridor is no cause   for alarm.




<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP or whatever it is    crickets
do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing    rows of
unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon's key-ring    button
repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on   and off.




<b>INT. SIMON'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Miranda slips behind the wheel, STARTS the CAR. The RADIO
KICKS IN at EAR-DEAFENING VOLUME. She nearly drops dead.




<b>EXT. WOODWARD GATE - NIGHT
</b>
The gate GUARD reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car
approaches. The guard barely registers the driver in the
booth mirror, immersed in his article. Hits a button to
open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.

Miranda, sweating, watches the receding image of the
institute behind her. Turns on the main road. Free.

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          Thank you, thank you, thank you.
She glances back, makes sure no one is following her.
Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror: the
scared eyes, the haunted face. The new version of
herself.
She flips the RADIO dial: BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. BAD
COUNTRY. BAD DISCO. More BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. She finds
IGGY POP'S entirely appropriate "THE PASSENGER) and lets
it play.




<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Now we are seeing her as if from the POV of someone
traveling alongside the car. Peering THROUGH the
passenger window. Miranda becomes aware of this, slowly
glances over. Sees nothing but her own reflection.
Turns back forward.
We NOTICE the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling
off the dashboard. Nothing but a long stretch of road
ahead.







<b>EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda
parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house.
Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around
back.
She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a
deep breath and lets herself in through the back door.




<b>INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
</b>
POLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the
kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without
even looking in the direction of the living room,
avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether.
Eerie as hell --




<b>INT. BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS

Miranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase, finds her passport,
digs out some cash from a box. Quick change of clothes to
get rid of the rapist's uniform. Fast, fast, fast --

<b>INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Miranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview
mirror as she drives down the block. Shudders. Flips
the RADIO dial with shaky hands.




<b>                          RADIO DJ (V.O.)

            your dial. This next honky-tonk
            heartbreak classic is...
She looks in the rearview mirror once more.      Only this
time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes.
Rachel's.     Inside the car.
Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping
abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet
sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom.
Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180
and slides to a halt in the middle of the street --
Facing the direction of her house again.




<b>EXT. STREET
</b>
Miranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks
inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath,
making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a
U-turn.







<b>INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling
and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked.
She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --

<b>                          MIRANDA
</b>
            No.
The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key
but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and
notices the key is gone.

<b>                          MIRANDA
</b>
            Why are you doing this to me?
A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more
startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the
middle of the street.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                      69.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>



Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty
street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys.
We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The
moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the
glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda
jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened
by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes.
She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in
her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the
pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now.
BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround
the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS
fastened around the insulators of a thick power line.
From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys.
And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming
loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some
invisible force --
Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP
and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE
WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings
straight towards the paralyzed Miranda --
She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle,
back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to
a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The
wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends
SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like
lightning.
A silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets.

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
                  (fighting tears)
          What do you want from me?
No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing
over her shoulder, seemingly demented:

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          What is it you want me to do?!!
A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the
middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING
abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the
sound.
It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door
SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.

Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I can't.
                     (softly)
             Please, please don't make me go
             back in there.
But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards
it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the
road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost
electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate
yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.




<b>INT. SIMON'S CAR
</b>
Miranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here.
She's never asked a ghost for permission before:

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Bear with me, I'm just parking it
             out of the way so it won't look
             suspicious in the middle of the
             road -- okay.
She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk.







<b>INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
</b>
Miranda stands in her living room, staring at her
handiwork. Frozen with dread.
The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains.
The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk
outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the
shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied
footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc.
The faded writing on the wall:       "NOT ALONE."
Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's
supposed to be looking for.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
                     (piecing it together)

             happened to other girls.
                     (beat)
             I understand. And I'm sorry. But
             there is nothing I can do about it
             now. It has nothing to do with
             me.

Not knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the
TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump.
The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL

<b>BLAST.
</b>



She stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she
should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and
immediately doubles over in pain --

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             Shit.
She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck
right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin.
Blood already seeping from the nasty cut --




<b>INT. BATHROOM
</b>
Miranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out
the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She
grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the
cut.
And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears
the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel.
Inside the room with her --
Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror
move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds
perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have
STOPPED. A silent beat.
She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing
as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful.
And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes
her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like
the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked
arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola.
She stares.     Mesmerized.    The sound of FLAMES GROWING

<b>LOUDER.
</b>

<b>                             MIRANDA
</b>
             No.   No.   No...
Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the
image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if
the two versions of her are literally walking towards
each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces
mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the
mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back.

Miranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt.
The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically
impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again --
the image is gone.



It is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself
staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something
just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far
corner of the room.
She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY
LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks
it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank-
repossessed property.
The address is in Willows Creek.
Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel
wanted her to see. She stares at it.
PUSH IN ON the picture as we --

<b>EXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN
</b>
A "FOR SALE" sign still flapping in the wind.   The first
few rays of light break through the dawn sky.
Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it
FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out.
She studies the house before walking up the drive. We
watch her peek through windows and walk around back,
looking for something. What exactly, we don't know.
(Neither does she.)
She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes
her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't
looked.







<b>INT. BARN
</b>
Dark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING
to FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's
just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large
room, perplexed. There is something about this place.
Something she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning
her.
With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front
door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops
her. She moves to it.

And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow
gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A
padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both
walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy
padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall
and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only
a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness
beyond, but can't see a thing.
Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides
herself into the claustrophobic slot.
She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face
brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops,
startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light
bulb.
She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow
to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of
her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY
CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below.
Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs
down.




<b>INT. SECRET BASEMENT
</b>
Miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness.
Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb
upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall
for a switch. Nothing.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
                     (to self)
             It's not shrink-appropriate to be
             afraid of the dark, right?
Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key-
chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast
space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient
ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's
reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it.

<b>                          MIRANDA
</b>
             Hello?
She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on
the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half-
light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles
through it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds
a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next
to the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named

<b>"TRACY MARIE SEAVER."

             Is there anybody here?   Hello?
The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it
click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped
a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation.
Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can
make out the metallic thing that reflected light before.
It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are
several heavy chains.
Like a meat rack.
And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and
sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down,
tied around the hands and ankles.
Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the
girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter
away.

<b>                            MIRANDA

             Go away!   Fuck off!
(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so
that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an
almost strobe-light effect:)
She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's
adrenaline at full tilt --

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the
girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly,
clinically.
The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the
immediate surroundings:   household tools strewn about;
wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Wake up, Tracy, wake up --
Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles.
The skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the
girl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too
late.

<b>EXT. BARN - LATER
</b>



Miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and
throws up. The bright light outside blinding her
momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to
register --







<b>THE PATROL CAR
</b>
parked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER
cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up
and notices her.
Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run.      The officer waves.
His name is TURLINGTON.

<b>                         OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
          Howdy there.
He says this while already strolling over.        Miranda's
mind races a mile a minute --

<b>                        OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
          Everything okay?

<b>                         MIRANDA
</b>
          Y-yes.

<b>                        OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
          That your vehicle, ma'am?
She stares at the young, friendly cop. His left hand
resting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it
seems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet.

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          Yes -- I -- I just pulled over.     I
          was -- looking for a bathroom.
          Morning sickness, you know...

<b>                        OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
          Congratulations. But I'm afraid
          this is private property -- you
          can't just waltz on in. You
          understand that.
She nods, nerves shot to hell.     Starts walking.

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          I'll be on my merry way now. My
          husband will never forgive me if I
          get a ticket for trespassing.

</b>




<b>CONTINUED:
</b>



The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of
marital dynamics. He flashes a smile but suddenly stops,
whips out his gun and trains it on her --




<b>                           OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
             Holy shit.
                     (clicks the safety
                      off)
             Lady, stay right where you are.
Miranda shuts her eyes, busted.     Freezes.

<b>                           OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
             Hands up where I can see them.
Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.

<b>                           OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
             Nice and slow, start talking to
             me. And make it good. Tell me
             just exactly who that is.
A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's
looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging
herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock.
Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive.
But just barely.




<b>EXT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY

A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area.       Phil Parsons and
Pete step out, rush inside.

Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he
can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his

             Mr. Howard -- there isn't evidence
             because the overdosed janitor
             hasn't woken up, that's why -- and
             when your client was questioned on

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom.
             Your client was read her rights and
             she still insisted --

<b>                           TEDDY HOWARD

             -- Let me ask you this, Sheriff:
             what exactly was a janitor doing
             with several vials of sedatives
             inside my client's cell? And is
             it not possible he had taken some
             drugs himself before my client --
Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to
the waiting room, Teddy following closely --




<b>INT. ER WAITING ROOM
</b>
Paramedics and nurses doing their thing. The young
officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of
coffee.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             I'm not a drug expert. I'm simply
             stating the frigging facts.
Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices
Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face.

             An 'incident' -- for lack of a
             better frigging word -- involving
             Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's
             been tortured and is in critical
             condition and chances are slim
             she'll even utter another word.

             A runaway from Portland, Tracy
             Marie Seaver. Reported missing a
             couple weeks ago. We found Miss
             Grey in some barn off Willows
             Creek with the girl all messed up.
             I'm just now waiting for the

                     (to Teddy)
             Notice, Counselor, how I'm not
             even mentioning her trespassing or
             lying to a police officer.
Teddy waves him off in frustration.     Goes to talk to
Turlington.

             Christ, the woman's got the entire

             He's not at liberty to answer

The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to
the water cooler where they can talk more privately.

             We need to get Miranda back to the

Parsons nods, lost in thought.        Sheriff Ryan returns.

             Phil, how well does your wife know

             Because she's at the station right
             now, demanding to speak with her.
Parsons frowns at this, concerned.        Pete studies him.




<b>INT. COUNTY STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY
</b>
Bare room. A desk and two chairs. Glass window         panes to
insure no privacy. DOROTHY PARSONS (50s) waits,        seated.
The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in.        She sits
across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be.        A long
beat.

<b>                            DOROTHY
</b>
             How are you?
Miranda doesn't answer. Her mind elsewhere.         Namely back
at the barn and how it connects to Rachel.

<b>                           DOROTHY
</b>
             I needed to see you, but I'm not
             sure where to begin. I don't know
             you well, I certainly have nothing
             but fond feelings for you. Phil
             always keeps me posted on his
             colleagues and his work and -- in
             any case, I have always thought of
             you as a very bright, very
             perceptive doctor. Even though I
             don't know you well.
She pauses here. Miranda looks up now. Her face hollow
and exhausted. Bags under her eyes. A person who has
seen too much. Wondering where the hell this is going.

<b>                           DOROTHY
</b>
             My point is, my point being --
             when Rachel died I had, um, I
             suffered through these spells,
             these recurring dreams.

             And eventually, once I came to
             terms with her death, they went
             away. Losing a child is the
             hardest, most inconceivable event
             a mother can --
She drifts off.     Takes a beat to collect herself and
resume:

<b>                           DOROTHY
</b>
             The past few days I have been
             having the same dream. A
             nightmare.
Miranda can't help but smile to herself at that.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             That word.   Nightmare.   Welcome to
             my life.

<b>                           DOROTHY
</b>
             This nightmare involves Rachel but
             it also involves you. In the
             nightmare Rachel holds a box in
             her left hand. A small box. And
             she repeats a series of numbers.
             Now, Rachel never spoke, from the
             time she was born -- she had a
             condition -- I often asked God why
             he punished this child in such a
             way -- she couldn't speak, but she
             was extremely bright. She wasn't
             autistic as the doctors claimed --
Dorothy Parsons starts to cry. A moment passes like
this. It seems she won't recover enough to continue her
tale.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Mrs. Parsons, you need a
             therapist. Normally I would
             encourage you to schedule a
             session with me but as you can
             see --
Dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish.       She pulls
out a folded piece of paper.

<b>                           DOROTHY
</b>
             Every night the same box in her
             hand and the same numbers. I
             wrote them down.

She slides the paper over. Miranda watches her
carefully, then looks at the piece of paper. The numbers
are:




<b>1-0-2-2-0-1.
</b>
A long beat.

<b>                           DOROTHY
</b>
             It's a message. It's a code for
             something. I don't know what.
             But she wants you to have it.
Miranda studies it. Studies this woman, who quite
frankly seems to have completely lost her mind. Then she
looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a
realization.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             October 22nd, 2001. It's my

She stares at Dorothy, stunned. Brain click-click-
clicking. Her wildest fears confirmed: Doug is behind
this somehow.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             That code belongs to a safety
             deposit box my husband kept in a
             bank up in Newcastle, that's where
             his parents live.

             Dorothy, I need you to drive up
             there and open it.
Dorothy stares at her, scared.     And finally nods.

Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as

one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS.

approaches.

A moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort.
Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door.
An uneasy Pete leads. Irene and the wardens at the rear.



Miranda glances at the women staring at her like a
specimen. Like somehow she's even more dangerous than
them. Top dog, as it were, of the crazies.
And then, halfway across the room, one of the women
stands up. Chloe. She claps her hands together.
Slowly. Miranda watches her, confused. And slowly

joining Chloe in clapping.

mouths the words "thank you."
And Miranda is hauled out the side door.

Pete is at the end of his rope. Can't hide his sadness
when he looks at her. Still, he tries to get her back on

             Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were
             also abducted and murdered -- now
             this was before I met Doug but I
             bet you anything that they both
             went to his school. Then he
             obviously stopped for a while:
             fear, guilt, distractions --
             namely me -- delayed him from
             reverting to his sickness. That's
             why I didn't notice anything. I
             believe he really tried to lead a
             normal life, for me. Then along
             comes Tracy Seaver and he can't
             resist. Locks her up and tortures
             her in some abandoned property --
She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing.

             Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off
             ghost with an agenda, furious at
             her parents for giving up on
             her -- she's been trying to
             communicate with them for years
             but they're too goddamn logical to
             pay attention -- and she picked
             me, she sought me out that night
             and sent me home to fix her
             problem. Made sure I killed Doug
             because he was going to do the
             same thing to Tracy Seaver as he
             did to her. And she will get rid
             of anyone who stands in her way.
Pete takes all of this in.     Dumbfounded.

Pete can see that she's petrified. He starts to speak,

him have it:

She turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the
first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car.




<b>INT. BANK VAULT - DAY

A solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table
in the middle of the room. Steps back through the gate
and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a
moment.
Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife
and opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means
nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope. He
opens it and spills the contents on the table.
It is a stack of POLAROIDS.
Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens. She
grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit
down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes
out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales,
all blood draining from his face.

             under your incompetent nose for
             over six years. We don't know how
             many future victims were spared,
             but we do know she saved that girl
             in the barn's life. And that's
             more than you or I can say -- !

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Calm down. For the record, that
             girl is on a ventilator. The
             doctors don't think she'll make it
             through tonight.

</b>
             Now, you want to stand up in a
             courtroom and tell a judge that a
             ghost is behind all this, that's
             your prerogative -- but I have to
             abide by the law. And the law
             says Miranda Grey faces criminal
             chargers. So here's what we're
             going to do. I'm going to leave a
             cruiser outside to make sure you
             don't go anywhere tonight and two
             of my deputies will go guard Ms.
             Grey until tomorrow morning.
             Phil?
Parsons doesn't respond.     His eyes far away.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             There will be no breakouts, no
             aiding and abetting, no taking the
             law into your own hands. It'll
             take an Act of God for Miranda
             Grey not to show up in that
             courtroom tomorrow. Are we clear?
And now the Sheriff can see that Parsons is crying.
Quietly, miserably. And it's a disparaging sight.
Sheriff Ryan exits. Two deputies follow, RADIOS

<b>SQUAWKING.
</b>
Parsons remains still for a moment, then digs a
photograph out of a drawer. A picture of Rachel in
happier times.

<b>                           PARSONS
</b>
             I'm sorry. I will never forgive
             myself for what happened to you.
             Not as long as I live.
                     (breaking down)
             I miss you so much.
He sits there, staring at his dead daughter. Grieving.
WE PULL BACK to see he is not alone. Rachel is watching
him.




<b>EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT
</b>
The WIND has really PICKED UP now. A massive LIGHTNING
BOLT streaks the sky, officially announcing the storm's
onset.
A POLICE CRUISER pulls up to the guard gate.

</b>

<b>                                                            93.

<b>INT. WOODWARD SURVEILLANCE BOOTH
</b>



PAN OFF the bank of monitors TO the same two guards we've
seen before. Playing yet another bored card game. The
LIGHT RAPPING on their glass door makes them look up.




<b>                             GUARD #1
</b>
             Help you?
TWO OFFICERS stand there.       We recognize one of them:

<b>                           OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
             We're here on Miranda Grey detail.
The Guards shake their heads, chuckle.

<b>                           GUARD #1
</b>
             Sixth floor. You can get a couple
             chairs from the nurses up there.
             A pretty decent cup of joe too.

<b>                             OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Thanks, guys.
The Guard points at the bank of monitors.

</b>
             Although why the Sheriff is making
             you fellas waste your time is
             beside me. We got her right here.
             She ain't going no place.




<b>ON MONITOR
</b>
Miranda inside her pristine white cell.       Restlessly
pacing.

<b>                           OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
             Looks perfectly harmless, doesn't
             she?

</b>
             Don't they all, Officer, don't
             they all?
The men share a chuckle over that one when suddenly
THUNDER CRACKLES and the power goes out.
No monitors, no radio, no nothing.       Pitch black.

<b>                            GUARD #1
</b>
             Shit.   There goes the card game.
Abruptly there's a SERIES OF sharp CLICKS as FOUR
FLASHLIGHTS come alive.

<b>INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL
</b>



The THUNDER outside RATTLES the WINDOW PANE. The only
light source being the intermittent LIGHTNING as the

<b>STORM RAGES.
</b>



She paces in the dark.    Sits.   Waits.




<b>INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - STAIRS - SAME TIME
</b>
The two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs.







<b>INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME
</b>



Miranda holds her breath, listens. And sure enough,
somebody else is in the room. She looks around.

<b>                          MIRANDA
</b>
          No.   No.   What do you want -- ?
And now LIGHTNING streaks the room and we see Rachel in
the corner. Staring with her dead eyes. Moving towards
her.

<b>                         MIRANDA
</b>
          I've done everything you've asked
          me to. My life is ruined. I
          can't take this anymore. I
          can't...
                   (faintly)
          You have to step into the light,
          Rachel. You don't belong here --
          you don't belong...
But it doesn't work. Rachel keeps walking towards her.
Miranda backs up against the wall. Trapped. Fighting
tears --

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
          Into the light --
                  (loudly)
          Can somebody come in here?       I need
          help. Somebody, please!

The cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights
down the corridor. They walk towards them.

          And who are you?

             Officer Turlington, ma'am. We're
             supposed to sit outside Miranda
             Grey's cell all night.




<b>                           IRENE

             Knock yourself out. Next floor up.

             It's only a power outage, ladies
             -- let's call it an early night.
The cops head down the corridor.

Rachel stretches out her arm to Miranda's face --

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Please don't. Why are you doing
             this? It's over. Over and done!
Rachel slowly shakes her head, places her hands on
Miranda's eyes and shuts them --

<b>                                       FLASH CUT TO:
</b>







<b>MIRANDA'S VISION - ANDREA WHITE

in her school uniform. Staring straight ahead. Now the
image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her
half-naked, bruised. Dead.

<b>                                       FLASH CUT TO:

<b>JENNY DIXON

staring AT us in her school uniform. Now abruptly she is
a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also
bathed in the strange red and blue light --

<b>END OF MIRANDA'S VISION.

<b>INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda screams at the visions.    Rachel holds her steady.

<b>                          MIRANDA
</b>
             Stop it! I don't want to see

Now a heavy RATTLING makes her turn to the door. One of
the HINGES has SHATTERED and the latch itself is half-
pulled from the doorframe. Relentless POUNDING on the
other side.




<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Let me out of here! Let me out!
There's a deafening SOUND like a thousand bells ringing
at once and Miranda covers her ears --
Outside WE HEAR MURMURS, YELLS, INSTRUCTIONS --




<b>INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR
</b>
The cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung
open. Confused patients spill out as guards and nurses
try to restore order. RADIOS SQUAWK, flashlights beam
and FOOTSTEPS fill the dark corridor as patients try to
escape.







<b>EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT
</b>
FIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS
blazing. Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from
their cars to contain the breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT
comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run for the garden
wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush
after her.




<b>INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE

Sheriff Ryan makes his way through the mayhem, past Irene
helping a patient, past nurse Claire cowering in a corner --

frantically with his flashlight --

A car pulls up at the scene.     Pete and Parsons step out.

Pete rushes up the steps --







<b>INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR
</b>
Officer Turlington looks inside Miranda's cell. Empty.
And as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her:
Seated by the elevator. Holding a biting block in
Shelley's mouth as her seizing subsides.

<b>                           OFFICER
</b>
                     (into radio)
             Sheriff? I have Miss Grey right
             here.
He flashes his light at her.     Miranda looks back blankly.

<b>                           OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
             Sorry, we thought you might have
             made a run for it.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Page Irene ASAP. This patient
             needs her meds.
Turlington nods. Miranda looks down at a grateful
Shelley, whose head is cradled in her lap. Brushes the
matted hair off her face. Carefully removes the biting
block, making sure Shelley is alright.

<b>                           SHELLEY
</b>
                     (after a beat)
             You're gonna get that Pulitzer
             after all.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             I told you I could keep a secret.







<b>INT. REC ROOM - LATER

The patients are all assembled here. Flashlights galore.
Irene and Consuelo do head counts. Guards, officers,
janitors -- everybody. Irene points a finger at Jenna.

</b>
             Give me a break. You wouldn't
             respect me if I hadn't tried --
Parsons breaks away from Turlington, heads over to Pete
and Miranda --

<b>                           PETE

             Everybody accounted for?

             We're doing the final count.   Now
             they can't find the Sheriff.
Miranda scans the near-dark room, looking for someone.
Watches Turlington step aside to take a call on his
radio.   Parsons regards her with newfound respect:

<b>                           PARSONS

             Are you alright, Miranda?

<b>                            MIRANDA

             Fine, Phil.   Thanks for asking.
Suddenly all the policemen in the room begin to exit --

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             What's going on, Officer?

<b>                            OFFICER TURLINGTON

             One of your patients is holding
             the Sheriff at gunpoint. She's in
             the cafeteria.
Pete glances at Miranda.      She knows exactly who it is:

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Chloe.
Turlington is about to exit when Parsons stops him:

<b>                           PARSONS
</b>
             I think Doctor Grey should be the
             one to talk to her.




<b>INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

The DOOR CRASHES open and Chloe shoves the Sheriff
inside. She has a gun pressed hard against his ear.

             Do it quick.   I won't make fun of

The sound of the UPSTAIRS DOOR BEING THROWN OPEN makes
her glance up. She trains her flashlight at the second
level, stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover.

             You have to let him go.   I'm sorry.
Chloe flinches at that. Like all this multitasking is

neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style --

             That's a lie! I'll never stop
             being sick, they'll just find
             something new that's wrong with
             me. No wonder you doctors can't
             help anyone -- all you have are
             deficit columns and stupid tests
             designed to point out what part of
             the puzzle you think we're missing!

She starts sobbing.     Letting everything go --

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             You're right, doctors never
             concentrate on the things patients
             are actually capable of. But I
             know you, Chloe, you've been
             through things that most people
             don't survive. And you have a
             wonderful future in front of you
             if you choose it. It's up to you.
This gets through to Chloe.       Her grip loosens on the gun.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             No more guilt, no more hatred, no
             more unbearable sadness. You have
             no use for any of that anymore.
             Your life begins this very second.

</b>
             I'm so tired.    So goddamn tired --
Miranda walks over and embraces her.       Chloe hands her the
gun.
And that's when the power returns.
Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan
on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning
light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every
RADIO, PHONE, FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO

<b>LIFE.
</b>
Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in
the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the
cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea
White and Jenny Dixon visions.
Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning
of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the
Sheriff, finally struck with the realization:

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             It was you, wasn't it?

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             What are you talking about?
She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup-
style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES, ARMS RAISED, SHACKLED.
Anima Sola. Miranda's recurring vision from the night of
the slaughter.

</b>
             'Not alone.' That's what Rachel
             has been trying to tell me all
             along. Doug was not alone. You
             were with him. This whole time
             it's been you. You covered up
             their deaths to look like
             suicides.
The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking --

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             You've lost your mind.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Don't fucking move.
The CLICK! of a SAFETY being released makes him pause.
He turns to look at her. A tense beat.

<b>                           PETE (O.S.)
</b>
             Miranda, don't do it!
She glances at Pete's pleading face and the room around
her: cops everywhere. All guns trained on her.
Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the
following:

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             And just exactly who would believe
             you? No proof, no living witness.
             Everybody knows you're crazy.
Miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off.
Her hand starts to shake. Sheriff Ryan turns and strides
off. Getting away. Further. Further...
But as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to
do it. Finally brings the gun down. The armed policemen
rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff
her.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             I want that woman in custody. She
             has a judge to face in the morning.




<b>EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT (HEAVY RAIN)
</b>
Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser.
He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when
Pete suddenly taps on Miranda's window, startling her --

She shakes her head.     Mouths something Pete can't make out.

<b>                           OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
             Sir, please --

<b>                           PETE

             What?
Turlington hits the gas. Miranda presses her face
against the window so only Pete can see her say the
following:

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             The girl in the hospital.
Pete locks eyes with her, nods -- as the cruiser leaves.




<b>INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - RECOVERING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Tracy Seaver lies unconscious, hooked up to a series of
machines. PULL BACK to find Pete with a young DOCTOR.

<b>                           DOCTOR
</b>
             Her condition remains the same.
             Basically that ventilator is
             keeping her alive. We have no
             reason to think she'll ever wake
             up. I'm sorry.
Pete nods, disconcerted.      Stares at the girl.

<b>                           PETE
</b>
             You mind if I stay here tonight?

             That's me.   Excuse me.
The Doctor rushes off.




<b>INT. RECOVERY ROOM #2
</b>
Like Tracy Seaver, Simon Reynolds is hooked up to a bunch
of machines and cables. Suddenly his EYES SHOOT OPEN and
the CARDIAC ALARM SQUEALS --
Two NURSES rush in.       The young Doctor right behind.

<b>                            NURSE #1
</b>
             V-tach.
The EKG whipsaws. The Doctor feels for a pulse, then slaps
on the defibrillator pads, places the paddles on the chest --

<b>                            DOCTOR
</b>
             Clear!
He begins chest compressions on Simon's heart. He spasms
violently once, twice -- And then it stops. The Doctor
and Nurses stare at the monitor. Flatline.
Unseen by them, Rachel steps out of the room.







<b>EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</b>
WE SEE Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol
car and drive off. WE MOVE INSIDE the empty station...




<b>INT. SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE
</b>
Sheriff Ryan takes a healthy chug from a fifth of Scotch,
slips it back in a drawer. Stares at his hands. Steady as
a rock. Takes a deep breath. Knows what he must do next.
A religious man despite everything, he brings his thumb
to his forehead and crosses himself.




<b>INT. COUNTY STATION - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Miranda's eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS
SLIDING UNLOCKED. Hopeful. Could this be Rachel?

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>



A looming figure appears at the door. Doesn't bother to
shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And
so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:




<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             How did you know?

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>
             You tell me.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             This isn't one of your word
             association games, Doctor. Did
             Douglas tell you that night?

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Why wait this long if he had?

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Maybe it's your amnesia. Maybe
             you blocked it out.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Maybe. But it seems to me that
             it's vital you know for sure.
He studies her. Takes a step towards her. Miranda
responds by stepping back. A slow motion semicircle, if
you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             You think me and Doug are
             monsters. That this was all a
             carefully laid out plan with those
             girls. But it wasn't that at all.
             You do things sometimes and you're
             not sure why you did them. Then
             you realize you can live with them
             and so can everyone else. Life
             goes on.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             If you're looking for forgiveness,
             you came to the wrong place.
She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows
it.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             One thing about fear is it makes
             people say the dumbest things.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             Be that as it may, you're afraid
             too -- because you know killing me
             won't solve your problems.




<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             My only problem is you.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             What about Parsons? And Peter?
             They know. And that girl in the
             hospital will never forget your
             face. You miscalculated, now you
             pay.
Patience tested, he suddenly WHACKS her across the face.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             I hate a bad bluffer.
She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I sure hope that felt good because
             you can't afford too many more
             signs of struggle. Can you?

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Go ahead, hit me back. It's what
             you want.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             No, that's what you want me to do.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Back to profiling, huh? Your
             thought process is completely
             transparent.
And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the
conversation. Analyst and patient in session.      Echoing
her opening scene with Chloe.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             So we're even. You left that door
             open so I'd try and run, it's what
             you get off on, isn't it?

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             I guess we'll find out.

<b>                           MIRANDA

             And yet you have to make me look
             like a suicide. With what, your
             belt?
                     (off his shrug)
             How would I get access to a belt?

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             I don't think that's going to
             satisfy you. You won't be able to
             do this clean. You have too much
             guilt inside.
SMACK! Another slap across the face. Miranda's knees
buckle. But she remains standing. Her lip trembles.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             You're losing grasp of the
             situation. It was different with
             those girls. I bet all they did
             was cry and scream.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN

             Don't worry, you'll scream.
                     (after a beat)
             Take off your shirt.
This throws her off.     She shoots a quick glance at the
door.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             Aren't I a little old for you?

<b>                            SHERIFF RYAN

             Take it off.
She hesitates.    He draws his gun, tired.    Removes the
safety.

<b>                           MIRANDA
</b>
             That's for show. You know you
             can't shoot me.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             But I can smash your teeth out and
             make it look like you bashed your
             head against the wall. Now shut
             up, take off your goddamn shirt
             and pull off your bra.

Miranda is petrified now.      Running out of ways to hide
it.

<b>                            SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Today, Doctor.
In a sudden move, Miranda shoves the chair at him and
bolts out the door. The Sheriff doesn't move to stop
her.




<b>INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape. Takes
quick inventory of the space: two more holding cells
like her own, a row of filing cabinets, and a storage
area with barred windows. She makes a turn up ahead and
reaches another gate down the corridor. A sliding gate
that closes off the cell area from the main station.
She tries the gate. Locked, naturally.       She shakes and
bangs on it, desperate.

<b>                            MIRANDA
</b>

<b>             TURLINGTON!!   SOMEBODY HELP ME!!
</b>
No response. And no way to disguise the sheer panic in
her voice. She fell for his trap. They're all alone
here.







<b>INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - SAME TIME
</b>
Ryan smiles at that. Re-holsters his weapon and walks
towards her, taking his time. Relishing the hunt.

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Doug mentioned you were painfully
             'modest.' But enough about you,

<b>GETTING CLOSER --
</b>

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN (O.S.)

             She was no crippled saint. Wasn't

             Doug's house all messed up.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>



Sheriff Ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw
Miranda. The gate still locked. She's not there. He
traces her steps, clearly enjoying this:




<b>                        SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
          Sure she was a minor, but she
          wasn't going to let that get in
          her way.




<b>INT. STORAGE AREA - SAME TIME
</b>
Miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk. The SHOT
is FRAMED so we can see the doorway. She prays silently:

<b>                        MIRANDA
</b>
                  (sotto)
          Rachel, where are you when I need
          you?
Clearly not here.   Sheriff Ryan's voice getting closer:

<b>                        SHERIFF RYAN (O.S.)
</b>
          Those other girls -- make no
          mistake -- they knew what they
          were getting into.
He appears at the doorway now, peeks inside the room.
Sensing her in there. Miranda holds her breath.

<b>                        SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
          I'm not saying they knew they were
          going to die, but truth is, Doug and
          I didn't know it was going to end that

          of that moment. So yeah, we fucked
          them and we killed them. And we knew
          it was wrong. Sure we did.
He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a
CLANGING SOUND. Miranda wasn't underneath that one. She
scrambles to the door behind him as he turns --







<b>INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
She slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to
slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly
SMASHES OPEN against her, knocking her backwards onto the
floor --
He looms over her. She reaches around for anything to
defend herself. Nothing there. Game over --

             It wasn't some satanic pact,
             society didn't make us do it. But
             I believe given the proper
             circumstances a person is capable
             of anything -- certainly in my
             line of work you see it day in,
             day out.
                      (beat)
             Tell you what, keep the shirt.
             The bra will do.
Miranda stares, helpless. The Sheriff gestures for her
to begin. Like he has all the time in the world.
Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra
under her shirt. Petrified --

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Chin up, Doctor. You wanted to
             get to the bottom of this and you
             did. You followed it all the way
             through. This is how it ends.
His demeanor and voice are eerily calm,    as if in a
trance. He takes the bra from her hand     and hangs it
around her neck, as if helping somebody    with their tie.
She takes a step back and finds herself    pinned against
the wall --

</b>
             Doug settled down once you two got
             married. New start and all that.
             Wanted nothing to do with this
             runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver --
He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking
her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole
body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking
uncontrollably --

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Or so he claimed. Because the
             truth, Doc -- is people never
             change. The son of a bitch
             couldn't resist. I asked him to
             dump the body and instead he went
             found some barn to work her out of
             his system some more. Go fucking
             figure.
And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so
slowly reach for his holster...

They're so close together their noses nearly touch. He
gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He
applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin
to the point of no return --

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             The only soul you can ever count
             on is yourself --
BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a
gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet,
dazed.
He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him.
Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on
his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.

<b>                            SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             Why, Doctor.   That was unexpected.
He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes
her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the
trigger --

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             You sure about this?
He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his
head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's
open cell, weighing his options at triple speed --

<b>                           SHERIFF RYAN
</b>
             You need me alive for your story
             to stick. Be logical now. You
             know you can't kill me.
He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills
a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays
backwards and lands with a crash.

</b>
             Logic is overrated.

we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake.

MOVING TOWARD him, we COME TO REST ON the back of his
neck. So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back
of his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold
whisper, they stand up on their ends.



Pete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now
open. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door.

Pete looks oddly around the room.

As he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room.
Unseen by him, of course. Pete starts to exit when Tracy
opens her eyes. Groggily waking as if from a dream.

Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of
take-out food. Chatting with his colleagues.

Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it.

<b>                             OFFICER TURLINGTON

             Sheriff Ryan?
No sight of the man.  That's odd. Maybe he's in the
bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction.

The FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete,
Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area.

          I'm sorry, but nobody is allowed

          You know full well you're not

Teddy Howard slaps an official-looking document on him.

</b>
          That's straight from Judge
          Wilkinson. Take us to her cell.

<b>                        FRONT DESK OFFICER
</b>
          Better get the Sheriff out here.
Turlington looks over the paperwork, confused.

<b>                        OFFICER TURLINGTON
</b>
          Sheriff Ryan isn't here. His car
          is gone too.

</b>
          Officer, unlock the goddamn door
          to Miranda's cell or I'll break it
          down myself.
Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way,
certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric
institutes. He leads the men down the corridor and
unlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are
dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open.
The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.

Sheriff Ryan, splayed.   Very dead.

Teddy Howard has to look away. Pete places his hand on
Parsons' shoulder. Parsons simply glares at the dead
man, eyes filled with hatred.
No sign of Miranda anywhere.        Vanished.   Like Houdini.

             Hey, you never know. It's a small

Chloe picks up her bag, climbs down the steps to her cab.
Stops midway, turns:

             You don't have to tell me if you

Pete shakes his head. Chloe nods, climbs inside the cab.
Pete waves as it drives off. Then he pulls out a postcard
from his pocket. It has a New York City postmark.

          Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on
          both feet, preferably having been
          promoted to director after Phil's
          retirement. Not that you had much
          competition, but a big hug to you
          anyway... I was as surprised as
          anyone to read about Sheriff
          Ryan's suicide and the startling
          discovery that it was he who
          murdered my late husband. I wish
          I could personally thank certain
          people for their convincing
          testimonies in the case.
