          Stephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is
          standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight
          on him. The rest of the stage is dark.
          Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter
          of factly.
<b>                          STEPHEN
</b>           I am neither Christian...nor
           atheist. I am not Jewish or
           Muslim. What I believe...my
           religion is called the
           constitution...
          A pause.
          Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct
          sound of feedback getting louder until it stops.
                         
          We hear the director speak over the loud speaker.
                         
<b>                          DIRECTOR
</b>           Hang on...let me open these up....
          We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who
          are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he
          stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS
<b>          ROUTINE.

          Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage.
          Stephen continues.

           your right to worship whatever god
           you believe in...
                         
          The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark. He
          keeps going.

</b>           Also we'll need these podiums put
           on a riser as we agreed to in the
           pre-conditions. You're a few
           inches short and it makes it harder
           for the Governor to read his notes.

           last night and they're building a

           is not a life choice but part of
           your DNA, then gay marriage is and

</b>           No Stephen. You didn't make a
           mistake. You made a choice. You
           called me and left a message to
           call back...that it was important.
           But when I did...you said to forget
           about it. You chose not to tell
           me. Why did you make that choice?
<b>                          STEPHEN
</b>           I didn't think it was important.
                         
<b>                          PAUL
</b>           Sure you did. But you went because
           you were curious, because you were
           flattered. Because it made you feel
           special to think Duffy wanted to
           speak to you instead of me. Because
           you thought to yourself: maybe I
           can get something out of this.
           Because it made you feel big.
           First campaign I ran tiny little
           race in Kentucky -state senate
           seat. Workin for redneck nobody
           named McGuthrie. Had no money, no
           staff, no fuckin office. Everyone
           thought we didn't stand a chance.
           There's no way we can compete. And
           about this time, a guy running a
           congressional campaign a few
           districts over gives me a call.
           Says, "I really like what you were
           able to do for poor ole' Sam. But
           let's face it, he's a goner, so why
           don't you come work for me?" What
           do I do? Well Stephen -this is
           where you and I are different. I
           told Sam about the call. And Sam
           says to me, "Paul, you think this
           other's guy's got a shot at
           winning, and he can pay you more
           than anything I can afford, so if
           it's what you feel you need to do,
           then I won't get in your way." So I
           say, "Sam -you took a chance and
           hired me when I was even more of
           nobody than you are, and I'd be
           damned if I'm gonna jump ship just
           because the shit hit the fan."
           We lost the race, but three years
           later, when Sam decided to run for
           Governor -who do you think he
           called? We won that race.

           our jobs with a heavy heart.
                         
          As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone
          vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of
          the caller. It reads "Molly." He looks up. Panic starts to
          set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and
          the phone vibrating.
          The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he
          scans around the room looking through the press corps up to
          the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen.
                         
          STEPHEN holds a cell phone to his ear. They stare at each
          other. Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops
          vibrating.
                         
          Stephen turns and leaves.

</b>           You always hear people talking
           about events out of sequence...the
           order of things. There is no
           greater grief than a parent laying
           their child to rest...She was a
           little girl trying to make it in a
           very grown up world...a world were
           every mistake is magnified and she
           was smart and pretty and so so
           young.

</b>           Father, you ask us to accept God's
           plan, to not question his judgment,
           with all due respect, I don't
           accept this judgment. She made the

          They all seem to be staring at him. They probably aren't -
          but he feels it. The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen
          has given over to emptiness. The price of winning at all
          cost.

<b>           GOV. MORRIS
</b>           Senator Thompson I am proud that
           you have brought integrity back to
           this election. Because that's what
           this comes down to, integrity. Who
           we are. Because how we project
           ourselves to the rest of the world
           matters!...Dignity
           matters!...Integrity matters!...Our
           future depends on it!
          Forty seconds - the silence is broken by the SOUND MAN.

           senior campaign advisor, Stephen
           Myers, coming to us from Xavier
           University where Senator Thompson
           has just endorsed Governor Morris,
           essentially ending this primary
           race. (To Stephen) Stephen, can
           you give us some insight into how
           this whole thing unfolded?
