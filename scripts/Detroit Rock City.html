<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               INT. MRS. BRUCE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Decorated in Carol Brady chic. When it's not gaudy, tacky, 
               and loud, it's blander than toast. Colors like lime green 
               and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only.

               MRS. BRUCE, late 30's, enters looking exhausted. She carries 
               a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, Erma 
               Bombeck's The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic Tank.

               HUMMING "We've Only Just Begun," Mrs. Bruce crouches next to 
               her wildly-ancient entertainment center complete with 8-track.  
               She flips the first record forward on her Ronco Record Mate. 
               Album after album flaps forward. Olivia Newton-John, Neil 
               Diamond, the Osmond Brothers. She stops on the Carpenters 
               and sighs at the serene cover art. Just what the doctor 
               ordered.

               Placing the vinyl on the turntable, she CLICKS the dustcover 
               closed and FLICKS "Play." Reclining in her Lazyboy, she sips 
               her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of Karen 
               Carpenter.

               Suddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun GUITAR.  
               Caustic ROCK 'N' ROLL assaults her senses. She jumps, spilling 
               her wine all over herself. This isn't the Carpenters...

<b>               IT'S KISS!
</b>
               Racing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume 
               control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand. The 
               music is even louder now.

               Flustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover.  
               It's stuck. She screams and covers her ears. This is Hell. 
               Running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to 
               reach the plug, but can't. Fingertips millimeters away.

               As the cacophony POUNDS she shakes the entire stereo with 
               all her frantic might.

               SCREEEEEECH! The needle scrapes across the vinyl with a 
               shrill, finally coming to a stop. Whew, silence!

               Then, POP, the dustcover opens unceremoniously. Shaken, she 
               grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label...

<b>                                KISS - LOVE GUN, SIDE TWO
</b>
               Mrs. Bruce's blood boils.

<b>                                     MRS. BRUCE
</b>                         KISS! The devil's music!

<b>               EXT. LEX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               A small, two-story house amid a suburban neighborhood of 
               other two-story houses. Uninspired architecture. Spindly 
               trees. 

               Two-car garage.

               A faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across 
               which shadows frantically dart. Over the CRICKETS, we hear 
<b>               MUFFLED, BADLY-RENDERED ROCK 'N' ROLL. SCRATCHY, GUTTURAL, 
</b>               inhuman.

               CAMERA MOVES to the cellar window. Inside we see four TEENAGE 
               BOYS who are to blame for the racket. Band practice.

<b>               INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               An inner-sanctum of KISS devotion. Faux-wood paneling is 
               plastered with countless KISS posters, pictures, fold-outs.  
               The ceiling is wallpapered with more KISS posters. KISS dolls, 
               magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag-carpeted 
               floor. Fast food wrappers heap over the KISS garbage pail.

               The four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast 
               a familiar tune offensively off-key.

<b>                                     BOYS SINGING
</b>                         "I wanna rock 'n' roll all night and 
                         party every day!"

               They stink, but they sure are trying hard. Meet the band 
               "Mystery." Concert tee-shirts, holey jeans, total burn-outs.

               HAWK, a scraggily-haired, disenchanted youth, strains his 
               vocal chords on the microphone as he SCRATCHES at his rhythm 
               guitar. Hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but 
               knowing the others, that doesn't say much.

               LEX POUNDS a bass with earnest determination. Lanky with bad 
               posture, Lex is already sporting worry lines. He takes 
               everything way-too-seriously.

               TRIP STRUMS lead guitar like he's hammering nails. All id, 
               Trip is slightly out of his mind. But, is it the chemicals 
               or just his chemistry. He always wears a knit cap.

               JAM, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), BASHES on his drums like 
               a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. 
               The big drum bears the word "Mystery" painted on its skin 
               with a lightning "S" just like the KISS logo.

               They bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and 
               thrust their hands over their heads in the KISS symbol.  
               Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         Thank you, Cleveland! You're a great 
                         crowd. But after three and a half 
                         hours of kick-ass rock and seven 
                         encores on top of that, I'm sorry to 
                         say that this time we really gotta 
                         get back to our hotel rooms and fuck 
                         some groupies.

               Behind him, Trip grabs Lex's bass and swings it by the neck 
               at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again. Lex 
               quickly yanks it away from him.

<b>                                     LEX
</b>                         What the fuck, Trip? That's my bass!

               Jam emerges from behind the pile of drums smiling.

                         in the world... KISS!!

               They all make that BREATH SOUND that mimics a screaming crowd.  
               Suddenly, headlights swing by in the window above them like 
               a spotlight. Lex hops onto the unmade bed and looks out the 
               cellar window.

<b>               LEX'S POV
</b>
               A baby-shit green, Ford station wagon with fake wood sides 
               SCREECHES into the driveway. Mrs. Bruce gets out and STOMPS 
               toward the house. Lex gasps at the sight.

<b>                                     LEX
</b>                         Shit! It's Jam's mom!

               Jam GULPS as if he's just shat out an whole can of Lincoln 
               logs.

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         My mom? Oh, no! What's she doing 
                         here?

               Lex quickly throws a KISS towel over a TV tray hiding a bong, 
               cigarettes, overloaded ashtray. Trip kicks half-empty beer 
               bottles under the bed. Hawk sprays Lysol frantically around 
               the room as Jam shovels gum into his mouth.

               KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! Mrs. Bruce pounds on the cellar window 
               crouching to see in. She looks like a crazed, underlit psycho.

                         Jeremiah! Jeremiah Bruce! You get 
                         out here this instant!

               The boys looks up like innocent, wide-eyed angels. Jam waves.

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         Oh, hi, mom.

<b>                         NOW!
</b>
               Jam quickly pockets his drumsticks and grabs his worn, denim 
               jacket off the pile of jackets on the floor, then runs 
               upstairs. The others follow.

<b>               EXT. LEX'S HOUSE/FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
</b>
               The front door opens. Jam steps out to greet his mom with a 
               nervous smile. Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand at a safe distance 
               in the foyer behind him.

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         What's up?

               Mrs. Bruce grabs her son by the ear and holds up the KISS 
               LOVE GUN record waving it in his face.

<b>                                     MRS. BRUCE

                         up! Don't you know what KISS stands 
                         for? "Knights in Satan's Service!"

               She hauls Jam across the lawn. Hawk, Lex, and Trip step onto 
               the porch looking on in sympathetic embarrassment. Mrs. Bruce 
               stuffs the record in the trash can then throws Jam in the 
               front seat. SCREECH, the station wagon pulls away.

</b>
               The sun's early morning rays beam through the KISS "Destroyer" 
               poster taped onto a window shade. The phone RINGS. Jam bolts 
               upright, his profile blocking the poster. He has just awakened 
               under the only other decoration in his room: a crucifix.

               Still dressed in last night's clothes, a plain black tee-
               shirt and blue jeans, Jam leaps out of bed unwittingly 
               planting a foot in the handle of a Bullworker (a piece of 
               exercise equipment comprised of a powerful spring with two 
               handles on either end) whose other handle is stuck under one 
               of the bed's legs.

               Jam runs to a phone on his dresser, drawing the Bullworker's 
               powerful springs out to maximum tension. No sooner does he 
               pick up, when he is yanked to the floor and dragged across 
               it as if tied to the bumper of a speeding car. Despite the 
               Bullworker pulling him back toward his bed, Jam does manage 
               to get the phone to his ear.

               The phone's cord stretches taut causing its cradle to leap 
               from the dresser and WHACK Jam on the head.

               Hawk is on the phone as Lex and Trip scour every inch of the

               Jam briefly scans his surroundings double-taking at the denim 
               jacket lying on the floor. He checks the pockets and sees

               Trip reaches in a breast pocket and pulls out Rosary beads.  
               Spooked, he drops them like they were a bug.

               Trip and Lex cease and desist the mom-bashing and continue 
               getting ready for school. Suddenly, Lex pushes Trip angrily.

               Jam gives the Bullworker one final yank. This time it comes 
               loose... not from his foot, but from under the bed. Its handle 
               lashes up SLAPPING him across the face. Ouch.

               Fully awake now, Jam throws on Trip's denim jacket. He stuffs 
               a drumstick into his left sock. We see "Mystery" written on 
               it. Just as he's about to stick the other one in his right 
               sock...

               Without a second of warning, or even a knock, Mrs. Bruce 
               suddenly ENTERS. Immediately Jam stands.

</b>                         Uhh... nothing.

               She turns to his closet, the door blocking her view of the 
               KISS poster. Jam leaps to the window and yanks the "Destroyer" 
               shade. It shoots up, FLAPPING around its rod. He's done this 
               before.

               Mrs. Bruce peeks at Jam from around his closet door. He 
               stretches in front of the window.

                         can see your penis.

               Jam reluctantly takes off the denim jacket as Mrs. Bruce 
               grabs the single drumstick from his hand and shakes it at 
               him.

               She pulls two Sears department store boxes from the closet 
               and lays them on the bed. Jam is visibly horrified.

               The suburban high school is teeming with morning activity.

               make up the popular crowd. There's DISCO DUDES, FRESHMEN who 
               look like grade schoolers, and GEEKS.

               At the smoking section hang the BURNOUTS. Hawk, Trip, and

               SLAM! They shut their lockers in unison.

<b>               INT. STUDY HALL - DAY
</b>
               The STUDY HALL TEACHER grades papers. On the wall a picture 
               of President Carter hangs next to Old Glory. The words "Be 
               Quiet" are written on the blackboard.

               Students study, read, doodle, sleep. Jam is at his desk 
               touching up the word "Mystery" on his drumstick. Next to him 
               sits BETH. Quirky, but cute, she stares longingly at him 
               wanting to say something, but not having the guts.

               Pleased with his work, Jam puts the drumsticks on the desk 
               and opens a Peter Criss album cover notebook depicting 
               countless doodles of the KISS logo, the Mystery logo, and 
               renderings of Peter Criss.

               Beth SIGHS and opens her own notebook. Drawings of hearts 
               fill the pages. In them is written "Beth + Jeremiah" and "I 
               love Jeremiah."

               Then, one of Jam's drumsticks rolls off the desk and onto 
               the floor. Beth quickly reaches down to grab it for him just 
               as he bends to get it too. THUD, they bash heads.

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         Oof!
                              (whispering)
                         Sorry.

               Rubbing her head, she smiles and hands him the drumstick.

<b>                                     BETH
</b>                         No problem.

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         Thanks.

               He stuffs his drumsticks in his socks pulling his pantlegs 
               down. Jam and Beth stare at each other. There's a mutual 
               crush, but both are apprehensive about making the first move. 
               Both want to speak, neither does. They awkwardly go back to 
               their notebooks.

               Mustering the nerve, Jam breaks the ice and whispers...

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         Beth?

               Beth spins too quickly. Her pen flies out of her hand.

<b>                                     BETH
</b>                         Yes?

               BOINK! The pen hits Jam in the eye.

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         Ow!

               Feeling awful, Beth moves in to help. The teacher looks up 
               sternly.

<b>                                     STUDY HALL TEACHER
</b>                         Mr. Bruce, Miss Bumsteen, is there a 
                         problem?

<b>                                     BETH
</b>                         No. No problem.

               Jam points to his eye.

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         Just a little pink eye. No reason to 
                         panic.

               Unamused, the teacher goes back to grading.

<b>                                     BETH
</b>                              (whispering)
                         Sorry.

</b>                              (handing back pen)
                         It's okay.

               Beth resumes doodling feeling like an idiot. Jam does too. 
               Ah, teenage awkwardness. Finally, Beth musters up some 
               courage.

<b>                                     BETH

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         Yeah?

               She hems and haw, then...

<b>                                     BETH

<b>                         I...
</b>
               Suddenly, Beth is rudely interrupted by HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK 
               coming from the P.A. The PRINCIPAL'S VOICE ECHOES over it.

<b>                                     PRINCIPAL'S VOICE

               Jam throws a startled glance to the speaker as the class 
               sings in unison.

               More FEEDBACK as the mike on the other end changes hands.

               All the kids except for Beth burst into hysterical laughter.

               Hawk sits at his lab table burning an eraser with his Bunsen

               other STUDENTS laugh till they hurt.

               Lex's eyes bug with terror. The basketball game is at a

               Trip dozes at his desk as an out-of-date film about VD 
               sputters on. The room is deafening with laughter. Then, as 
               if hit by a ton of bricks, Trip wakes up alarmed by the 
               familiar, shrilly voice.

               Jam slowly sinks in his chair under the profoundly humiliating 
               weight of an ENTIRE SCHOOL'S ECHOED LAUGHTER.

<b>               INT. WAITING AREA - DAY
</b>
               Mrs. Bruce sits next to a stand-up ashtray in the high 
               school's waiting area. Scowling, she fans the KISS tickets 
               out with one hand. Jam sits across from her, one leg jittering 
               anxiously.

               They sit for an uncomfortably long time until... Mrs. Bruce 
               pulls a cigarette and lighter out of her purse.

<b>                                     MRS. BRUCE

                         magazines and comic books are one 
                         thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, 
                         do you realize what this means? That 
                         you're no longer content merely 
                         hearing their awful songs or looking 
                         at photos of their horrific faces! 
                         Now you want to see the devil in the 
                         flesh. You want to reach out and 
                         touch pure evil... and in Detroit no 
                         less!

               She flicks the lighter, not yet lighting the cigarette.

                         even belong to me. They're for the 
                         guys.

               Mrs. Bruce holds the tickets over the lighter's flame.

<b>                                     MRS. BRUCE
</b>                         And if the "guys" have parents who 
                         truly love them, they will elevate 
                         me to sainthood for getting rid of 
                         these blasted things.

               Mrs. Bruce lights her smoke with the flaming tickets, then 
               drops them in the ashtray where they burn for a cruel 
               eternity. Jam stares semi-catatonic through his mom's sour 
               expression.

<b>                                     MRS. BRUCE

                         kind of discipline you deserve.

               She stands and pulls him out the front entrance by his arm.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex peek around it, their heads forming a

               Suddenly, a caustic voice BLURTS from down the hall.

               toothed, security officer with long sideburns and slicked 
               back hair at the far end of the hall, fists on his hips.

               Elvis laughs and breaks into a run barreling down on them 
               like a maniac. Keys JANGLING furiously.

               They take off in three different directions. Still laughing, 
               Elvis stops where the boys just were. Which one to follow? 
               He bolts after Hawk who has taken the nearest staircase.

               Beth looks sadly out the window watching Mrs. Bruce push Jam 
               in the car. Beth puts her hand on the pane wanting to touch 
               him.

               Meanwhile, Elvis HUFFS and PUFFS up a flight of stairs 
               arriving at a set of swinging doors. He goes to push one in, 
               but it swings out at him with a vengeance knocking him 
               backward.

               From behind it pops Hawk wielding a fire extinguisher. BLAST! 
               A hail of foam covers Elvis's face. Hawk shoves the 
               extinguisher into the man's arms and pushes Elvis backwards 
               down the stairs. He topples ass-over-head till he hits the 
               landing.

               Elvis rises and shakes the CO2 off like a wet dog. Looking 
               up, he sees the door gently swinging in and out. No sign of 
               Hawk.

               shoves him against the wall.

               into Trip and Lex as if a swarm of killer bees was out there.

               All three stand on the toilet bracing their arms against the 
               walls for balance.

               A FOXY GIRL hurries into the stall next to theirs. We see 
               the top halves of three heads peek over the stall's partition.

               they're standing on breaks into pieces with a SMASH. They 
               topple over pulling the stall walls down with them exposing

               They bolt out the door slipping and sliding across the torrent

               Except for the tinkering NOISES that are heard as the STUDENTS

               The teacher, MR. JOHANSEN, sips from a coffee cup and reads 
               a newspaper, his feet on the desk. The headline says: "Mass 
               Suicide in Jonestown. Cyanide in the Kool-Aid." Above him is 
               a long banner reading: "Sorry, Absolutely no bathroom breaks".

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex sit before a half-built radio on a work 
               bench, sheer desperation etched on their faces.

               Lex solders two copper wires together. Hawk attaches a dial. 
               Trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long 
               plastic tube. He blows air into his face repeatedly with it.

               Hawk turns the radio on and a HIGH FREQUENCY WHINE pours 
               from its speaker. He adjusts the volume, then the tuner, 
               until a DJ's VOICE comes through crisp and clear.

               back of his pants.

               The stain travels fast, hitting Trip's knee in a nanosecond.  
               In a state of shock, Mr. J. slowly opens a long forgotten 
               drawer on his desk, finding a cobweb and dust-covered pad of 
               bathroom passes. He tears one off and dust flies everywhere.

               He holds the pass out to Trip like it was a cross he was

               Hawk points across the cafeteria and sure enough Elvis has 
               just entered. Luckily, he hasn't noticed the boys yet.

               Elvis swaggers to a table of CHEERLEADERS, puts his leg on a 
               chair and starts a one-sided conversation with them. They 
               promptly push their trays away, having lost their appetites.

               Meanwhile, back at the condiment tray, Hawk and Trip each 
               grab a big handful of ketchup packets and head to a table. 
               Lex reluctantly follows suit grabbing a big handful of ketchup 
               packets too. All three of them put their trays down and sit.

               Hawk approaches the exit door, glances either way, then 
               leaves.

               Trip and Lex look at their watches for five seconds. Then 
               Trip heads for the exit door also.

               Lex still stares at his watch. After five, he looks at Elvis, 
               who stops talking to the cheerleaders. As if possessing some 
               sixth sense, Elvis turns quickly and looks STRAIGHT INTO

               Relieved he's gone, the cheerleaders start eating again.

               Elvis moves through the cafeteria in SLOW MOTION toward the 
               exit door. The hunter in action.

               Elvis pushes through the door and into a hall, dead-eye stare 
               focused up ahead where the hallway turns sharply. He catches 
               a glimpse of Lex. Smiling like the devil, Elvis bolts.

               Lex catches up with Hawk and Trip just as Elvis swings around

               chase ensues. Down hallways. Around corners. Upstairs. Down 
               ramps.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex scramble as fast as they can to escape 
               the clutches of their sideburn-clad nemesis.

               As the boys pass a classroom, a NERD comes out pushing a 
               projector on an AV cart. Thinking fast, Hawk grabs it out of 
               the nerd's hands and pushes it down the hall at Elvis.

               CRASH! Elvis bashes face-first into the rolling cart. He and 
               the projector go tumbling. Not wasting a second, Elvis is 
               back on his feet and after them again. The nerd grabs his 
               hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector.

               Elvis SKIDS around the corner and trips on a fire hose

               fountain pipe. He slides on his belly along the polished

               to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned.

               They start stomping on the packets, squirting Elvis's face 
               and torso with tomato-based condiment causing him to let out 
               a scream that lasts the rest of the scene. Ketchup spatters 
               across his body in SUPER SLOW MOTION. A shot hits him in the 
               mouth and he COUGHS it back out in mid-scream.

               The boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their 
               nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his arms 
               back, body quaking at every splat. It's kind of like the 
               scene in "The Godfather" where Sonny gets it.

               Beaten and spent, his scream now dried up to a hoarse GASPING, 
               Elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet. He hits the floor 
               with a THUD right in the goop. He lays there letting out DRY 
               SOBS looking like a bunless wiener.

               Hawk jumps off the stoop. Taking Elvis's key chain away, he 
               hops back up and unlocks the door letting Trip and Lex out. 
               Hawk whips the keys back at Elvis, hitting him in the head,

               in the muck again and fall back down twice as hard.

               Mrs. Bruce and FATHER McNULTY stand outside his office. The 
               door is open a tad. Jam sits just beyond it, but all we see 
               are his corduroyed legs which shake. Jam is one nervous kid.

               The priest enters, SLAMS the door shut, startling Jam, and 
               sits in front of a painting of the Virgin Mary on his wall. 
               The name plate on his desk reads: FR. PHILIP McNULTY.

</b>                         Before enrolling you, Jeremiah, let 
                         me just say it would be greatly 
                         appreciated if your career at St. 
                         Bernard's was an uneventful one. 
                         Some students believe they can get 
                         expelled through disobedience and 
                         recklessness. What they don't 
                         understand is even after God's 
                         vengeance is meted out, He forgives. 
                         That His devastating anger is followed 
                         by His nurturing compassion. In a 
                         nutshell, St. Bernard's may punish 
                         you even for the slightest digression, 
                         but will never cast you out, even 
                         for the largest. So here you are, 
                         Jeremiah... here to stay!

               Father McNulty sticks the pencil into an electric pencil 
               sharpener and it makes the same NOISE a DENTIST'S DRILL does 
               when burrowing into a molar. Jam shudders.

               The Father removes the pencil and blows the shavings away 
               from the needle-sharp tip.

               Mrs. Bruce exits the building and approaches her car. She 
               stops when she sees the '78 brown Volvo parked behind her. 
               It's empty. She shrugs and gets into her car, driving off.

               Inside the Volvo Hawk, Trip, and Lex poke their heads up. 
               The coast is clear so they can sit straight again. They stare 
               up at a second story window where they see part of Jam's

               They hear an ENGINE and turn to see a delivery truck labelled 
               PIZZA PIG parking behind them. A DELIVERY BOY holding a pizza 
               box steps out. Trip's mouth waters.

               Seeing the boys, the delivery boy stops at the Volvo.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex exchange an anxious glance, then Hawk 
               smiles. He is officially inspired as he turns to the boy.

               The Father TAPS his pencil looking impatiently at Jam who 
               has totally withdrawn. He sits motionless staring into space.

                         listen to them? Jeremiah?

               A NUN enters KNOCKING.

               The nun exits and a second later Hawk enters wearing Lex's 
               baseball cap pulled down over his eyes.

               The priest swivels his chair around and unlocks a box labelled 
               "Donations." While he looks for cash, Hawk gives Jam a 
               discreet kick in the shin. Jam looks up and recognizes Hawk. 
               He then looks out the window seeing Trip, Lex, and the Volvo 
               below.

               For the first time we see what Jam looks like with a big, 
               fat, shit-eating grin on his face.

               Father McNulty swivels back around with a ten.

               Hawk takes the ten, tips the brim of the baseball cap and 
               leaves, giving Jam a cautious wink as he goes.

<b>                                     FATHER MCNULTY

               Father McNulty raises his eyebrows, then opens the pizza 
               box.

                         barrier we've broken through.

               Father McNulty smiles, taking a big bite. Jam smiles for an 
               entirely different reason. The priest mumbles with a mouthful.

               Father McNulty GAGS sticking his pizza-covered tongue out.

               concerned for the moment. Finally, he BELCHES.

               laugh a man can without risking psychological evaluation.

               Jam watches fascinated as the priest tries to finish the 
               story. It's not every day you see a holy man tripping on 
               shrooms.

                         So then, the younger one says, "But

               Father McNulty belly laughs so hard this time, he slides off 
               his chair hitting his chin on the edge of his desk. He is in 
               pain only momentarily, then laughs again, this time at his 
               own pratfall. He hoists himself back into his chair.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex suddenly barge into the office, followed

               He lets out a belly laugh as the shocked nun runs from the

               POUNDING his fists on the desk, tears rolling down his cheeks, 
               until...

               He suddenly glimpses at the painting of the Virgin Mary and

               The boys do their Three Stooges handshake and say "Curly!"

               Jam starts to change. Just then, the Volvo passes a two-tone 
               Chevy Impala with luggage tied to the roof. The passenger in 
               the back seat turns and spots Jam pulling off his pants. 
               It's Beth. Her eyes bulge. Beth parents are in the front.

               Jam spots her and beams. Their eyes lock. She waves and starts 
               to yell something, when... suddenly... BANG!

               The boys look out the driver's side of the car to see the 
               rear hubcap rolling away. They've got a flat.

               The boys chomp on their pizza slices and chug cans of Hawaiian 
               Punch. Another raucous KISS tune BLARES.

               Behind them, a car horn starts HONKING rhythmically. Hawk 
               looks into the rearview mirror and sees two guys and two 
               girls in a tailgating Trans Am.

               The guys have 90 M.P.H. haircuts, tacky, wide-collared shirts, 
               and massive amounts of jewelry on their necks.

               The girls wear 10-layer make-up, mega-jewelry, and hair teased 
               so high, it touches the car's roof.

               The speakers BLAST a DISCO SONG to which the four passengers 
               sing. KENNY, the driver, HONKS to the disco beat.

               They're slightly older than our heroes and very full of 
               themselves. Kenny and his best girl CHRISTINE sit in the 
               front. BOBBY and BARBARA are in the back. It's a double disco

               Just as the DISCO TUNE playing in the Trans Am hits the next 
               chorus, a fistful of pizza SPLATTERS across the windshield. 
               Freaked, Kenny swerves and zigzags all over the road.

               Righting himself, Kenny's entire family might as well have

               He turns off the stereo and floors the accelerator, swerving 
               into the left lane and passing the Volvo. Bobby is just now 
               noticing the mess on the windshield.

               The Trans Am runs alongside the Volvo and Hawk turns to see

               Parking the ass end of the Pontiac out a bit, Kenny blocks 
               the Volvo in. Kenny and Bobby climb from their car and storm

               Hawk opens his door just as Kenny's hairy-knuckled hands 
               pull him out through the window. He grabs Trip, yanking him 
               out too. Bobby opens the back door and does the same with 
               Lex and Jam.

               With a kid in each hand now, Kenny and Bobby SLAM the four 
               boys against the Volvo in a line. The size difference between 
               the burnouts and the guidos is painfully obvious now. Kenny

                         clean the friggin' windshield. I 
                         insist.

               And with that, Kenny grabs himself a fistful of Hawk's long 
               hair and pulls him over to the Trans Am. He wipes the pizza 
               off with Hawk's hair, tugging Hawk's head up and down, back 
               and forth. Hawk GRUNTS with each wipe, but doesn't give Kenny 
               the satisfaction of hearing him scream.

               Trip, Lex, and Jam watch helplessly, trapped under Bobby's 
               dull-witted, but equally threatening gaze.

               Kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and 
               looks at his handiwork.

               He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby. Then, he 
               suddenly hears the KISS tune coming from the Volvo. Uh-oh!

<b>                                     KENNY
</b>                         Oh, no, no, no! It's the fag band!

               Kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo, reaching 
               in the driver's door. Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist.

<b>                                     JAM
</b>                         Whoa! This is about pizza! Let's 
                         leave KISS out of it. Please.

                         These assholes must be stopped!

               Kenny pushes Jam away.

</b>                         That's it, Kenny! I'm leaving!

               Christine gets out of the car and starts walking down the 
               highway, exiting the scene.

<b>                                     BARBARA
</b>                         Oh, Christine! You googatz in the

                              (to Kenny)
                         Right, Kenny?

               Kenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo.

                         music.

               Kenny takes the 8-track from the car...

</b>                         But this... is crap!

               He flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed 
               to bits under the wheels of a passing semi.

               FOLLOW a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape 
               streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the 
               road, landing at Jam's feet.

               TILT UP to Jam's face. He raises his eyes and turns to the 
               CAMERA, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the 
               Indian in that "Keep America Beautiful" litter ad.

               Hawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him.

                         done, I believe we are ready for the 
                         final topic of discussion. Namely: 
                         Have you learned your lesson yet, 
                         puke?

               Hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. He 
               blows some smoke in Kenny's face.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         Well, let's recap, shall we? You 
                         slapped all of us, yelled at me, 
                         used my head for a rag, threw me on 
                         the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8-
                         track under the wheels of a passing 
                         semi.
                              (puffing on cig)
                         So, if the lesson was that you're a 
                         dick with ears and a really bad 
                         haircut, then, yes... I'd say we 
                         learned it.

</b>                         Oh, yeah...?

               Out of original material, Kenny goes for an old stand by.

<b>                                     KENNY
</b>                         That's not what your mother said 
                         last night.

               Trip, Lex, and Jam exchange "uh-oh" glances. Meanwhile, Hawk's 
               eyes glaze over.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me...

               Hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly 
               empty can of Hawaiian Punch, holding it discreetly at his 
               side.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         ...what exactly did my mother say 
                         last night?

               Kenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         You heard me, prick. What did my 
                         mother say last night?

               Kenny chuckles and looks at Bobby. They have a good little 
               laugh... the homo's got balls! Then Kenny turns back to Hawk.

<b>                                     KENNY
</b>                         Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what 
                         your mother said last night.
                              (beat)
                         She said that I was the fuck of her 
                         life.

               Hawk is a little mad now. He tosses his cigarette to the 
               ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                              (very Clint Eastwood)
                         How would you like a nice Hawaiian 
                         Punch?

<b>                                     KENNY
</b>                              (smirking)
                         Sure.

               Quick as a shot, Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into Kenny's 
               nose, crushing it flat against his face. Hawaiian backwash 
               spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards 
               from the impact. He hits his head on the ground.

               Taking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a 
               chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out his 
               drumsticks.

               As if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet, 
               snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Lex 
               THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle leaving 
               a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead.

               Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet. When he 
               hits the ground, Jam's right there DRUMMING his balls.

               Bobby shrieks.

               Meanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can 
               off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose 
               with fruit punch for snot.

               Hawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes 
               the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets out 
               a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity.

               Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head 
               swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground, 
               unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking 
               Bobby out cold.

               Terrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered.

               Kenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with 
               Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. 
               Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of 
               Barbara's shoulders.

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the 
               stella, snickering.

                         they do, they're gonna kick your

               Hawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road, walking 
               up to the Trans Am.

                         But let's really make it worth their 
                         while.

               Hawk puts the rock on the Trans Am's accelerator letting the 
               engine WHINE in protest. (Again we are cautious not to show 
               the guidos' faces.)

                         you give him a message for me. Tell 
                         him, quote, Kool and the gang bite 
                         my bag, motherfucker, unquote.

               He throws the Trans Am into drive.

               All who are conscience listen to the brief SCREECH, then 
               watch the Trans Am as it barrels without a driver into the 
               woods skirting the highway.

               It races into ditches, bounces off trees, and SPLASHES through 
               ponds, all Smokey and the Bandit-like.

               The disco-mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles 
               down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way, 
               and finally, BOOM! It explodes on final impact.

               The boys all look at each other and shrug. Hawk walks back 
               to the Volvo and gets in. Trip, Lex, and Jam follow suit and 
               pile in as well. Lex shouts back to Barbara.

                         and I'll never mention it again.

               Hawk slows down, turning into the breakdown lane, travelling 
               about two miles per hour. Christine doesn't notice as they 
               edge closer to her.

               Hawk looks in the rearview mirror at Christine checking 
               herself in a compact. She swathes on some 7-Up flavored, 
               Bonnie Bell lip gloss.

               Trip meanwhile twirls the joint he's just finished rolling 
               in his mouth, sealing it. He winks at her disgustingly.

               Christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic and the 
               whole car gets a great laugh for a while.

               COBO HALL, where thousands of fans in KISS tees gather,

               COBO Hall looms up ahead.

               Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam enter the sidewalk. A thickening 
               CROWD of KISS fans continually meander by.

               On their way to the car, they suddenly hear a WOMAN'S VOICE 
               bellowing through a megaphone from somewhere down the street.  
               After a moment they see the voice's source.

               A GROUP OF WOMEN has congregated about forty feet ahead and 
               their LEADER, her back toward the boys, yells to the group 
               through her bullhorn. Flying above them all is a large banner 
               reading: "MATMOK, Mothers Against The Music Of KISS."

               The group cheers as the KISS FANS milling around them pretty 
               much ignore the whole MATMOK spectacle.

               Lex looks away from the MATMOKS and into the street. We can't 
               see what he sees, but we can tell he's alarmed.

                         We're running out of time here. This 
                         is KISS! A victory for one is a

                         barter with a scalper, but if you

                         Dudes? Later.

               Hawk, Trip, and Lex split up, leaving Jam alone. He starts 
               walking in the opposite direction, passing MATMOKS. The leader 
               is still on a roll, yelling through the megaphone.

                         Look at all the young faces! They 
                         smile and laugh but their eyes have 
                         lost all hope! Not one among them 
                         appears to possess the love and fear 
                         of God... This satanic group KISS 
                         has stolen their souls.

               The leader's gaze finally falls upon Jam. He lets out a GASP. 
               Yes, the leader is Mrs. Bruce. So this was her church meeting.

               She freezes when she sees her son; her jaw slackens. Meanwhile 
               Jam looks stunned beyond comprehension.

               Mrs. Bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another MATMOK 
               member, who picks up where Mrs. Bruce left off.

               Jam looks around for someplace to run and hide, but it's too 
               late. Mrs. Bruce slices through the crowd of KISS fans and 
               grabs Jam by the ear. He yelps.

               Mrs. Bruce tugs Jam toward the intersection we saw before.  
               They cross the street toward the corner where the Cathedral 
               sits.

               Jam looks up at the cross on the steeple and GULPS with 
               trepidation.

               They climb the steps to the cathedral passing a bulletin 
               board reading: Thank God It's Friday Mass, 6PM-7PM.

               PARISHIONERS exit the beautiful church, shaking hands with a 
               PRIEST as they leave.

               him stands the marquee for IT'S RAINING MEN, the male strip 
               joint. A DISCO SONG comes from inside. Just when it looks 
               like Hawk's given up, a VOICE is heard above.

               dances on a lighted, tile stage under a spinning, mirror 
               ball.

               Hawk shows the MAN AT THE DOOR his fake license and the man 
               nods him in. He approaches the bar in the early stages of 
               being very intimidated.

               The BARTENDER, a man dressed only in tight, black, tuxedo 
               pants, shirt cuffs, and a tie, comes up to Hawk.

               The bartender gives Hawk the once over.

               Hawk squints at a name tag on the bartender's tie.

               Dickey goes to the bottle rack on the other side of the bar.

                         get tonight.

               Dickey returns with the drink and Hawk pulls out his money 
               clip.

                         on the rocks before?

               Hawk looks at the unfamiliar drink again trying to play it 
               cool.

                         love.

               Dickey points to a WOMAN sitting at the end of the bar. Mature 
               and sexy. She's a knock-out. Every teenage boy's fantasy. 
               Hawk's eyes pop at this "Mrs. Robinson" before him.

                         Play your cards right and you could

                         it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman

                         her own head games.

               Dicky pats Hawk's shoulder and leaves. Hawk looks away from 
               Amanda and scans the room. He glances back at Amanda. She's 
               still gazing at him the way queens of yore must have eyed 
               particularly cute knights. She winks and toasts Hawk.

               Hawk raises his glass smiling nervously. They both sip at 
               their drinks. She licks her lips suggestively at him. And, 
               Hawk proceeds to COUGH up his mouthful of Jack Daniels, 
               SPRAYING it all over the bar.

               Your typical 70's convenient store. Out front two SIX YEAR

               Armstrong doll.

               Trip stomps over grabbing them by their mini shirts. When he 
               tries to act tough, it's pathetic. Even six year olds aren't

                         this instead. Now scram.

               The kids run away.

<b>               INT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT
</b>
               The store is crawling with KISS FANS, some reading the comic 
               books, others playing pinball against a far wall, still others 
               looking at the poster section. Trip enters on a mission.

               He looks around catching the eye of a pretty CASHIER. She's 
               a rocker, wearing a Who tee-shirt, a mood ring, and just a 
               little too much make-up. She smiles at him. Trip returns the 
               smile with a feeble wave. Her mood ring turns from blue to 
               pink.

               Concentrating on the layout of the store, Trip peers all the 
               way to the back to a darkened corner... where he spies a 
               LITTLE KID wearing a KISS tee-shirt playing a KISS pinball 
               machine.

               Trip smiles. The eagle has spotted a fuzzy, little bunny. He 
               moves in for the kill, walking past a crowd of kids at the 
               magazine rack, past the Hostess aisle, past the dairy cooler 
               and into the darkened corner.

               He stands behind the little kid, relishing this moment. The 
               kid is actually pretty good. We also see now the little kid 
               has his face painted like Ace Frehley.

               Suddenly distracted, the kid loses the ball.

                         you...

               Trip clamps a hand over the little kid's mouth.

                         your life.

               The little kid says something but Trip's hand muffles his 
               words.

               The kid says what he said before, but it is utterly 
               incomprehensible, once again thanks to Trip's hand.

               The kid turns and yells into the store before Trip can stop 
               him.

               A titanic guy at the comic book rack looks up from his issue 
               of "Thing" when he hears his name. CHONGO has a very low

               Chongo and his two buds laugh. Then, without a second of 
               warning, Chongo belts Trip in the gut. Trip doubles over and

               The little kid taps his finger on his chin and the theme 
               from "JEOPARDY" begins. While the kid thinks, Trip looks 
               nervously up at Chongo and his buds. Chongo reaches into his 
               denim vest pocket and we hear a CRINKLING NOISE. He comes 
               back up with two walnuts, putting them between his bicep and 
               forearm.

               Trip watches in horror as Chongo makes a muscle and the 
               walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron-hard flesh. 
               CREEEAAAACK! Chongo eats the walnuts, shells and all.

               Lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot 
               and looks at the back side of Cobo Hall just beyond the chain 
               link fence that surrounds the lot.

               He crouches down and walks between two cars parked against 
               the fence, looking both ways. Seeing a guard's flashlight 
               beam, he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past, then

               happens to be poorly lit.

               Spooked, he lays down again intending to slide back through 
               when a flashlight beam hits his eyes.

               Lex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the 
               other side of the fence. Panicking, he bolts deeper into the 
               field.

               Lex double-times it as we hear the guard yelling into his 
               walkie-talkie.

               The field gets darker as Lex closes in on Cobo Hall's well-
               lit loading dock, where ROADIES empty the remaining bits of 
               KISS's monstrous set from an 18-wheeler. Other huge trucks 
               are parked nearby. There's a bustle of last minute activity.

               Lex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to 
               huge trunks, keeping well hidden. He dodges roadies and avoids 
               being seen by OTHER GUARDS.

               He slithers along side the 18-wheeler and nears the loading 
               bay. Up ahead some auxiliary speakers, drum kits, and 
               scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building.

               Lex spins. The security guard, flanked by two others, barrel 
               right for him.

               He dives rolls under the 18-wheeler. The three security guards 
               leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him.

<b>               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEMI

               The three guards scramble to their feet and grab a SCRAWNY 
               BODY. They spin him around roughly.

<b>                                     SECURITY GUARD

                         here!

               They suddenly realize they've got the wrong man. It's a 
               roadie.

<b>                                     ROADIE

               The roadie holds up his all-access laminate angrily.

                         fuckin' apes.

               The security guards look around frantically for Lex as other 
               roadies join in to defend their comrade.

               No one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the 
               guards and up the loading dock ramp. They don't notice Lex 
               crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master.

               Praying he won't be spotted, Lex holds his breath as he's 
               carried into the building and disappears.

<b>               INT. ST. SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

               Jam sits in the front pew, head buried in his hands as Mrs. 
               Bruce and the priest talk on the alter.

               Beth moves quietly in the back, unseen and unheard. She looks 
               overwhelmed by the architecture, the detail on the stained 
               glass windows, the icons carved into the columns that support 
               the extravagantly decorated ceiling.

               The priest catches a glimpse of Beth meandering in the back.

                         morning, young lady. Run along now.

               Beth smiles nervously and heads back toward the front door 
               passing a confessional booth. She throws a glance back at 
               the priest and Mrs. Bruce who have returned to conferring, 
               their backs to her. She stealthily ducks into the booth.

<b>                                     MRS. BRUCE
</b>                         Now it's been a while since my boy 
                         had holy confession. Could you...?

</b>                              (smiling)
                         Consider it done.

               Mrs. Bruce looks down at Jam and sees his drumsticks poking 
               out of his socks. She immediately takes them out and stuffs 
               them into her jacket. Jam doesn't even move.

<b>                                     MRS. BRUCE

                         son of mine is going to be a career 
                         musician.

               Jam is stung. Mrs. Bruce and the priest head back down the 
               center aisle exiting through the gigantic front doors. She 
               eyes Jam.

<b>                                     MRS. BRUCE

                         care of some unfinished business.

               He lets her out and locks the door, leaving the keys in the 
               lock, and walks over to Jam.

</b>                         Come along, son. Get into the booth.

               He helps the despondent Jam up. They walk to the booth and 
               Jam reluctantly gets inside.

<b>               INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT

               Jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him, Beth 
               sits on a bench shrouded in darkness. Her posture is that of 
               someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap.

               We hear the SHUFFLING noise of the priest getting into his 
               own compartment next door. A moment later the small, eye-
               level door SLIDES open. The priest's face is barely visible 
               on the other side of the thick screen, but he's there.

               Beth leans forward slightly and listens to Jam's confession.

<b>               INT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               Hawk's at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from a 
               rocks glass. Four more empty rocks glasses sit in front of 
               him. He stares at the sexy woman who smiles back, blowing 
               him kisses from the other side of the bar.

               The EMCEE enters the stage.

                         Here comes our next amateur. Let's 
                         have a big hand for Hawk!

               The beginning of a rockin' KISS tune comes over the P.A. and 
               Dicky approaches Hawk.

<b>                                     EMCEE
</b>                         You're up, Hawk.

               Hawk wakes up fast. There's nothing more sobering than having 
               to undress in public.

<b>                                     HAWK

                         song playing and everything.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         I-I c-can't...

<b>                                     BARTENDER
</b>                              (leans in close)
                         Look, people undress in public 
                         because, A, they're exhibitionists, 
                         B, they're nutcases, or C, they need 
                         the money. I can tell you're not A, 
                         and I hope to hell you're not B. So 
                         my suggestion is, think about why 
                         you're a C and let your body party, 
                         shake your groove thing, boogie oogie 
                         oogie till you just can't boogie no 
                         more.

               Hawk thinks about it, then downs the rest of his drink. He 
               grimaces at it's taste, then opens his eyes with new resolve.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         You're right, Dicky. I gotta do it 
                         for KISS. Gotta put a bag over its 
                         head and 
                              (hiccup)
                         Do it for KISS.

               Hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off, 
               forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor. He proceeds 
               to fall flat on his face. Dicky looks down concerned, but 
               Hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage. 
               The crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks 
               him out as he walks by. They seem to like what they see. 
               Hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his 
               package first, his ass after. What the hell is he doing?

               Hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start 
               CLAPPING to the song. He faces them and starts gyrating his 
               drunken hips at them, feeling no confidence whatsoever, 
               until...

               The CHEERS start to ECHO and the pulsing lights begin to 
               hurt his eyes. Hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster 
               than the disco ball above his head.

               He stops gyrating and clutches his stomach. BELCHING. Uh-oh.

               Hawk spots an almost-empty beer pitcher one of the CHEERING-
               IN-SLOW-MOTION women holds above her head. He runs up to the 
               edge of the stage, grabs the pitcher, and PUKES.

               The cheering and music come to a grinding halt. You can hear 
               a pin drop as Hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher. 
               It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, then finally 
               stops.

               Hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at 
               him. He wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his 
               face.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         Wow. I feel a hundred times better!

               He hands the vomit-filled pitcher back to the shocked woman.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         Thanks lady.

               He looks over at the emcee, who gazes at Hawk from the DJ 
               booth.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         Maestro? As you were.

               The emcee stands perfectly still, jaw agape.

<b>                                     HAWK
</b>                         Come on, dude, we got a bunch of 
                         frisky felines waiting for some 
                         entertainment! The show must go on!

               Hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off. The 
               emcee shrugs, re-cuing the song. It starts again as Hawk 
               faces the crowd, dancing with new-found bravado.

               The women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly 
               start CLAPPING again.

               Hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head Roger 
               Daltry style. Then he pulls it back down and tosses it into 
               the crowd. The women actually fight over it.

               Encouraged, Hawk then peels off his KISS Army tee-shirt and 
               hurls it at the women, who SQUEAL with delight. Sure, he may 
               be scrawny, but they don't mind. This lad's got personality.

               Adrenaline pumping, confidence building, Hawk starts playing 
               the crowd of very responsive ladies.

               He unbuttons his jeans first. Then, leaving them on, he does 
               an "air guitar" medley: Chuck Berry, ZZ Top, Angus Young 
               from AC/DC, and Elvis Costello in six easy steps.

               Hawk finishes off with a Pete Townshend windmill, shaking 
               his ass at his audience in mid-strum, then licks his finger 
               and touches one of his cheeks: "hot stuff" (he does this in 
               a manly way of course).

               Then Hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear 
               bunching up in his crack.

               The women WHOO-HOO.

               He segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the ladies go 
               ga-ga. He makes the sign of the horns with each hand and 
               wiggles a protruding tongue like Gene Simmons. The gals scream 
               in orgastic joy.

               Then, Hawk goes for the gold. Yes, he does the Fonzie dance! 
               The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust. Hawk's 
               whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat. 
               Amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw 
               suggestively.

               At long last Hawk figures he has to give them what they want.

               He puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips. His 
               Brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs 
               sticking down from some KISS boxer shorts. The ladies go 
               batty.

               Unfortunately Hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing. 
               Never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off 
               first. He tries to kick off his shoes. The left one goes 
               flying across the bar and THWACK, beans a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN 
               in the face. She flies backwards over a chair.

               Trying to kick the other shoe off, Hawk loses his balance 
               and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the 
               bar.

               Two roadies carry the base drum down a long ramp unaware 
               that Lex is hidden inside.

               Suddenly, Roadie #2 snags his foot on a mess of cable and 
               loses his balance, dropping the oversized drum. In an instant 
               the drum goes rolling down the ramp quickly gaining speed.

               The roadies bolt after the runaway drum. Other workers scurry 
               out of the way to avoid being hit by the speeding instrument.

               More techies jump out of the way as the wayward drum heads 
               right for a closed set of double doors. The roadies are just 
               about to grab it before impact, when...

               The door unexpectedly swings open. The FOXY GROUPIES on the

               straight for them.

               Too late. The groupies jump away as the drum flies through 
               the open door and down a flight of stairs.

               The drum bounces down the zigzag stairway violently. Lex's

               The big drum hits the landing hard, tips over, then spins 
               like a quarter getting faster before it stops.

               They barrel down the stairs two at a time. Finally reaching

               empty. Once the roadies are gone, CAMERA TILTS UP to the

                         something a little juicier to confess 
                         than losing KISS tickets. I realize

                         find, what that rock and roll band 
                         is all about, to be boring as 
                         Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a

               in darkness, but can make out the time on his watch. It's 
               getting late. He resignedly sits on the bench behind him... 
               right on Beth's lap.

               Jam yells, but Beth throws her hand over his mouth. His eyes 
               bulge. He can't believe what he's seeing. He climbs off Beth 
               and sits next to her.

               recorded history. She pulls away finally wiping her mouth.

               leave his and begin to explore his chin, neck, ear.

               He starts hearing voices in his head. We see SUPERS of his 
               friends' faces hovering around him.

</b>                         I can't believe you're even thinking 
                         of committing a robbery, Trip. You 
                         don't pass go and collect 200 dollars 
                         for pulling stuff like this.

</b>                         No shit, dude, is this really worth 
                         it? Sure you get your ass kicked 
                         nine ways to Sunday by that fucking 
                         gorilla, but it's still a hundred 
                         times better than getting it porked 
                         for the next three to five.

               Trip sends brief, agitated glances around the store meeting 
               the cashier's eyes again. She smiles at him coyly as she 
               plays with her mood ring. He gives her the eye, then returns 
               to his comic.

                         never forget this night. Even if you 
                         get away with it, she'll be scarred 
                         for life. When are you gonna realize 
                         sometimes being tough means being 
                         tender.

                         Alright, everybody, SHUT UP!

               Trip snaps out of it. All the shoppers and cashier are 
               starring at him. He COUGHS loudly, clearing his throat to 
               cover his outburst. The shoppers go back to shopping.

               A MAN WITH A LONG COAT enters the store, looks around, then 
               takes a spot alongside Trip and opens a Mad Magazine.

<b>                                     TRIP

                         Okay, bro. You gonna have to do this 
                         sometime. Might as well be now.

               Trip puts a hand in his pocket and takes one last look at 
               Stretch Armstrong before stuffing the action figure back in 
               so it looks like he's got a gun. He takes three deep breaths 
               and discreetly pulls his knit cap down over his eyes, 
               revealing it actually as a semi-ski mask that covers the top 
               half of his face.

               Just then, the man with the coat puts the magazine back and 
               pulls something over his own head.

               Trip whirls around pointing Stretch-in-his-pocket at the 
               cashier...

               Just as the man in the coat, now masked with a stocking, 
               pulls the biggest shotgun ever made from under his coat, 
               pointing it at the cashier as well. The cashier shrieks. So 
               does Trip.

                         do, so do it quick.

                         yourselves to the floor and kiss it 
                         hello.

               His thunder now stolen, Trip drops to the floor along with 
               everyone else. The air is very tense. The cashier starts 
               SOBBING, keeping her hands in the air.

               Man with the coat COCKS the chamber and the cashier 
               immediately opens the register drawer and starts emptying 
               it.

                         wage!

               The man with the coat's laughter ECHOES in Trip's head till 
               he just can't take it anymore.

<b>               ON THE CASHIER
</b>
               She suddenly shoots a surprise glance over the man with the 
               coat's shoulder.

               Seeing this, the man spins around. There's Trip behind him.

               Astounded by Trip's audacity, the man with the coat turns 
               his shotgun point-blank at Trip.

               Your wildest fantasy of a rock show's backstage area come 
               true. The place is packed with "beautiful" people. Scantily-
               clad BABES everywhere. Slick, RECORD BIZ-TYPES. Lots of food. 
               Lots of booze. Lots of fun. It's backstage at a KISS concert, 
               come on!

               CAMERA TILTS UP above the partying hordes to find Lex shimming 
               along an exposed duct amid the pipes, sprinklers, and vents. 
               Looking straight down on everybody, Lex is in awe and 
               disbelief.

<b>                                     LEX

                         circle!

               He takes the opportunity to peer down some BIG BUSTED GIRL'S 
               cleavage. Then his eye spots something else. He GASPS. A 
               door. On it a star. Written on the star, the word, KISS.

<b>                                     LEX
</b>                         Oh, God, they're in there!

               A big-haired HIPSTER in mirrored sunglasses KNOCKS on the 
               dressing room door. It opens, but Lex can't see inside. The 
               hipster stands in the doorway talking to whoever is there.

               Lex cranes his neck to see around the door jamb. Desperate 
               for a glimpse of his idols, he leans out too far.

               Suddenly, the entire duct collapses. Breaking loose of the 
               ceiling, Lex hurls to the floor clutching the duct. Backstage 
               goers leap for cover as SMASH... he hits the ground in a 
               shower of plaster and dust.

               The hipster protectively pulls the dressing room door shut 
               as two SECURITY MEN jump in front of it.

               Instantly, huge, burly hands come down on Lex's shoulders.  
               Before he can react, a slew of OFFICERS have him off his 
               feet and carry him away, a stunned expression frozen to his 
               face.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND COBO HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               Lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff 
               of his neck. The security officers laugh and pat themselves 
               on the back as they hurry back in.

               Lex peeks out the lid. The alley is dark and spooky. He jumps 
               out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest 
               GERMAN SHEPHERD that has ever lived. Its teeth are bared and 
               its black, wolf-like body is coiled, ready to spring.  
<b>               GRRRRRRR!
</b>
               Lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster. A GROWLING PITBULL 
               walks out from the shadows and joins the Shepherd.

               Then, a GROWLING DOBERMAN with a spiked collar emerges from 
               the darkness on the other side of the alley, its solid, 
               muscular form making the brick building nearby look like 
               jello.

               Lex starts SLAPPING himself on the face.

                         part's gotta be a nightmare!

               No luck. He stops, when several other DOGS emerge from the 
               shadows and gather behind the first three. These new mutts 
               immediately join in the GROWLING chorale. The Shepherd snaps 
               at Lex.

                         so freaky in school today. I thought

                         out.

               Jam opens the box and his jaw drops. It's a black tee-shirt

                         shirts all the time. You look like a

                         were in Roman numerals. So I got you

               Touched, Jam kisses her for a long time. He starts putting

                         two weeks ago I went to my cousin's

               Still trapped by the GROWLING, BARKING pack of dogs, Lex 
               searches nervously through the garbage behind him.

                         ah-ha.

               Lex holds up a worn-out, old frisbee.

               The pack just glares and SNARLS. He tosses the frisbee over 
               the packs' heads, but the dogs don't even acknowledge it. 
               They just keep BARKING and GROWLING.

               Meanwhile, an unnoticed dog at the rear of the pack, a mangy 
               Basset Hound, turns its flat head to see the frisbee land on 
               the ground behind him. His tail starts to wag.

                         forthwith defer my destiny to you 
                         mutts. I may be an intelligent,

                         did all I could. It's up to you.

               Lex waits before the GROWLING, SNAPPING canines. Suddenly, 
               the Basset Hound runs up in front of the pack and drops the 
               frisbee at Lex's feet. Lex looks down at the floppy, wrinkly 
               dog, who wags its tail and PANTS furiously.

               Lex starts to pet the hound, and one-by-one the rest of the 
               dogs shut-up. Shocked, Lex picks the frisbee up again and 
               throws it.

               This time the entire pack bolts after the Whammo product.

               Lex smiles, watching them fight for it in the air... in SLOW 
               MOTION... as the theme from "CHARIOTS OF FIRE" begins.

               The black Shepherd finally grabs the frisbee in its mouth 
               and runs back toward Lex. It's soon joined by the rest of 
               the pack. That's right about when Lex realizes they aren't 
               going to stop.

               The dogs plow into Lex full-force knocking him into the 
               garbage. They surround him licking his face. Lex bursts into 
               unstoppable laughter.

               Pulling himself up, he pets the dogs as they jump around him 
               wagging their tails and PANTING.

               Lex stops. He hears TALKING coming from inside the windowless, 
               brick building on the other side of the alley. He steps in 
               front of the pack and puts his fingers to his lips. They 
               obey, quieting instantly. He then tiptoes to a thin crack in 
               the brick wall. The dogs quietly follow.

               Lex puts his eye to the crack and peers in.

               Two BEEFY JERKS with blow torches stand next to the cars. 
               One has a bandage on his head and seems to be in pain.

                         the future. Just wanted to thank you

                         tying the knot with a guy who didn't

                         cut down on the red meat, will ya?"

               Amanda caresses Hawk's cheek. He turns with her hand and 
               kisses it. He takes her arm and begins kissing his way up to 
               her neck, her cheek, her mouth...

               The man with the coat puts his shotgun against Trip's head.

               Trip GULPS. The jig's up. He slowly pulls out Stretch 
               Armstrong, and the man with the coat glances down and starts 
               to laugh very loud. So loud, he throws his head back.

               When he recovers, Trip's got Stretch aimed at his head and 
               pulled back to maximum tension.

               Trip lets go. WZZMACK! The man gets it right in the face and 
               falls backward onto the Hostess display, toppling a whole 
               bunch of Ho-Ho's, Ding-Dong's, Twinkies, and Suzy-O's to the 
               ground.

               Trip runs up and grabs the shotgun away as the man with the 
               coat lifts his head briefly, then passes out.

               Trip turns around and the cashier SLAMS into him, nearly 
               knocking him over. She throws her arms around him letting 
               out relieved SOBS. Behind her all the customers rise from 
               the floor CLAPPING. Trip did it. He saved the fucking store!

               The cashier looks into Trip's masked eyes.

               She plants a thousand mega-watt kiss on his lips and we ZOOM 
               IN on her mood ring changing color from gray to fire engine 
               red.

               Trip's eyes widen just before... KABOOM... The shotgun he's 
               holding goes off, blowing a hole in the ceiling.

               The recoil from the blast jolts Trip and the cashier apart.  
               We now see Trip's face is smeared with bright, red lipstick.  
               A huge chunk of ceiling falls onto his head but he doesn't 
               move. The kiss hit him harder.

               The cruiser takes off and the cashier stares at her mood

               We find Trip counting his money out to the little kid, Chongo, 
               and their two buds.

               THWAM! Right in Trip's face. Trip flies off his feet into 
               the Smiley Mart brick wall with a THUD. A bag of weed drops 
               from his jacket, then some uppers, a few sheets of acid, and 
               finally a can of beer rolls out.

               Chongo laughs like an ejaculating gorilla as he and his two 
               buds scoop it all up. The little kid, Chongo, and the buds 
               leave Trip lying in a puddle of his own nose blood.

               He pulls out Stretch Armstrong and looks at him fondly.

               Trip looks up. The six year olds who he stole it from stand 
               close by having watched the whole humiliating exchange. 
               Licked, Trip tosses the doll to them. They both dash away 
               with it, giggling.

               Jam approaches the stadium, passing the MATMOKS, walking 
               straight up to Mrs. Bruce. Her back is to him. He taps her 
               on the shoulder. She turns. Her jaw drops. It escaped again! 
               And what an ugly tee-shirt.

               Taken aback by his confidence, Mrs. Bruce grabs his ear and 
               tries to pull him away. He won't budge.

               A BUNCH OF IDIOTS walk by with big transistor radios. One of 
               them holds a Mr. Microphone and heckles the MATMOKS.

               Mrs. Bruce yells at Jam through her bullhorn.

               Jam yanks the Mr. Microphone from the lead idiot and screams

               receptacle and shouts down at his mother, his face slowly 
               turning purple.

                         how tough it was for you when you 
                         were growing up, and it's a good

               The crowd cheers. Jam jumps down and hands the Mr. Microphone 
               back to the lead idiot. He turns to his mom.

               Mrs. Bruce reaches into the trash, finds the drumsticks and 
               hands them to him. He spins them like pistols, then stuffs 
               them into his socks and walks away.

               Hawk runs to the scalper across the street who's selling a

                         another one for me!

               The scalper sees Hawk and bolts down the street disappearing 
               around a corner. Hawk stops. He's lost him.

               Hawk sulks to the now-familiar intersection where all four 
               landmarks meet. He takes one more look up the block at Cobo 
               Hall. Nearly all the KISS fans are inside. The streets are 
               almost deserted.

               He sees someone out of the corner of his eye across the 
               street. It's Jam. Lex approaches the other corner. Trip comes 
               up to the forth corner. They all stop when they see each

               12 YEAR OLD BRATS dressed like KISS by the scruffs of their 
               necks. She's furious, they're CRYING.

               Elvis stuffs all four tickets in his mouth and chews crazily. 
               In seconds, GULP. Elvis explodes into unhinged laughter as 
               he runs away zigzagged down the street.

               Our boys are left dumbstruck and speechless. After a really 
               long pause...

                         will let me speak.

</b>                         We all beat each other up, then, 
                         once we're nice and bruised, we run 
                         over to the ticket takers and say we 
                         got mugged and our tickets were 
                         stolen. They gotta let us in then.

               They stand and think for a moment. Hawk's mouth curls into a 
               devilish grin.

               Then, he lets out a gigantic "AIEEE!!! and slugs Jam. The 
               four boys brutally pummel one another in the middle of the 
               intersection. Punching. Kicking. Headbutting.

               Two TICKET TAKERS are letting the last KISS fans in. They're 
               about to close the doors when our four bloodied and bruised 
               heroes come running up.

               Trip points into the crowd of fans inside the auditorium 
               foyer.

</b>                         It was those assholes! They even 
                         stole my wallet!

               The ticket takers turn to see the little kid, Chongo, and 
               their two buds just going in. The ticket takers signal two 
               security guards who proceed to stop the four stunned kids 
               and confiscate their tickets. They find all the stolen dope 
               and Trip's wallet.

                         picture I.D. and a hundred fifty 
                         bucks cash.

               The security guards see he's right and break out the cuffs.

                         weasly, midget friend. You got spunk.

               The little kid for once is speechless.

               Then the ticket taker extends his arm in SLOW MOTION into 
               COBO Hall as if to say "Entrez Vous." The four friends pause.

               They take a few slow steps almost as if they don't believe 
               it, then run like the wind into the auditorium.

               The lights are out. The lighters have been lit. The CROWDS' 
               ROAR is deafening.

               Jam, Hawk, Trip, and Lex plow their way through the throngs 
               and head straight for the front row just as Simple Simon 
               takes the stage.

               Simple Simon runs from the stage just as the opening chords 
               to DETROIT ROCK CITY BEGIN.

               On the beat, BOOM, FIREWORKS shoot from the floor alighting 
               the place. KISS takes the stage descending on hydraulic 
               elevators.

<b>               ON JAM, HAWK, TRIP, AND LEX
</b>
               They're seeing God!

               The show is spectacular. The costumes. The make-up. The 
               blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics. The flashing KISS sign. Ace's 
               smoking guitar. Gene's spewing fire. Paul's rockin' vocals. 
               Peter's kick-ass beat.

               Then, something really weird happens.

               The crowd behind the boys heaves forward. Jam is pushed like 
               a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front 
               of him. Purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage 
               landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene. Just before 
               Peter's drum solo is about to start.

               Gene, Paul, and Ace silence their instruments. Peter throws 
               his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it 
               comes down. But the sight of Jam landing on the stage 
               distracts him.

               All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick. It hits the outside 
               edge of one of the drums.

               Thinking fast, Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his 
               sock and tosses it to Peter. It tumbles through the air in 
               SLOW MOTION with a LOW, WHOOPING, HELICOPTER SOUND. We see 
               the word "Mystery" clearly as it twirls.

               Instantly, it's caught in Peter Criss's hand and he brings 
               it down on his drum not missing a beat. The song resumes 
               with all its fury as Peter's drum kit ascends on a hydraulic 
               platform.

               Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience 
               barely missing the claws of some security guards.

               The four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage 
               exuberance. Will it ever get any better than this?
