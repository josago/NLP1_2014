          Music by Def Leppard, Styx, Journey, Poison, or Whitesnake

          Water cranked to a hundred and three
          Got my tunes, my snacks, my booze, my skis
          (Got the) freshest moves you ever seen
          When I'm soakin in my Hot Tub Time Machine
          When you're going back to the 80s...
          And you might be fuckin some ladies...
          You bring your button fly jeans and some sweet hair gel
          Want blow? All you gotta do is yell
          (Yeah you're) lookin real smooth, (and you're) lookin real mean
          When you're soakin in your Hot Tub Time Machine
          Yeah!
          Hot Tub - Time Machine!
          Hot Tub - Time Machine!
          C'mon!
           (Sweet guitar solo - 16 measures]
           Relaxed as hell when you're goin through time
          That's the 54 jets workin' on your spine
           (Yeah) you gotta be loose and you gotta be lean
          When you roll up in your Hot Tub Time Machine
          Yeah your shirt's a little psychedelic...
          And you're lookin kinda like Tom Selleck...
          Yeah the chicks are wetter than the Everglades
          But double bag your dude, don't wanna get AIDS
          Just listen right up, consider me your dean
          In the college of the Hot Tub Time Machine
          Yeah!
          Hot Tub - Time Machine!
          Hot Tub - Time Machine!
          Yeah!

          ADAM COLEMAN (late 30s, good-looking, sweet-natured face) is
          in a great mood as he packs a SUITCASE.

<b>          LILY (O.S.)
</b>          Ready for the wildest bachelor
          party of all time?
          LILY (early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy
          sense) walks in the room, smiling.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          You know it. I'm gonna bang all
          sorts of chicks this weekend!

<b>                         LILY
</b>          That's not the answer I was looking
          for.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Sorry, honey.
          Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss.
          She shows him some PHOTOS.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Look what I found...

</b>          A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS PARTY IN A LARGE HOT
          TUB at a SKI RESORT. It looks like the most fun ever.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Check out that young stud. Can you
          believe he's about to get married?
          Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM (17)
          partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS:
          -- In full 80s SKI GEAR on a mountain...
          -- Eating PIZZA at "Papa Enzo's," stuffing their faces...
          -- Drinking BEERS at the "Brew Haus," an awesome pub...
          -- In the HOT TUB with SIX GIRLS...
          Adam snatches the last photo from her.

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Ignore that one. Nothing happened.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I love you.
          Lily laughs.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Adam, you didn't know me yet.
          As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of
          the photos. She stops at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES.

<b>                         LILY (CONT'D)
</b>          Who's this?
          Lily shows Adam a PHOTO:
          -- A SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers).

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          I'm not sure.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Really?
          Lily shows Adam another PHOTO:
          -- YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks
          like she was ambushed for the photo.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Oh! Jennie.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Who's Jennie?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          She's nobody. Ski instructor.
          (off her look)
          You didn't know me yet.
          Lily still looks at him a little hard.

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and
          a face. Of course I'm gonna take
          her picture.
          Lily still looks a little bothered.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Do you still think of her?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Of course not! I think of you.
          As Adam goes to EMBRACE her:

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Hold on...
          Lily goes into the CLOSET.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Sweetie?
          She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX, which she
          empties onto the BED. About FIFTY PORNO MAGAZINES spill out,
          ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS.

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          How did you know where I hid my...
          treasure?
          Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile, holding it
          by the corner, not wanting to touch it.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Explain this.
          From ADAM'S POV, we see the brochure:
          -- A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover.

</b>
<b>                         ADAM
</b>          OK! You caught me! I
          occasionally... reminisce... about
          Jennie O'Keefe!

<b>                         LILY
</b>          That's gross.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          What's "occasionally?"

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          (without missing a beat)
          About two hours ago when you were
          on the phone with your mother.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Jesus. Tell me how I'm supposed to
          let you go to your bachelor party
          and not be a basket case?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          What are you so worried about?

<b>                         LILY
</b>          I'm worried that you're still
          thinking about this girl.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Baby, the girl in that picture was
          nothing more than a crush. I could
          never get her and there's no
          possibility I'll ever be with her.
          She was a total stranger.
          Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          So... you're into strangers?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Well not the creepy "your mom was
          in an accident, now come with me"
          kind. But yeah, the hot lady in
          the supermarket kind of stranger.
          You have to admit - it's kinda hot.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          So you're saying if you and I
          didn't know each other, it would be
          pretty hot if we fooled around?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          You kidding me? It would be
          fucking incredible.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>          5.
</b>          Lily smiles seductively, as Adam starts to get it.

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Wait a minute. Are you
          suggesting... yes. YES!
          Adam excitedly heads for the door.

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          OK, I'll go down the hall. You get
          into character.
          (points at her)
          This fucking rules.
          Adam leaves the room and Lily REMOVES HER SHIRT, talking sexy
          and slowly building the fantasy...

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Oh I'm all alone in this big house.
          Cheerleading camp just ended and I
          need to get out of these sweaty
          clothes...

<b>          ADAM (O.S.)
</b>          Love where you're going with this,
          baby! Keep it up!
          She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Mmmm. My panties are so tight
          against my firm naked body...

<b>          ADAM (O.S.)
</b>          You should probably take them off!

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Are you gonna let me do this?

<b>          ADAM (O.S.)
</b>          Sorry! Continue! You were just
          about to take off your panties!
          She slowly slides out of her panties, kicking them away. Now
          she's TOTALLY NAKED. She continues to role play.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          It feels so good to be so naked. I
          hope no one can see me...
          Just then a BLACK MAN (late 30s, handsome, J Crew) saunters
          through the bedroom door, holding a coffee and all riled up.

<b>

<b>

<b>          6.
</b>
<b>                         BLACK MAN
</b>          OK, so this asshole in front of me
          at the donut place is -- WHOA!
          Lily covers up and SCREAMS.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Get out of here!!
          He SPILLS the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns.

<b>                         BLACK MAN
</b>          Fuck! Ow! I'm sorry. I'll clean
          it up. That's gonna stain, though.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Just leave!
          He heads for the door, just as:
          Adam comes in, wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Special delivery for -- Jesus
          Christ!
          The black man doesn't know which way to look. He covers his
          eyes and drips coffee, as he blindly steps toward the door.

<b>                         BLACK MAN
</b>
<b>                         (NOT LOOKING)
</b>          Just tell me when I'm in the clear.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          Adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest,
          well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed
          and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag.
          They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER, where the
          black man, NICK, waits in the car, waving.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          I can't wait for you to come back
          and marry me. Wow, that's crazy.
          Adam looks almost like it just hit him.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         (REALIZATION)
</b>          Wow.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Tell me again I have nothing to
          worry about.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Babe, look at Nick...
          In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          You think with him in charge, we're
          gonna get into any kind of trouble?
          We'll probably eat too much pizza
          and I'll twist my ankle getting off
          the ski lift.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          OK. Have an awesome bachelor
          party. Not too awesome.
          (hands him bag)
          I got you something.
          Adam looks in the bag.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Sandwich. Thanks.
          He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting
          a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Let me see your phone.
          He takes it out.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          I told you, I'll call you when--
          She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as
          she pockets the phone.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna
          be one of those women who wants an
          update every ten minutes. Even
          though I do want an update every
          ten minutes.
          Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious.

</b>          Just make sure whatever happens,
          you're back for the rehearsal
          dinner.

<b>                         (SHOWING CONCERN)
</b>          I totally trust you.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          You should. I'm a lame-o.

<b>                         LILY
</b>          Well at least you're a cute lame-o.
          Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a
          disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off.
          From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          I'm more than willing to forget
          about earlier, but this shit's
          going on Facebook.

<b>          INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING
</b>
          Nick drives through SUBURBIA, while Adam rides shotgun.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          I have no idea what Facebook is.
          My phone has a button that says
          Send To Facebook. I've been
          sending shit there for months.
          Adam looks out the window, smiling.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          I'm so psyched about this weekend!

          Nick's car transitions from the HIGHWAY to the MOUNTAINS to
          the WOODS, as we track the drive.
          Finally, the car passes a "Welcome to Havenhurst" sign.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          Gentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst.

<b>          EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOON
</b>
          The car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a
          quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare,
          with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact
          opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos.

          The guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions.

          Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah

          The guys walk in and the first thing they notice is a bunch

          The large "living room" area off the lobby features a FIRE

          The guys walk silently behind a MIDDLE-AGED BELLHOP (PHIL),
          who struggles to wrangle their bags on a shaky hand truck.
          His job is made more difficult because he only has ONE ARM.
          He grunts and curses his way down the hall on the slow and
          laborious journey. But when Adam tries to pick up a bag...

          Nick gives Phil a bill and he walks off down the hall,
          leaving the guys outside their room.

<b>                         NICK

</b>          Let's give it a chance. We don't

          Nick nods, appreciating the optimism. He opens the door:

<b>          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON

          The room SUCKS. The ancient furniture looks like it smells
          like mold and there is nothing redeemable about the place.

          The guys drag their bags in and depressingly take stock of
          the situation -- presently the dirty old room.

          On a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a KICK-ASS
          TOP OF THE LINE HOT TUB. Spacious seating, plenty of jets,
          underwater lighting. It's amazing.

</b>          Well if you like roasts, I suggest
          the roast peking duck. It's out of
          this world and as I'm sure Aiden
          has told you, he can make it quite
          spicy.
          The guys look bothered.

<b>                         MANAGER (CONT'D)
</b>          But as for the noisy kind of roast,
          that's going to have to stop. We
          have many other guests trying to
          enjoy the P.F. Chang's experience.
          The manager walks away. For a moment, the guys are quiet.
          Lou takes a bite of his food, chewing slowly.

</b>          This kung pau chicken pairs very
          nicely with the 97 cab. Very

          Lou gets up and throws down his napkin.

          Adam and Nick get up too.

          Lou, Adam, and Nick all have HUGE SMILES, as they gaze at the
          tub. They each hold a TON OF BOOZE.
          Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all.
          Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN.

</b>          I really don't see the appeal.
          It's like a glorified bath.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the
          whole thing! You ski all day.
          Then you hit the town, get trashed,
          and lure some fine ladies back to
          the lodge for some good old
          fashioned tubbin'.
          Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.

<b>                         NICK (CONT'D)
</b>          So the town's dead? Fine, we skip
          that part and go right to the tub.
          Trust me. If there's fun to be
          had, the tub is a good start.
          Nick gets in.

<b>                         NICK (CONT'D)
</b>          Yes! It's amazing.
          Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three
          guys are already starting to look more energized and happy,
          splashing around. After another beat of consideration...

</b>          Fuck it.
          Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually
          starts to loosen up a bit and smiles.

</b>          Well?

<b>                         JACOB

</b>          Hit him with some bubbles.

          anything else they can get their hands on.
          -- Jacob's LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub, playing
          BETTER OFF DEAD. Every so often, one of our guys takes a
          drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know.
          -- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him.
          -- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures.
          More drinking games. The guys wear funny HATS and roll
          dice on a PIECE OF WOOD. Adam has to drink some tub water.
          -- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS.
          -- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's
          head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob
          coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles
          and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way.
          -- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another
          empty Red Bull his the patio.
          -- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC
          TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it.
          -- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM
          across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub.
          -- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3
          BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back.
          -- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very
          dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD.
          -- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the
          backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Red Bull or Fresca?
          Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.

          As the guys walk across the front of the lodge, they pass
          some well preserved CARS all parked together: a 1985 Pontiac
          Fiero, a 1986 VW Golf, and a 1987 Ford Mustang coupe.

</b>          -- A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF COKE and the tag:

          BABES and a shitload of BUD LIGHT.

          In QUICK CUTS, the guys hit the slopes:
          -- In his ridiculous snowsuit, Nick skis down the mountain.
          With the new snowfall, he expertly glides along.
          -- Jacob applies some LIP BALM and flies down the mountain on
          a SNOWBOARD. People glare at him with confused expressions.
          -- Adam uses the snowplow method to slowly descend. He's a
          beginner skier. He takes the time to look at the
          surroundings and notices a YOUNGER, HOTTER CROWD skiing
          today. Lots of BLONDE SKI BUNNIES wearing PASTEL colors.

          Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain
          and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE.

<b>          HE BARRELS INTO A SMOKING HOT CHICK!
</b>          The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and
          finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent.
          Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs.

</b>          What a rush!
          He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up.

</b>          The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING
          THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It twinkles in the
          sunlight. As she turns to face Adam,
          NORMAL SPEED RESUMES. And he sees who it is:

          He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still
          looks loopy from the coke.
          Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered
          hair, striped-jumpsuited guy (BLAINE) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM.

          he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too.

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)

</b>          You're dead meat, scumbag.
          Just then, SNOW POWDER flies in Blaine's face. Blaine lets
          go of Adam, as Jacob snowboards up and stops short, coming to
          his brother's side.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          There you are! My brother's had a

          Are you OK?
          Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look
          enamored with Jacob.

<b>                         CHAZ
</b>          Dude, they let you bring a
          skateboard on the mountain?

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          It's a snowboard. You know - no

          Adam picks up his BACKPACK, which fell off during the
          collision. He stares at Jennie again and smiles.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          You look JUST like this girl. I

          Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and SHOVES ADAM away.

<b>                         BLAINE
</b>          This is mine now.
          Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Come on. Let's just go.

          Adam and Jacob walk in the front door. Gone are the children
          and old people. The living room off the lobby presently
          hosts what appears to be an amazing 80s RETRO PARTY. A radio
          plays Miami Sound Machine's "Conga."
          Girls and guys wear printed sweaters, feathered dos, and neon
          leggings. It's something out of a mid-80s Aspen photo shoot.
          Nick walks in behind them, looking as confused as them. He
          turns up his palms and shakes his head, at a loss for words.

<b>                         ADAM

          Lou strolls up to the guys, with his arms around TWO HOT

</b>          If it's '87, the PF Chang's will be
          gone, which means the Brew Haus
          still stands.

</b>          Well, maybe one drink. Just to
          confirm.

<b>          INT. BREW HAUS - HAPPY HOUR
</b>
          SPLASH! A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST is underway on a STAGE.
          Whitesnake on the juke, PAC MAN on the tables, and cheap
          beers in the mugs - this is an amazing brew pub.
          Our guys sit in the back, wearing PINE VALLEY LODGE shirts.
          There are MANY EMPTIES on the table and they look VERY DRUNK.
          In a roped-off area in the corner, a cocky YOUNGER PHIL (the
          one-armed bellhop) wields a CHAINSAW that he uses to carve an
          ICE SCULPTURE, impressing the bar crowd. He has BOTH ARMS.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          Holy shit. It's that bellhop.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Should we warn him?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>
<b>                         (COVERS EYES)
</b>          I don't want to see this go down.
          Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN THE AIR and...
          He expertly CATCHES IT, seamlessly continuing to carve. A
          GIRL leans in and gives him a kiss.

<b>                         LOU
</b>          Fuck that guy.
          ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete for wettest t-shirt. They
          both decide that NO T-SHIRT is the wettest option.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          God bless our country.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          (in a daze)
          We're in 1987.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          You can stop saying that. I don't
          think it's making a difference.

          (kinda losing it)
          We seriously have to get back!
          The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings drinks.

<b>                         WAITRESS
</b>          Here ya go, guys. Three Buds, one
          Bartles and James.
          The guys all stare at her like she's a museum artifact.

<b>                         WAITRESS (CONT'D)
</b>          What? I have lipstick on my teeth?
          Nick sips his WINE COOLER, feeling the eyes of the others on
          him.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          Hey, if it's available, I'm
          ordering it. I always wanted one
          of these when I was little.
          The waitress puts down the CHECK. Jacob picks it up,
          realizing something.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          (to the waitress)
          Can you give us a second?
          She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys.

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>          This is gonna be a problem.
          He takes out his wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH.

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>          Guys, we're in trouble. Our cards
          aren't gonna work and our new money
          looks fake.
          The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something:

<b>          A TABLE FULL OF JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN.
</b>
<b>                         NICK
</b>          I've got an idea.
          As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks
          around the room and by the bar, he spots --

<b>

<b>          44.
</b>          Jennie.
          He stares at her from across the room. Lou and Jacob notice.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          I still can't believe it's really
          her!

<b>                         LOU
</b>          She's aged remarkably well.

<b>                         (REMEMBERS)
</b>          Oh, right. Why don't you just go
          talk to her?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          I should go talk to her. To
          apologize, of course. You know,
          nothing inappropriate.

<b>                         LOU
</b>          Sure...
          Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room.
          Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam approaches. He
          lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices him,
          as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn't look happy.

<b>                         JENNIE
</b>
<b>                         (TO ADAM)
</b>          Listen putz, if you're gonna try to
          attack me again, my boyfriend will
          be here soon. He'll kick your ass.
          Adam tries to be casual.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          No, no. No ass kicking. I just
          wanted to say I'm sorry about
          earlier. I lost control of the old
          skis there.

<b>                         (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
</b>          Looks like I shoulda taken another
          one of your classes!

<b>                         JENNIE
</b>          When did you take my class?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Certainly not when I was a kid! I
          mean, that would make no sense!
          Adam tries to recover.

<b>

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          I was here for a convention. Power
          tools. And regular tools. All
          sorts of tools. I'm big into
          tools. It was a couple years ago.
          Jennie looks very suspect of Adam.

<b>                         JENNIE
</b>          Yeah, OK. Have a good night.
          Jennie starts to walk away with her friends.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>
<b>                         (TOO FRIENDLY)
</b>          Hey, where ya going?
          She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind.

<b>                         JENNIE'S FRIEND
</b>          (quietly, to Adam)
          Are you with that guy over there?
          She discretely points out Jacob.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Yeah, he's my brother.
          She takes Adam's PALM and writes something on it.

<b>                         JENNIE'S FRIEND
</b>          There's a party later tonight at
          this address. Make sure he comes
          with you. He's way boss!
          Adam walks back to his friends.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          How'd it go?
          He shows them his palm.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          We got invited to a party later.

<b>                         LOU
</b>          sweet! What are we gonna do until
          then?

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          How about figure out how the hell
          to get back to the present day?
          Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Where did you get that money?
          Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen.

</b>
<b>                         (PROUDLY)

          Jacob looks incredulous.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          That was NOT a good idea!

<b>                         LOU
</b>          I agree. You left so much money on
          the table. It's a fucking iPod!

          Fellas, we are not making progress
          and we're losing time.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          Adam, don't worry. Time's not
          moving forward in the future.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Uh, yeah it is. Lest we forget the
          lessons learned from Bill and Ted.

<b>                         NICK

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          That's not fair. You can't go

          All four guys soak in the tub. They TOAST with drinks.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Here goes nothing!
          They simultaneously DOWN their drinks. Nothing happens.
          Like the chimps in 2001, each of them begins FIDDLING WITH
          KNOBS and PUSHING ON LIGHTS, trying to find the magic button.
          After a few moments:

<b>                         NICK
</b>          Well, it was worth a shot.
          ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND
          GIRL make out, two STONERS pass a joint, and one TOPLESS
          CHICK just chills out.

<b>                         LOU

          Looking ragged as hell, the four guys walk into the room and
          silently collapse on various BEDS and COUCHES.

<b>                         LOU
</b>          I wonder if we'll still be here for
          our court appearance.

</b>          If we're still here in four months,
          I will happily go to jail, because
          I'll be fucked anyway.
          A GUY walks out of the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He
          looks startled.

<b>                         TOWEL GUY

          Lou is up IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD
          and PUMMELS HIM on the floor! The others pull him off.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?!

<b>                         LOU

          Lou thinks for a moment and looks a "little" sorry.

</b>          I'm still pretty OK with it.

          The guys open the door to the suite and find TWO DUDES
          walking by. Adam stops them.

          The dudes take custody of the passed out TOWEL GUY and
          continue on down the hall, as our guys go back inside.

          The guys look physically exhausted.

<b>                         LOU
</b>          The point is you haven't even met

          ends up being tonight!
          Adam starts listening a little more closely, as some of Lou's
          logic actually makes "some" sense.

<b>                         LOU (CONT'D)
</b>          It's time to start facing the fact

          can for ourselves.
          The guys listen intently, as Lou's speech reaches a
          passionate climax.

<b>                         LOU (CONT'D)
</b>          Because I don't want to be that

          at the party.

<b>          INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT
</b>
          It's like the 80s exploded. Music, clothes, hair, attitude --
          it's all on overdrive. In one section, PARTY-GOERS marvel at
          DUCK HUNT, while in another area, people make out and dance.
          Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk in the front door. They have
          updated their "looks" with 80s sweaters and other era-
          appropriate attire. They all look ridiculous, except for
          Jacob, whose youth lends him hipster appeal.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          This sweater makes me look like a

          In a corner, Phil puts his ARM in a SHARK TANK. Just as the
          shark goes to bite, he PULLS HIS ARM OUT, unscathed. A small
          crowd claps. Our guys are confused and upset.

<b>                         NICK
</b>          Was this like an 80s thing?

<b>                         LOU
</b>          If he doesn't lose that arm soon,
          I'm gonna take it from him myself.
          With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at
          and groping girls as he goes.

          Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper and douchey. They are
          excited to see Jacob.

<b>                         TAD
</b>          Whoa. Product. You're blowing my

          in Europe?

<b>                         CHAZ
</b>          Don't tell me. Prague. Do you

<b>          IN THE LIVING ROOM

          earlier at the lodge. Her friend Sandy sits across from them
          next to Jacob, who looks uncomfortable.

<b>                         SANDY
</b>          Truth or dare?

          Jacob's eyes -- he smiles, knowing Jacob has his back.

<b>                         SANDY
</b>          OK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler
          up his ass.
          Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob.

</b>          You son of a bitch! Have you ever
          played this game before? It's
          supposed to be awesome!
          Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and
          shoves it down the back of his pants. His face contorts
          uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears.

<b>                         LOU (CONT'D)

<b>                         (SMILES)

<b>                         LOU
</b>          (grumbling to Michelle)
          I don't care. Whatever. This is

          I've never told anyone this, but I
          was afraid of scary movies until I
          was 18. I even ran out of the

<b>                         SANDY
</b>          OK, but you can't laugh.

<b>                         (WHO CARES)

</b>          So this one time me and my friend
          Lori took a train to Baltimore. It
          was the summer and we wanted to
          party, but we had no money. So
          Lori found this businessman who was
          also looking for a good time and
          told him that we'd give him a half
          and half for seventy-five dollars.
          You know -- a suck and fuck.
          Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT
          storytelling. Michelle smiles. She's heard it before.

<b>                         SANDY (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyway, we get him up to his room
          and Lori starts going down on him,
          but I really wasn't into it. So I
          broke a piece of the bathroom
          mirror and used it to cut his
          artery on the-heck. Right here...
          She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out.

<b>                         SANDY (CONT'D)

          forty-seven dollars.

          Nick's in the kitchen, catching POPCORN in his mouth and
          earning accolades from all his new fans.
          To Adam's RIGHT --
          The truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU'S
          EAR. He screams in pain, but at the end, he has a GOLD STUD

          As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD --
          He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE
          TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then
          he reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before
          getting up and WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard.

<b>                         ADAM

          here for a power tool convention.
          Jennie instinctively looks around for her friends.

</b>          I came here from the future.
          She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners.

<b>                         JENNIE
</b>          Let me guess. You want to beam me

<b>                         JENNIE
</b>          OK, what's the punch line?
          An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine.

<b>                         BLAINE

<b>                         BLAINE
</b>          Can't breathe? Is that right? Can
          you breathe, partner? What's that?
          I can't hear you. Just tell me you
          can't breathe and I'll stop.
          Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.

<b>                         BLAINE (CONT'D)

          he can breathe.

</b>          Babe, stop. Jennie, stop!
          Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She
          goes down. He releases Adam and turns to help her.

          creaks of mattresses, multiple "yesses."
          On TWIN BEDS that are a little too close to each other, Lou
          and Jacob have sex with Michelle and Sandy. The girls and
          Lou are vocal. Jacob is silent.
          As Sandy rides him, Jacob notices some BROKEN GLASS on the
          bedside table. He can't take his eyes off it, as Sandy's
          hand keeps brushing up against the table.
          Lou, naked, DRINKS A CAN OF TAB while he delivers the goods
          to Michelle. He reaches over, mid-act, and hands the half-
          empty can to Jacob.

          Nick leaves a pet store, carrying a BOX OF KITTENS. On the
          street, he accidentally bumps into one of the Japanese
          businessmen from the night before. He has a THICK ACCENT,
          like Gedde Watanabe in "Gung Ho."

          A GUY and a GIRL are using the hot tub, which is still hot
          and bubbly, despite the fact that it isn't plugged in.
          Nick and Lou sit at the table, as Adam approaches with CATS.

          There's no Red Bull in 1987.

          Adam doesn't get it. He's keeps falling.
          -- On the hill, Jacob teaches Adam how to SNOWBOARD. Adam is
          having an easier time standing up on the snowboard.
          -- The guys keep Adam awake and use a homemade SCALE MODEL of
          the mountain to formulate a plan, a la Iron Eagle.
          -- Back on the hill, Jacob and Adam snowboard next to each
          other. Adam makes it by a couple of obstacles. Jacob looks
          proud of him.
          -- The guys play an ATARI SKI GAME, trying out a strategy.
          Jacob uses a POINTER, looking disappointed.
          -- On the hill, Adam easily maneuvers by a few trees on the
          snowboard, kicking up snow and HIGH-FINING Jacob.

          speed, starting at about one mile per hour.

          coast to victory.

          crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE,
          despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course.
          He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!
          Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more
          recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam.
          Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force.

          MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up.
          Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the
          dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock

          LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain.
          With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch

</b>          Lily had every opportunity to
          leave. She didn't know me at all
          and she certainly didn't owe me
          anything after the night I put her
          through. But she stayed.

          Adam lays on the couch, his head in Lily's lap. She feeds
          him a little GATORADE. He keeps it down... for a moment.
          Then he turns and VOMITS into a BUCKET on the floor.

<b>          ADAM (V.0.)
</b>          She saw me at my worst and she
          stayed.
          Lily holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Don't you see? This is more than a

          Adam holds up the sandwich.

          Adam walks outside, taking a bite of the SANDWICH. He finds
          Jennie waiting in the TUB.

</b>          When I saw you win that race

          Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Yeah, I... can't.
          She covers up, embarrassed.

<b>                         JENNIE
</b>          Oh my god. I missed my

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          No, I'm not sure there ever was an

          many moments of joy, you'll never
          know. But I shouldn't have given
          you the wrong idea.

          And I'm totally cool with it.
          Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But
          then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves closer to her.

<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)

          everything and travel across time

          She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her.

          The guys stare at the tub, which continues to bubble, even

<b>                         NICK
</b>          We don't have to go yet, Adam.

          Adam reaches in his backpack, but can't find the Red Bull.
          He turns it inside out and shakes it -- nothing.

<b>                         JACOB

</b>          I don't want Jennie.

<b>                         BLAINE
</b>          That's funny. I don't want this
          soda, either.
          Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam's face goes desperate,
          as Blaine OPENS THE CAN and DRINKS THE WHOLE THING.

          ground, Adam BEATS THE LIVING HELL out of Blaine, messing up
          his face. It makes the Jared Leto scene from Fight Club look
          tame. Eventually, Adam's friends pull him off.
          Adam crawls to the Red Bull can and it's empty.
