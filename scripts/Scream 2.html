</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   An old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in
   a small town. Very picturesque. The marquee in front
   reads:
<b>   
</b><b>   "SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT
</b><b>   'STAB'
</b>   Rated R"
<b>   
</b>   A line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS -
   mostly college age.
<b>   
</b>   CLOSE on a girl, MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly
   face with innocent eyes. She stands in line with her
   boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             I hate scary movies.

</b>             It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your
             hand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             If we hurry, we can still catch the
             Sandra Bullock movie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       PHIL
</b>             We got free tickets.
<b>   
</b>   He pulls her close, snuggling with her.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. BOX OFFICE
</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their
   tickets.
<b>   
</b>   They pass through the front doors where an USHER stands
   randomly handing out GHOST MASKS. A Hollywood variation
   of a most familiar one. Phil takes one.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             What's that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       USHER
</b>             The studio sent them.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. THEATRE - A MINUTE LATER
</b><b>   
</b>   The small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen
   and Phil enter, moving down the aisle searching for two
   seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them as a
   GHOST MASKED GUY chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS.
   Everyone is having fun.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the
   screen just as the lights DIM. People FAKE SCREAM in
   terror. A very lively crowd.

</b>             I don't think so.
<b>   
</b>   Phil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him.

</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the
   audience. A sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre.
   The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A
   chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked.

</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere.
   Lights burn from within.
<b>   
</b>   Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is
   taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile
   body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the
   curtain. It's all very PSYCHO.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             Now why does she have to be naked?
             How does that serve the plot?

</b>             Sssshhh.

</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower
   curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She
   grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living
   room, grabbing the phone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GIRL
</b>             Hello?
<b>   
</b>   A menacing VOICE responds.

</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen is not having a good time. She's already

</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen shifts in her seat.
<b>

</b>             Why doesn't she just hang up and
             call the police? Stupid..

</b>             I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
<b>   
</b>   He nods. Maureen stands and moves up the aisle.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small
   lobby. It is dark and shadowed. She moves down a long
   hallway to a staircase. A "BATHROOM" sign with an arrow
   points downstairs.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen hits the stairs to...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. BASEMENT LOUNGE - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   A small lounge leads to two bathroom doors. Very low
   lighting. Maureen descends the stairs, heading for
   the...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. GIRL'S RESTROOM - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   A large bathroom. Five stalls line one wall. The door
   CREAKS open. Maureen enters and shoots for a stall.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INSIDE THE STALL - MOMENTS LATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen finishes up, fastening her pants. Suddenly, the
   bathroom door CREAKS open. Maureen listens. FOOTSTEPS
   are heard. Loud and heavy.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door. Not much is
   visible. Suddenly, a SHADOW sweeps by. The footsteps
   stop.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen finishes up quickly. She flushes, throws the
   stall door open and rushes out to find...
<b>   
</b><b>   THE BATHROOM EMPTY.
</b><b>   
</b>   The stall doors are all closed. Maureen shoots for the
   door. She rips the door open as a FIGURE rushes her...
<b>   
</b>   A YOUNG GIRL followed by her FRIEND, both perky and
   loud. They hurl past Maureen, LAUGHING and carrying on.
<b>   
</b>                       GIRL #l
             I got so scared my bladder rolled.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GIRL #2
</b>             You chicken shit. It's just a
             movie.
<b>   
</b>                       GIRL # l
             No, it really happened. It's a true
             story.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen is out the door. Now thoroughly spooked.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. BASEMENT LOBBY - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Alone, Maureen moves for the stairs when a FIGURE
   emerges from the shadows. A GHOST MASKED SHAPE
   appearing behind her...
<b>   
</b>   LUNGING FOR HER, grabbing her, spinning her around. She
   SCREAMS MADLY as the Ghost starts LAUGHING. The mask
   comes off. It's Phil.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             You ass.
<b>   
</b><b>                       PHIL
</b>             I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to.
             It was too easy.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             You are so not funny.
<b>   
</b>   Phil takes her in his arms.
<b>   
</b><b>                       PHIL
</b>             Come on, baby. Lighten up a little,
             will ya?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             I get scared really easy, okay.
<b>   
</b><b>                       PHIL
</b>             You gotta go with it. Scary movies
             are great foreplay.
<b>   
</b>   He's sincere. He leans down and plants a kiss on her.
   She caves, kissing him back. Sweet and sensual.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             I just have a hard time with
             insipid, sexist violence.
<b>   
</b><b>                       PHIL
</b>                   (nibbling her neck)
             We can still Sandra Bullock it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>                   (nibbling back)
             Sandra started without us. We can
             stay. He kisses her again, then
             breaks away.
<b>   
</b><b>                       PHIL.
</b>             Yeah? Okay. I gotta whizz. Meet me
             upstairs?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             Want some popcorn?
<b>   
</b><b>                       PHIL
</b>             Butter.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen moves up the stairs out of sight. Phil turns,
   reaching for the bathroom door just as a...
<b>   
</b>   GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears in his path. Phil steps
   back, surprised. Suddenly, a flash of silver shoots
   forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife. Quick
   and silent. He bellies over just as the Ghost Shape
   strikes again. Phil goes down without a scream.

</b><b>   INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER
</b><b>

   of popcorn.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. DARK THEATER - SECONDS LATER

   on.

</b><b>   
</b>   A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The
   young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING,
   flying through the room.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE THEATER
</b><b>   
</b>   The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to
   the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house."
   etc.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat. She sits
   down next to...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   PHIL
</b><b>   
</b>   Who sits with the mask on. The reflection from the
   movie bouncing against it in the darkness.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             Give it up.

<b>   
</b><b>

</b><b>   
</b>   The young girl slips out a side door, completely
   terrified. In her hand, she holds a portable phone.

   lips, SSSHHING her.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST
   MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through
   the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting
   away, running...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE THEATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her
   best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her
   popcorn.

</b><b>                       MAUREEN
</b>             This is so tired.

</b>             Hey, you... pasty face...
<b>   
</b>   Phil ignores her. She reaches over in the darkness
   putting her hand on his knee. She inches it up. The
   Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead.
<b>

</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE THEATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand
   continues to move between Phil's legs. She stares
   ahead, WINCING at what's about to happen to the girl on
   screen.
<b>   
</b>   She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting
   knife from inside his coat jacket. Maureen's hand moves
   up Phil's jacket... something stops her. She feels
   something on her fingers... something wet. She pulls
   her hand back, the reflected movie illuminating bloody
   fingers.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen stares at her hand...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her,
   pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife.
   The young girl is helpless...

</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE THEATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen looks at Phil, confused... as if seeing for the
   first time... IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the
   Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other
   one clutching the hunting knife.
<b>   
</b>   Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD
   SCREAM that is matched by the entire audience as they
   SCREAM at the screen.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON SCREAM
</b><b>   
</b>   The young girl is stabbed in the heart.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE THEATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen is helpless. The knife comes fast and furious,
   striking her in the stomach. She falls forward, into
   the aisle as...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   The young girl, clutching her bloody chest... drags
   herself, crawling across wet grass... the killer behind
   her... raising his knife again.

</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE THEATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle,
   clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable
   to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to
   see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle.
<b>   
</b>   Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several
   PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see
   the Ghost Face coming at her again... knife raised.
<b>

</b><b>   ON SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   The young girl is slashed again.
<b>

   theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost
   keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A
   horrifying, sickening sight.
<b>

   to the front of the theater. Suddenly, the entire
   audience begins...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   APPLAUD AND CHEER
</b><b>   
</b>   Maureen, swaying from side to side, turns to the crowd
   and emits a HORRENDOUS BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM as...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   The young girl lets out an enormous EAR SCREECHING
   SCREAM that mirrors Maureen's as the killer attacks one
   last time, stabbing her, silencing her forever.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE THEATER
</b><b>   
</b>   The Ghost slashes out one last time, direct and fierce.
   Maureen falls back against the movie screen... very
   much dead. Her arms flail across the screen... smearing
   blood over the wide screen image of the GHOST MASK.

   Attractive, sullen. Sad.

             for someone who wants to be left
             alone.
<b>   
</b>   Hallie hits the remote. The man's image disappears as
   the TV goes off. Hallie turns, all smiles.
<b>

   Recovery is immediate.

<b>   
</b>   Sid moves to the door and throws it open. A GHOST
   FIGURE LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS but then stops
   herself.
<b>   
</b>   It's just a costume hung from her doorframe. Preset, to
   scare. Another prank. Sidney rips it down, turns to
   Hallie, throwing the costume at her.

   She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a

</b>   He looks at her with bedroom eyes.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             I can do that. And I can also do
             this.
<b>   
</b>   He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing
   her passionately. She breaks away, laughing.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             No PDA.
<b>   
</b>   But it's a failed objection. He kisses her again and
   they're soon devouring each other like two people in
   love. Right in the middle of the hallway.

</b><b>   EXT. STUDENT UNION - LATE AFTERNOON
</b><b>   
</b>   The place is a circus. The front steps of the student
   center have been roped off to form a platform. A podium
   and mike have been placed center.
<b>   
</b>   CROWDS have gathered for the press conference that is
   being held by the university. Reporters and cameras
   have been roped off to the side. On stage, DEAN FISHER,
   a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to
   spectators.

</b>                   (reading from a

             "... and we feel this unfortunate
             isolated tragedy in no way reflects
             upon our fine school and we should
             trust that the authorities and FBI
             are acting quickly to bring us
             answers..."
<b>   
</b>   Beside her stand uniformed COPS, the local SHERIFF, FBI
   AGENTS. She continues on...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE ROPED OFF NEWS SECTION
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale walks through the crowd, listening to the Dean.
<b>   
</b><b>                       FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>             Gale? Can I have a second?
<b>   
</b>   Gale spins around to find DEBBIE SALT, the flashy
   reporter who she decked earlier, standing in front of
   her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Look, I'm sorry about the face.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT

<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Fair enough.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             What are you doing here? I thought
             you had retired from field
             reporting?
<b>   
</b>   The woman has immediately put Gale on the defensive.
   TWO OTHER REPORTERS have taken notice. Suddenly,
   CAMERAS are on Gale.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Well, you know I'm dear to the

</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT

<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE

<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT

</b>             Good for you.
<b>   
</b>   And in seconds the vultures are upon her as Gale
   Weathers is beseiged by REPORTERS. The questions spew
   forth. "Why are you here?" "Is this the work of a
   copycat killer?" "Have you talked to Sidney?" etc.

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON STAGE
</b><b>   
</b>   The LOCAL SHERIFF, a smart looking guy in his 50's is
   fielding questions.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SHERIFF
</b>             No, we have no evidence of a serial

</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON THE LAWN
</b><b>   
</b>   Students and concerned faculty stand. Among them are
   Sidney, Derek, Hallie and Mickey. Next to them stand
   JOEL, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. A very
   intelligent face.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             But what are they doing? He's
             talking but he's not saying
             anything.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JOEL
</b>             Sounds like they don't know

<b>   
</b>   From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls,
   LOIS and MURPHY stand with their FRATERNITY JOCK
   BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on
   Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JOEL
</b>             Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
<b>

</b>             This has nothing to do with me,
             Joel. There's an estimated 270
             serial killers currently active in
             the US at any given time. I can't
             control that. Who's hungry?

</b><b>                       MICKEY

<b>   
</b>   Hallie kicks him. Joel moves to Sid.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JOEL
</b>             I gotta hit the library. Anatomy.

<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             You're not allowed to ask that.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JOEL

<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY

<b>   
</b>   Joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls,
   Lois and Murphy saunter over.

</b>   Instantly, Hallie stands at attention. Sidney joins

             She runs dead smack into...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DEWEY

</b>             My morn was a Delta.
<b>   
</b>   Beat. People have begun to notice the two of them
   talking. Reporters and spectators have slowly circled
   them. Gale looks around. She spots Randy, who appears
   behind Sid, with his camera. Gale gives him the nod. He
   throws the camera up, hits the light.
<b>   
</b>   Sid spins around, surprised to see him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Randy? What are you doing here?
<b>   
</b>   But then she sees someone else, standing off to the
   side. A man she recognizes immediately. He looks at;
   her, his face sullen, broken. Sidney loses her breath.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Cotton...
<b>   
</b>   He moves to her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             Hello, Sidney.
<b>   
</b>   Gale motions to Randy. He maneuvers, getting the two of
   them in frame. A long moment, Sidney just stares at
   him. Completely off guard. She looks to Randy who aims
   the camera directly at her... filming her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             What are you doing?
<b>   
</b>   She turns back to Gale, staring holes through her,
   realizing she's been set up. She looks back to Cotton.
   She doesn't know what to say. She turns back to Gale.
   Eyes aflame.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             You BITCH!
<b>   
</b>   Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton
   turns to Gale. His face pained.
<b>   
</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             This was a mistake. I shouldn't be
             here.
<b>   
</b>   He takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops
   filming.
<b>   
</b><b>                       RANDY

<b>   
</b><b>                       RANDY
</b>             Yeah, I got it.
<b>   
</b>   Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's
   in his voice.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. KITCHEN - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   A large, dark kitchen. Cici moves to the frig and opens
   it, She gives it the once over. The frig light reflects
   against her face. She closes the refrigerator, not
   seeing the Shadow that bounces across her back.
<b>   
</b>   Cici moves to a sliding glass door that overlooks the
   backyard. She checks the lock. Secure. Then, the phone
<b>   RINGS.
</b><b>   
</b>   She turns to the phone that's attached to a nearby
   wall. It RINGS AGAIN. She reaches for it, answering it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CICI
</b>             Hello?
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SUDDENLY, TWO HANDS LUNGE OUT OF THE DARKNESS
</b><b>   
</b>   One finds her neck, the other grabs her by the hair,
   wrenching her head backwards and spinning her around,
   shoving her, pushing her into the...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SLIDING GLASS DOOR
</b><b>   
</b>   Glass explodes everywhere, shattering to bits as Cici's
   body crashes through it, setting off the ALARM. A loud,
   shrill RING resonants through the house as Cici's body
   lands on the deck outside. Still. (NOTE: WES DOES
<b>   REALLY SCARY SHIT HERE.)
</b><b>   
</b><b>                                               CUT TO:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Two doors down from Chi Omega. A big, old Gothic home
   serves as the Delta Zeta sorority. MUSIC PLAYS from
   inside. It sounds like a party.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
</b><b>   
</b>   The room is filled with fifteen to twenty people.
   SORORITY GIRLS and FRAT BOYS who SCREAM and CHEER as
   they watch four girls who sit on their knees, hands
   behind their back, in front of a coffee table devouring
   plates of macaroni and cheese topped with whipped
   cream.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney, Hallie, and two other girls, TERI and LUCE tear
   into the macaroni with all their might. Gobbling it up,
   making a mess of themselves. Mickey is next to Hallie,
   coaching her on. On Sid as she finishes her plate.
<b>   
</b>   A whistle BLOWS.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MURPHY (CONT'D)
</b>             Looks like we have a winner.
<b>   
</b>   Sid sits up. Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her
   face. She smiles the victor. Everyone APPLAUDS.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MURPHY (CONT'D)
</b>             Sidney gets to skip the next round
             of Bulimia bingo.
<b>   
</b>   Hallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid.
<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             You bitch.
<b>   
</b>   They crack up. Someone passes her a towel. She stands
   wiping her face, looking across the room as Derek
   enters through the front door. She waves at, him. He
   hurries over.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Where have you been'? You missed my

<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
<b>   
</b><b>

</b><b>   
</b>   Mickey is cleaning off Hallie's face.

</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             I don't want you to choke or

<b>   
</b>   She swats him.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON SID AND DEREK
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>                   (complete throw away)

<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK

<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             The forbidden subject.
<b>   
</b>   He shakes his head.
<b>   
</b>   Suddenly, a FRAT BOY pops into the room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       FRAT BOY
</b>             Yo, guys, outside. Something's up
             at the Chi Omega. Police are
             everywhere.
<b>   
</b>   People begin to stand, moving to the windows and front
   door. Sidney looks to Derek.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Everyone comes flying out of the front door and into
   the yard as POLICE CARS WHIP BY. SIRENS BLARING.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ANGLE ON STREET
</b><b>   
</b>   Two doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with
   police, ambulances, reporters...
<b>   
</b>   "Yo - let's check it out." "C'mon." The entire crowd
   takes off in droves down the street. All except for...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SIDNEY AND DEREK
</b><b>   
</b>   They stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes
   a circus.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
</b><b>   
</b>   She knows.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. CHI OMEGA HOUSE - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Captain Tyler, the Sheriff, police, FBI... the house is
   crawling. Dewey sifts around on his own, checking
   things out.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE KITCHEN
</b><b>   
</b>   Captain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered
   glass door.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SHERIFF
</b>             Lots of blood. But no body.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CAPTAIN TYLER

<b>   
</b><b>                       SHERIFF
</b>             Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CAPTAIN TYLER

<b>   
</b>   The Sheriff turns to his men.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SHERIFF
</b>             Alright men, listen up...
<b>   
</b>   Dewey is all ears.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Derek and Sid stand on the porch, his arms around her.
   Her face is numb.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             It's starting all over again.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             Lemme take you home.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             I'll get my jacket.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney, indifferent, moves through the open front door,
   back inside the house. Her face and mind detached from
   what's going on. Derek remains on the porch, watching
   the spectacle. Slowly, the door behind him closes.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat
   when the phone RINGS. She looks at it suspiciously...
   knowingly... she reaches for it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Hello?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAN'S VOICE
</b>             Hello Sidney?
<b>   
</b>   The VOICE. Low and haunting. Sidney closes her eyes.
   When she opens them tears are immediate But still, she
   refuses to crack.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Who are you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAN'S VOICE
</b>             Soon, Sidney, soon.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             What do you want?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAN'S VOICE
</b>             To see every ounce of blood drain
             from your body.
<b>   
</b>   The Voice has never sounded more evil... more
   seductive. Sidney doesn't flinch. She holds steady.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Then come and get me.
<b>   
</b>   And with that Sidney hangs up the phone, SLAMMING it
   down. Silence. And then...
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAN'S VOICE
</b>             My pleasure.
<b>   
</b>   The Voice comes from inside the room... behind her.
   Sidney spins around and finds herself staring at the...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   GHOST MASKED FIGURE
</b><b>   
</b>   But not the one from the movie theater. The one from
   Sidney's nightmare long ago. It stands in the foyer
   archway, staring at her.
<b>   
</b>   A sustained moment. A stand off. Sidney doesn't move.
   But then the killer withdraws his trademark. A long,
   steel hunting knife... blood stained.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SIDNEY BOLTS
</b><b>   
</b>   As the GHOST LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS, dodging him,
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON THE PORCH
</b><b>   
</b>   Derek hears her SCREAM. He turns to the front door. He
   finds it locked. He starts to BEAT on it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             Sid? Sid?
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE LIVING ROOM
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid just dodges the Ghost, just missing the knife's
   blade. She bolts through the living room, to the front
   door. Derek beats on it from outside.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE FOYER
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Derek. He's in the house. Help...
             me...
<b>   
</b>   She struggles with the door, there are too many locks,
   the Ghost is already upon her. She looks to the stairs,
   thinks better of it... flies through the dining room.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. FRONT PORCH - SANE
</b><b>   
</b>   Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house. He
   moves along the porch to the windows, looking through.
   He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the
   kitchen. Derek looks about the porch. He rears his foot
   back and kicks in the window.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. KITCHEN - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door. She
   struggles with the lock as the Ghost is right behind
   her. She barely makes it out the back door...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. BACK YARD - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   A large, fenced in yard. Lots of big oak trees. Sid
   flies down the back porch and into the yard. She moves
   across it, passed trees and shrubs. She spots a closed
   fence door in the back of the yard. She looks behind
   her to find...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   NOTHING
</b><b>   
</b>   She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely
   disappeared. She moves behind a big tree, hiding behind
   it.
<b>   
</b>   Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind
   the tree. The yard is completely empty. She goes for
   the fence door, slowly moving around the tree.
<b>   
</b>   BUMP! A noise in the darkness. She spins around, still
   making her way around the tree, moving backwards,
   walking right into a FIGURE. She SCREAMS, spinning
   around, finding herself face to face with...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CICI'S BODY
</b><b>   
</b>   Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a
   ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE
   HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms
   of...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DEWEY
</b><b>   
</b>   She turns, SCREAMING.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.
<b>   
</b>   He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she
   holds on for dear life.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - MORNING
</b><b>   
</b>   The early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and
   joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly
   comes to life.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING
</b><b>   
</b>   The local campus security office has been converted
   into a media event. News trucks, cameras and REPORTERS
   stand guard outside while inside...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING
</b><b>   
</b>   The place is packed. No longer just a campus security
   office. The place has been converted to the local
   police station as well as FBI headquarters. UNIFORMS
   and SUITS swarm the place.
<b>   
</b>   In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and
   Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean
   Fisher. Tempers are heated. Its been a sleepless night
   for all.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CAPTAIN TYLER
</b>             We don't know if it's random. We
             haven't been able to connect the
             victims.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SHERIFF
</b>             The first two were stabbed without
             thought. The sorority girl was
             gutted with autopsy precision.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEAN FISHER
</b>             Christ! Just do something. I will
             not have a repeat of Gainesville.
             Not on my campus. .
<b>   
</b>   Dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping
   forward.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             Sidney Prescott, sir.
<b>   
</b>   They both turn to him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
</b>             She's the connection.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CAPTAIN TYLER
</b>             We know that, son.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             The killer was trying to get to
             her. That sorority girl was a
             distraction.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CAPTAIN TYLER
</b>             We're aware of that.
<b>   
</b>   Sheriff Hartley steps forward.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             The killer is obviously repeating
             Woodsboro. I can fill you in on
             what I know.
<b>   
</b>   Dewey is not a welcome participant. Eyes roll. Captain
   Tyler pulls Dewey aside.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CAPTAIN TYLER
</b>             Look, son. I know you've lived
             through this, but we got it under
             control. Why don't you have some
             coffee?
<b>   
</b>   Just then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by
   TWO UNIFORMS. Dean Fisher greets her with smiles The
   FBI and local police fawn over her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SHERIFF
</b>             Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming
             in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Of course, what can I do?
<b>   
</b>   Captain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the
   back, sending him off.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CAPTAIN TYLER
</b>             We were hoping you could help with
             the killer's profile.
<b>   
</b>   Dewey's face couldn't be more burned.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING - MINUTES LATER

<b>   
</b>   Dewey speaks up. His voice soft but heard. The entire

   looks away.
<b>   
</b><b>                       CAPTAIN TYLER

<b>

</b><b>                       MICKEY

<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       JOEL
</b>             It's documented. Most serial
             killers are attractive - slightly
             off white males in their twenties.
<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             That's you, honey.
<b>   
</b>   Hallie kisses Mickey again.
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             What?
<b>   
</b>   Suddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins
   to sing at the top of his lungs.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             "If I should stay. I would only be

</b>             Don't do this.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             "And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always

             always love you."
<b>   
</b>   Everyone has taken notice. They begin to cheer and sing
   with him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JOEL
</b>                   (to Derek)
             Whitney?
<b>

</b>             Definitely Whitney.
<b>   
</b>   Hallie can't help but be touched. He finishes up,
   ending on a last, final note. As he does, he pulls a
   necklace from around his neck. His Greek letters dangle
   from it. He places them around her neck, kissing her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JOEL
</b>             Isn't that a big no-no?
<b>

</b>             I think so.
<b>

<b>

             alone a sadness seeps to the
             surface and in a moment of clarity
             you know that all you really want
             is to be touched and held and
             fondled.
<b>   
</b>   Gale stares at him, stunned. A moment as the tension
   swirls about them.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE

<b>   
</b>   Dewey approaches her. Gale has never been more taken
   with him. They stand incredibly close.

<b>   
</b>   Shit! Randy motions to Gale and Dewey. It's him. He
   points around campus, mouthing "He's watching." Gale
   grabs Dewey.
<b>

</b>   Gale spots a YOUNG MAN, sitting with some other KIDS.
   He's talking on a cellular phone. She races to him and

</b>   Dewey appears.

   The place is packed.

</b>   Day turns to night and college life comes to a deadly
   stand still as everyone observes the imposed campus
   restrictions.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. SIGMA PHI EPISILON - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   The fraternity house sits dark and quiet. A YOUNG MAN
   walks up the walk to the front door. He TAPS on it
   three times and it quietly opens as he's ushered in.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT SIGMA PHI HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   The young man makes his way down a long hallway, down a
   spiral staircase, through a thick basement door and
   into...

</b><b>   
</b><b>   A RAGING PARTY
</b><b>   
</b>   Music peels paint as YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS rock to
   deafening tunes. A row of kegs line one wall as a the
   party gears up for a drunken night ahead.
<b>   
</b>   Derek is seen with his video camera. He's filming Lois
   and Murphy. They talk into the camera. Both tipsy
   chatty.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOIS
</b>             It's all about sisterhood.
             Everybody thinks its about partying
             and blowjobs but...
<b>   
</b><b>                       MURPHY

             sex.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOIS
</b>             ... it's really about family and

<b>

</b><b>                       LOIS

<b>   
</b>   Mickey approaches as Derek finishes up.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             Thanks, ladies.

</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             You freakin?
<b>   
</b>   Derek shrugs. He's clearly upset by it when from out of
   nowhere, SEVERAL FRAT BOYS appear, picking Mickey up,
   lifting him over their heads. Everyone starts CHEERING
   and CLAPPING.
<b>   
</b><b>                       FRATERNITY JOCK
</b>             He lavaliered. He's dead.
<b>   
</b>   They carry him around the room, CHANTING. The frat boys
   abduct Mickey, taking him up the stairs and out sight.
   Others lookie loo's follow. Derek grabs his camera and
   bolts.

</b>   They're reviewing STAB. Hallie switches channels.
   There's a KNOCK on the door. Sid answers - it's Dewey

<b>   
</b>   A burn. It comes out of nowhere. Gale goes silent. A

<b>   
</b><b>                       JOEL
</b>             They got Mickey. He's being toasted

<b>

   composed of several bike locks and steel twine. He's
   not going anywhere.

</b>             We feel like Kevin Costner.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on
   the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank
   Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but
   it's cut short.
<b>   
</b>   Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel
   struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a
   Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car
   towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too

<b>   
</b>   A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is
   slit.

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE FRONT SEAT
</b><b>   
</b>   The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then
   gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the
   car in drive and takes off down the road.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay
   sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the
   door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic,
   and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use.

</b>   Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another
   campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each
   side of a thin, road.
<b>   
</b>   She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The
   white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The
   Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her.
   She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She
   pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow
   No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal
   grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck
   is right up against it.
<b>   
</b>   Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the
   Ghost's head, ready to attack.
<b>   
</b>   Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate,
   into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost
   falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for
   a moment.
<b>   
</b>   The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building.
   The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to
   bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post
   that stands directly in the car's path.
<b>   
</b>   The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,
   SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,
   lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.
<b>   
</b>   Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
   rumbling.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INSIDE THE CAR
</b><b>   
</b>   All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the
   floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked
   figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.
<b>   
</b>   Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,
   sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It
   won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the
   car. It's flush against the building.
<b>   
</b>   Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been
   pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,
   pulling on it, bending it backwards...
<b>   
</b><b>   CREAK!
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while
   eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates
   an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She
   lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   FRONT SEAT
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving
   the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed
   passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
   BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His
   body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
<b>   
</b>   The only way out is through the driver's door.
<b>   
</b>   After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over
   with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.
   Nothing.
<b>   
</b>   She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to
   his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
   Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against
   the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass
   through.
<b>   
</b>   She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her
   leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans
   against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching
   for the door knob.
<b>   
</b><b>   HONK!
</b><b>   
</b>   Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face
   a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He
   doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the
   car door open and starts to slide completely over the
   Ghost when she stops.
<b>   
</b>   She looks to the Ghost.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSE ON HER FACE
</b><b>   
</b>   As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce
   determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She
   finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
   when...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE
</b><b>   
</b>   Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out
   the car door.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   OUTSIDE THE CAR
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BAM!
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when
   her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
<b>   
</b>   The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into
   the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She
   hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.
   Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,
   knocking him backwards.
<b>   
</b>   Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the
   pavement.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               CUT TO:

</b><b>   EXT. FILM SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER
</b><b>   
</b>   The film school sits in the still darkness.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. HALLWAY - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey and Gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway.
   THUMP! They stop cold.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Ssshh! What was that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             Let's find out.
<b>   
</b>   Dewey keeps moving.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             This is all too familiar.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             Over here.
<b>   
</b>   Dewey has lead her to a door marked "LECTURE HALL".
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   The same room seen earlier. A large, rounded room with
   three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the
   ceiling. A podium stands center. Video monitors hang
   from the ceiling in different places around the room.
<b>   
</b>   Dewey and Gale enter. If not for the red EXIT SIGNS
   that hang over the exit doors, the room would be
   completely dark.
<b>   
</b>   They move down the first level of chairs to the
   lecturn.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Maybe they never got here. He could
             have taken her anywhere.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             C'mon. Let's go.
<b>   
</b>   CLICK! STATIC! A noise from above takes their
   attention. They looks up as a video monitor comes to
   life. Images appear.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSE ON MONITOR
</b><b>   
</b>   Home-made video footage fills the screen. A movie
   theatre, people standing in line. The home camera ZOOMS
   in to a YOUNG COUPLE. Maureen and Phil come into view.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON DEWEY AND GALE
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room,
   searching for it's source.
<b>   
</b>   CLICK! Another monitor comes to life. More home shot
   video footage. This time of a big house. A closer look
   reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House. A young
   girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable
   phone. It's Cici.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON GALE AND DEWEY
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Jesus Christ!
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             He filmed his victims.
<b>   
</b><b>   CLICK! ANOTHER MONITOR TURNS ON.
</b><b>   
</b>   It's Randy standing outside the newsvan with the
   cellular phone to his ear.
<b>   
</b>   CLICK! Another monitor turns on. It's of a man and
   woman back to the camera. The couple move in frame. It
   becomes apparent quick. It's Gale and Dewey. As they
   stand in the room - live. They're being taped.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Shit!
<b>   
</b>   Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer
   carries.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             Dammit!
<b>   
</b>   He looks around the room, up to the two levels above
   them. He spots a small light on the second level. He
   squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Let's go.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             No, wait here.
<b>   
</b>   Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the
   stair rise that leads to the upper level.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             No, Dewey, let's call for backup.
<b>   
</b>   But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the
   monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON THE UPPER LEVEL
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge.
   He approaches the railing and makes his way around to
   the shining light.
<b>   
</b>   He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod.
   It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the
   second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare.
<b>   
</b>   Dewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks
   up to him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Dewey?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             There's nothing. I'm coming down.
<b>   
</b>   Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that
   hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is
   in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained.
   She takes a step forward, moving out of frame,
   revealing
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   THE GHOST
</b><b>   
</b>   Who stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see
   the Ghost standing directly behind Gale.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Watch out!
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DOWN BELOW
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's
   knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults,
   just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle
   of seats.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   UP ABOVE
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his
   handicapped leg will allow.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DOWN BELOW
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind
   her.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   AT THE LECTURN
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Gale!
<b>   
</b>   He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes. He moves for
   it.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door.
   She tears it open, disappearing into...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. SOUND STAGE - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale finds herself in the student studios. She stands
   in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage.
   Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality.
<b>   
</b>   Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room.
   Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening
   as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are
   heard, making their way towards her.
<b>   
</b>   Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a
   sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   GHOST FIGURE
</b><b>   
</b>   That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS.
   She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the
   control booth. She's protected by a clear, large,
   plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost
   moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears
   out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying
   to secure it. There's no lock.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   AT THE MAIN DOOR
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be
   quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he
   immediately spots Gale.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale looks for objects to block the door with. She
   drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey moves to the window.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEWEY
</b>             Gale! Gale!
<b>   
</b>   She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS
   against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale shoves everything she can find against the door,
   not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the
   sound proof barrier behind her.
<b>   
</b>   She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind
   Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is
   terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see
   Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled
   into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is
   splattered against the glass.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE CONTROL BOOTH
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off
   guard. He falls forward onto the control panels.
   Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios
   as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE DUBBING STAGE
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.
<b>   
</b>   Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed
   against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves
   to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment
   as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes
   reveal it.
<b>   
</b>   Gale BEATS against the glass window.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>                   (through tears)
<b>             NOOOOOOO!
</b><b>   
</b>   Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is
   mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made
   his way through the control booth. He's coming for her.
   She races to the door, throws the things away.
<b>   
</b>   She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide
   through. And she's off and running.
<b>   
</b>   Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only
   long enough to lock it.
<b>   
</b>   BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it
   holds. Gale surveys her surroundings. She's in a
   storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through
   it and out into...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   THE HALLWAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale shoots down it.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               CUT TO:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. CAMPUS STREET - SECONDS LATER
</b><b>   
</b>   Sidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in
   sight. She reaches a corner, moves off the road and
   passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out
   onto...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. SORORITY ROW - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   The houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta
   Zeta House stares at Sidney. Lights burn from within.
   Sid goes for it.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. DELTA ZETA FRONT PORCH - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the
   front door, SCREAMING her lungs out.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b><b>             SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound
   porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody
   is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A
   WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying,
   strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.
<b>   
</b>   Sid runs to them.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Oh God, help me. We have to call
             the police.
<b>   
</b>   Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open
   and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has
   no comprehension skills at all.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Do you have keys? I need to get
             inside.
<b>   
</b>   Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Shit!
<b>   
</b>   Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves
   them, moving down off the porch and around to the back
   of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's
   locked too.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots
   a big tree with a...
<b>   
</b>   BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She
   moves toward it.
<b>   
</b>   As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He
   lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still
   chained to the tree.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Mickey? Mickey?
<b>   
</b>   A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there
   very much dead.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Oh God, no, Mickey...
<b>   
</b>   She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up,
   rising. Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried
   funk, his eyes wide.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've
             been here all night.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Listen to me. We've got to get
             help. The Killer's here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             What are you talking about?
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             He's after me.
<b>   
</b>   Mickey pulls on his chained arm.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             Shit! You've got to cut me down,
             Sid.
<b>   
</b>   Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             I'll be right back.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             Where you going?
<b>   
</b>   Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage.
   Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid
   settles on a shovel.
<b>   
</b>   Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's
   pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Watch out.
<b>   
</b>   Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on
   the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             Do it again.
<b>   
</b>   CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around
   peering into the night.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY (CONT'D)
</b>             What was that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Don't panic.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings
   it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening
   it.
<b>   
</b>   Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Watch out.
<b>   
</b>   Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't
   see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the
   tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and
   gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid.
<b>   
</b>   Mickey looks up, just in time.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b><b>             SIDNEYWATCHOUT!
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready.
   Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost,
   catching his mid-section, sending him flying.
<b>   
</b>   Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls,
   twists, squirms... anything to free himself.
<b>   
</b>   The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Hey.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost
   following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting
   across the yard, running smack into...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   THE GHOST MASKED KILLER
</b><b>   
</b>   But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each
   side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two
   Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but
   they counter, keeping her surrounded.
<b>   
</b>   Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife.
   She turns to the other. His knife is already poised.
   They close in on her, ready to strike.
<b>   
</b>   She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM!
<b>   
</b>   Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the
   Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MICKEY
</b>             Run, Sid...
<b>   
</b>   Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards
   the front of the yard.
<b>   
</b>   Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him.
   He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't
   know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...
   she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around
   just in time to see...
<b>   
</b>   Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're
   knives strike at the same time. One through the
   stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw
   their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily
   hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the
   ground.
<b>   
</b>   Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off
   running, along the side of the house, through a row of
   shrub that take her to...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. STREET - SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid is back on the campus street, running down the
   middle of it.
<b>   
</b>   She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up.
   KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and
   SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet
   pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the
   car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.
<b>   
</b>   She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The
   theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone
   entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Hallie?
<b>   
</b>   But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.

   goes for it.
<b>

   button.
<b>   
</b><b>                       VOICE

   looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side

<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b><b>             SIDNEY!

</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. THEATRE SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge
   proscenium stage.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on
   it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way
   down the aisle toward the orchestra section.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Hello?
<b>   
</b>   The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the
   furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from
   the stage wings.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Hallie?
<b>   
</b>   Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that
   extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and
   moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either
   side of her.
<b>   
</b>   Complete darkness.
<b>   
</b><b>   DRIP! DRIP!
</b><b>   
</b>   Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She
   wipes it from her face when...
<b>   
</b>   CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the
   house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at
   this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in
   crimson. Then out to the house... the light is
   blinding.
<b>   
</b>   CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid
   looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She
   leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.
<b>   
</b>   The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back
   wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and
   antique weapons and...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DEWEY
</b><b>   
</b>   Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very
   much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a
   bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen
   in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.
   She breaks into tears. And then...
<b>   
</b>   Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when
   another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,
   trapping her. She looks in shock at...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   HALLIE
</b><b>   
</b>   Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,
   turning, running to the other side of the stage when a
   third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled
   set of DEATHTRAP.
<b>   
</b>   Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood
   everywhere. And then, Sid hears...
<b>   
</b><b>   CLAPPING!
</b><b>   
</b>   A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...
   applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving
   down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
<b>   
</b>   Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near
   Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to
   find...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.
   And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his
   arms and legs bound by electric tape.
<b>   
</b>   Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is
   now walking across the bridge, holding something... a
   light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.
   Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with
   pleading eyes.
<b>   
</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             Quick, untie me.
<b>   
</b>   Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans
   down to untie him but stops.
<b>   
</b><b>                       VOICE

</b>   He smiles at her.

</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             Sid, c'mon.
<b>   
</b>   Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either
   one of them. Derek watches her, amused.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK

<b>

<b>   
</b>   Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall
   where Hallie hangs.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK (CONT'D)
</b>             Sidney, you can't keep your back to

</b>             You're really stumped, aren't you?
             You know there's two killers but
             you don't know who they are. I'm a
             given. The boyfriend. Way obvious.
             But now you're torn. Everyone else
             appears to be dead. Except for
             Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?
<b>   
</b>   Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching
   out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find
   Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much
   alive.

<b>   
</b>   Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself
   down from the wall with a big hunting knife.

</b>   Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   THE CURTAIN DROPS
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the
   curtain separates them.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ON STAGE
</b><b>   
</b>   Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her
   throat.
<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             It's about time she showed up.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   IN THE AUDITORIUM
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale moves to the exit door and into the...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. STAIR WELL SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale eyes a door that's marked "STAGE DOOR". She opens
   it and steps in coming face to face with a...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   A LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER
</b><b>   
</b>   Gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find...
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             standing, lips pursed.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for
             you.
<b>   
</b>   Gale's face is a mass of confusion.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. STAGE SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her
   knees, next to Cotton.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSE ON COTTON'S HAND
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Okay, look, you guys - I applaud
             your methodical expertise but I
             have a question. What's going to
             happen after I die? I thought the
             heroine is supposed to live.
<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             Not this time.
<b>   
</b>   Hallie moves in on her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             Yeah, we're trying to send a
             message to Hollywood. I'm really
             getting tired of all the happy
             endings. It's just not reality. In
             the real world the good guys die,
             the innocent are punished, and the
             murderers inherit the earth.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             But nobody wants to see that. It'll
             never go. They'll rewrite you. You
             don't want that.
<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate.
             I guess fearing death makes one
             anxious.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             You fucking freaked out movie nut
             psychos...
<b>   
</b><b>                       VOICE
</b>                   (off camera)
             Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies
             don't create pyschos.
<b>   
</b>   Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her
   very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all
   turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in
   hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He
   doesn't want to miss a second.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Don't you know that by now? It's
             about family. It all starts at
             home. It starts with the father...
             and the mother.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to
   Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Mrs. Loomis?
<b>   
</b>   Gale stops cold.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             What?
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Oh my God.
<b>   
</b>   Gale turns to Debbie Salt.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Jesus. It can't be.
<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             Told you we had a guest star.
             Didn't see that coming, did you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             Everything's taken on a hyper-
             reality, hasn't it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             You're Billy's mother?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             I couldn't believe you didn't
             recognize me. You even interviewed
             me for your book.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             You're all in this together?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             We had to have financing.
<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             Tuition's expensive.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Why Mrs. Loomis?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Where should we start? Your mother
             ruined my marriage by sleeping with
             my husband. You ruined my family by
             killing my son. Gale aired it to
             the world. Should I go on... isn't
             that enough?
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Jesus, you're just as whacked as
             your son.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Where do you think he got it?
             Mental illness is heriditary. Who
             do you think incouraged him to kill
             your mother? He was a smart kid but
             children need parental guidance.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney is completely horror stricken. She stands in
   total disbelief.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             Yeah, she's been great, Sid. We
             never would have been able to it
             without her.
<b>   
</b>   Debbie Salt/Mrs. Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie,
   smiling.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             And I couldn't have done it without
             you two. Now who won the coin toss?
<b>   
</b>   Hallie raises her hand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       HALLIE
</b>             I did.
<b>   
</b>   Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply... and
   FIRES. Sid and Gale SCREAM as a bullet through the
   forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat
   wall. Her body drops to the floor. Dead.
<b>   
</b>   Derek drops the camera, completely taken back. He looks
   to Debbie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEREK
</b>             What are you...
<b>   
</b>   Debbie turns the gun on him. FIRES AGAIN. Derek moves,
   the bullet catches him in the stomach. He drops to his
   knees. Debbie FIRES again. Derek takes another bullet.
   This time dropping. Very dead. His body falls near
   Cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this
   ordeal. He eyes Derek's knife that now lay near his
   wrists.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SIDNEY AND GALE
</b><b>   
</b>   Turn to Debbie in complete horror.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Nice kids but a little out there.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             What are you going to do?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Finish what my son started.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             But you'll never get away with it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Enter Cotton Weary.
<b>   
</b>   Cotton looks up.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT (CONT'D)
</b>             Think about it. An innocent man
             wrongly accused. Spends time in
             prison where he justs sits with his
             righteous anger, waiting, planning
             his revenge. His life so
             incomprehensively ruined he's
             forced to take revenge on the
             people responsible. It's perfect.
<b>   
</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             No... not again.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were
             just meant to be a killer.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             You'll never get away with this.
<b>   
</b>   Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DEBBIE SALT
</b>             Who would you like to shoot first,
             Cotton?
<b>   
</b>   Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings.
   With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt. It
   strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back.
   Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. She
   goes down. Dead.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Thank God.
<b>   
</b>   Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She
   helps him with the last of his bindings. Sid looks
   about at the body count on stage. It's mounting. She
   takes a deep breath. Relieved.
<b>   
</b><b>                       GALE (CONT'D)
</b>             God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm
             so sorry.
<b>   
</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             Yeah...
<b>   
</b>   Gale gives him a hug.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSE ON COTTON'S FACE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       GALE
</b>             Thank you.
<b>   
</b>   He hugs her back. She doesn't see as he rises the knife
   behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal
   move. Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she
   goes limp as the knife lodges in her back.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's
   body down into the orchestra pit. He turns, facing
   Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b><b>             NOOO!
</b><b>   
</b>   Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera
   lay, he pulls the tape from it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             It's perfect, Sidney. No one will
             ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm
             the victim.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             Please, Cotton, don't do this.
<b>   
</b>   He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.
<b>   
</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             I get my revenge and make some fast
             cash.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>             It's over, Cotton.
<b>   
</b><b>                       COTTON
</b>             Not until you're dead.
<b>   
</b>   Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through
   the set door to...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACKSTAGE
</b><b>   
</b>   Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the
   narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back
   wail. She races down it.
<b>   
</b>   She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE
<b>   SCRIM!
</b><b>   
</b>   Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage
   door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder
   that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk
   above.
<b>   
</b>   Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with
   lightning speed.
<b>   
</b>   Cotton, up and running, is close behind.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. CATWALK SAME
</b><b>   
</b>   The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats
   and a large chandelier are stored in the air.
<b>   
</b>   Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the
   ending.
<b>   
</b><b>   AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.
</b><b>   
</b><b>   WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE
</b><b>   CHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLY
</b><b>   RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND
</b><b>   STABS COTTON.
</b><b>   
</b><b>   HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH
</b><b>   OTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXT
</b><b>   TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY
</b><b>   CLOSE.
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   THE END (FOR NOW)
</b>
