<b>          1 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 1
</b>
          From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell
          fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns.
          Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window,
          lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes.
          He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if
          he might run back into the flames. But the heat is
          unbearable. He runs toward us then past us through black
          shadows. We cannot see his face,

</b>
           Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun.
           A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes!

<b>          2 EXT. YARD - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 2
</b>
           The rock thrower, TOM ( 10) is hightailing it away from an
          isolated Appalachian SHACK as the door bangs open, a shotgun
          barrel appears, and a chicken comes SQUAWKING out from under
          the porch!
          Thinking he's sure to be shot, Tom runs into the old barn!

<b>          3 INT. BUSH'S BARN - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 3
</b>
          Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light,
          trying to see through the cracks. There is a loud SNORT and
          the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his
          shoulder.
          Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the
          barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him!
          Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up!
          When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a
          fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a
          handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then
          takes it and wipes his mouth.
          Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the
          boy will never forget before waving him away.

<b>          4 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 4
</b>
          Looking back over his shoulder, Tom runs for the road. Two of
          his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust.
          BUSH (72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with
          a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper.

<b>          5 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 5
</b>
          Bush enters the barn to check on his companion. MULE is older
          than Bush in mule years and just as gray. He wears an old
          mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets
          nervously from all the excitement. Bush comforts him.

<b>                         BUS H
</b>          Just a boy, that's all.

<b>                         6 SERIES: 6
</b>          7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7
          fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'. Bush checks
          the road in both directions. All clear for now.
          8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8
          dozes in the shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn
          into his road, right past his new sign. He glances at his
          shotgun leaning against the shack.
          The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees
          Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Mornin', sir.

</b>          Pardon? I'm uh, Reverend Gus
          Horton, sir, how you doing?
          Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton.

<b>                         HORTON

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Yeah, well..
          Bush returns to chopping wood.
          Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Mr. Starke told me that you and him
          ran away from home when you were 6
          years old. Is that true?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I talked him into it.
          Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Well.. anyway.. I.. alright..
          Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves.
           Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying.

<b>          9 EXT. CEMETERY - EVENING 9
</b>
          The loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by Wiley
          Starke's fresh grave. The mounded earth is covered with
          beautiful flowers and wreathes, a loving send off from his
          family and friends. As we pan past the flowers and cards..
          we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty.
          Hunkered down nearby, Bush is as still as a gravestone,
          staring at the last resting place of his old friend.
          As Bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands frozen,
          staring at a pot of YELLOW FLOWERS on a distant grave. Now he
          turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction.

<b>          10 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 10
</b>
          Rain drums hard on the tin roof as Bush, soaked to the bone
          and shaking with chills, rummages through an old hat box by
          lamp light: Letters, news clippings and keepsakes. He finds
          what he's looking for: A PICTURE of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.
          She smiles at us from happier days. Realizing that he is
          raging with a serious fever, he tries to stand up only to
          collapse back on the bed.

<b>          14 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 14
</b>
          Wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp, Bush moves
          slowly toward the barn. But he is so wracked with fever he
          has to stop. It stuns him that he can't go on. He never
          thought anything could stop him. Stuck in the rain with the
          shaking lamp sizzling, he stares into the forever darkness,
          the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Well hell..

<b>          15 INT. BUSH'S BARN - NIGHT 15
</b>
          Somehow he has made it. Sopping wet and shivering, Bush is in
          bad shape and knows it.
          Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises.
          Bush blindly pours Mule some feed and the poor old thing
          snatches his first meal in days.
          Bush tries to think through the fever. He stumbles back to
          the door and swings it wide open so Mule can get out if Bush
          doesn't make it. Satisfied, he comes back and drops hard onto
          a pile of hay near Mule.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Always thought you'd go first..
          White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running
          out of oil, the light fading fast to darkness. Thoughts
          tumble through his mind, troubling him, stirring the dark
          waters of memory.

</b>
          PAN across the stillness of the foothills to the barn. The
          door is still swung wide open.
          Back from the brink of death, Bush emerges into the blinding
          sunlight. Mule is dozing in his favorite spot. He swings his
          big gray head over at Bush.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Ahh, don't look so disappointed.

</b>
          Mule watches Bush heave a creaky old wagon out from behind
          the barn. Mule climbs up on all fours. Bush gets a set of
          reins and walks toward him. Mule starts to take a stroll,
          knowing what the reins mean.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          You better not.
          Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          And coffee when we get there.

<b>          19 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 19
</b>
          Old wheels creak and moan. Bush and Mule ease up Main street
          with the cart. PEOPLE try to catch a glimpse of the infamous
          recluse.
          Mule comes to a wearied stop, breathing hard. Bush climbs off
          the cart and walks Mule, ignoring the eyes upon him.

          Reverend Horton, stoking the wood stove, hears FOOTSTEPS.

<b>          6.
</b>          But as he turns he sees Bush silently looking around.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Oh! Hello..
          Horton comes to Bush but Bush ignores him and keeps
          critically looking around.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          What can I do for you, sir?
          Suddenly BUDDY and KATHRYN ROBINSON (20's) enter from the
          vestibule with their new BABY. In their own world, and not
          realizing that there is anyone in the chapel, Kathryn picks
          some lint from Buddy's jacket. He catches her fingers and
          kisses them.
          Bush is transfixed by the loving moment.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I can wait.
          Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush. Buddy nods
          to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into the vestibule to
          give Bush and Horton privacy.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          It's alright, have a seat.
          Bush sits down uneasily in a pew. Horton sits down in the pew
          in front of him and twists around to face him. The wintry
          light from the near window washes over them.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          What's on your mind, sir?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Down to business
          Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of
          MONEY on the pew. Horton's eyes bulge.

<b>                         BUSH

          Horton looks up from the money.

          Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as
          hell, until Kathryn pulls him back.

<b>                          HORTON
</b>           For you?

          Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing
          at the baby. Buddy lingers, staring at Bush, thinking..

<b>          21 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 21
</b>
          Bush's wagon loaded with bags of feed and supplies, sits in
          front of the Diner.
          Bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for Mule who is
          drinking it and loving it.
          Tom (the kid who threw the rock) comes from behind the diner
          with a full garbage can to empty into the big trash barrels
          on the back of an old pick-up truck. He sees Bush and
          freezes.
          Bush looks up and stares at him.
          The diner door snaps open and BONNIE (30's), Tom's mother,
          steps out. She sees Tom and Bush staring at each other.

<b>                         BONNIE
</b>          What are you doing, son?
          Now Tom is scared to death that Bush is going to tell on him.
          Bonnie doesn't like this staring match at all.

          truck and get back in here. Now.
          Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the hook.
          Relieved, Tom heaves the can up into the truck. Bonnie
          hesitates then goes back into the diner just as...
          .CARL (30s), his sidekick, GARY, and two other MEN come
          across the street toward the diner. Gary sees Mule slurping
          coffee from the big tin cup.

<b>                         GARY
</b>          Look at that. A mule drinking
          coffee!

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Finally found somebody that likes
          Bonnie's coffee.
          As they move past, they see Bush standing there..

<b>                         WORKER
</b>          Ya'll better hush, that's old Bush.
          Carl eyes him. Gary and the others throw curious glances as
          they head into the diner. Carl stops.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Hey..

<b>                         (NO RESPONSE)
</b>          I'm talking to you..
          Carl picks up a handful of gravel, tosses some over
          nonchalantly in Bush's direction. Bush ignores it.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          We know about you. You stay out of
          this diner. There's women and
          children here and we don't want you
          around them.
          Bush stands to mount up, never turning around.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          You better hear me. I see you here
          again, I'll.. Hey! Hey!
          Hearing the hollering, Tom looks up from the pick-up.
          Carl throws a stone, harder this time to get Bush's
          attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          11.
</b>          But the rock misses Bush and hits Mule, startling him. Old
          instincts kick in and he has a VIOLENT FIT.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          Shit..
          Carl moves up to try and calm him..
          .as Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a
          GASH in Mule's hind-quarter. Mule whinnies painfully, slowly
          surrendering.
          As Carl steps up, Bush yanks the BRAKE HANDLE off the cart
          and hits Carl in the chest. Air explodes from Carl as he
          gasps with pain. Before he can move, Bush hits him again in
          the same place. Carl wants to hit back but he has no air.
          Lightning quick, Bush steps back and hits Carl again in the
          exact same place.
          Carl falls like a bag of bones. He looks up and sees Bush
          towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in him.
          It has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to
          Carl.

<b>                         TOM
</b>          Daddy!
          Wild with fear, Bonnie and Tom run toward Bush.

<b>                         BONNIE
</b>          Stop it!! Get away!
          Gary, the Worker burst from the diner but see the brake
          handle in Bush's hand and slow down.
          Bush comes to himself, sees everyone staring, sees Carl in
          tears, and now Tom and Bonnie, trying to get him away..
          Gary and the others slowly move toward Bush. More patrons
          step out from the diner.
          Buddy races up, sees Mule bleeding, and eyes Bush as he grabs
          the reins and leads Mule down Main street, still holding the
          brake handle.

          Tom stares after Bush, mirroring his father's hatred.

          An EMPTY CASKET, awaits its passenger in a small but
          serviceable funeral hall. Through the office door, FRANK
          QUINN sits at his desk, his head completely buried behind a
          paper that he shakes hard every few seconds. His feet are up
          on the desk revealing a pair of lovely burgundy silk socks.

           Frank's hand slips the flask next to his coffee cup into a

           remains hidden as Buddy enters. Buddy is troubled by the

          and knocks a little louder. Nothing. He inches to the window
          and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to
          slide away..

          In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous
          carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and
          long face that are being born from the rough block. It makes
          him smile. But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole
          through him.

          It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops
          eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that
          he's been dismissed.

          Buddy heads to the hearse, glancing back over his shoulder.
          As he recalls his encounter, he stops, looking back at the
          shack. The old legend has gotten deep under his skin.

          Bush is on the porch, straining boiled herbs, grass, and bark
          into a jar. There is something not right with him and he
          knows it. While the medicine cools he looks out across the

          As Bush shakes Frank's hand, he stares into him, taking
          everything in, his bloodshot eyes, the wrinkled shirt beneath
          his suit, his breath. Frank feels downright naked.

          They are together but in very different worlds. They don't
          even look at each other when they talk.
          Buddy is lost in serious thought.
          Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast.
          Bush is scrunched up to the door. He is going much faster
          than he is used to going. He kinda likes it and kinda
          doesn't.

          (to Bush but almost to

<b>                         HIMSELF)
</b>          I was thinking about your funeral
          party before I went to sleep last
          night and I think I understand it a
          little now. When I was a kid, my
          folks where killed in a bad car
          wreck and the people at the funeral
          home... they did the impossible as
          far as I was concerned. I don't
          know what I would've done without
          them. And I remember wishing that
          my mother and daddy were there to
          see how beautiful they made
          everything.
          Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush
          glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at the
          world rushing by too fast. All at once he gives in to it.

          Bush is seated in front of a backdrop painted with a bridge,
          a swan, and a pond. The Photographer is trying to tidy up
          Bush without offending him. As he walks back to camera, Bush
          roughs himself up and looks truly wild.

          Mr. Tollerude, nervous as hell, brings Bush up from his
          reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror.
          Bush studies his well trimmed hair and beard for a moment.
          It's impossible to tell what his thoughts are as he looks
          into his own eyes.

          Frank is quietly trying to get Mr. Feldman to lower the price
          for the suit. He looks over and double-takes Bush.

</b>          I would have turned down your loan
          if you were my own dear mother,
          Frank.

          You're worse than two old women..
           Ray shrugs, sweetly blase. Frank tries to rein in his temper
           for her. The loss of the hand is especially hard on Carl who
          has only a couple of dollars left.

          funeral. What can I say? I'd like
          to be at my funeral so I could tell

</b>          He came to see me, wanting a
          funeral, had a big old greasy ball
          of money. Talked like he thought he

          Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is
          suddenly truly concerned.

          Horton shrugs. Frank notes the concern and doesn't like it.
          Carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat.

<b>                         CARL
</b>          I'll tell you one damn thing, ain't
          nobody gonna go to a funeral for

          You could tell about him kicking
          your ass, Carl.

          This is not about cards. It's a declaration meant to
          embarrass Frank in front of everyone. Frank feels their eyes
          on him as he starts to pull off his watch. Ray waves it off.

<b>                         RAY

          day he would've killed me. And I

          his first time.
          It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie.

</b>          Everybody knows you started it.
          (off his glare)
          Don't look at me like that. I
          remember when you were born. You
          were the sweetest little boy. What
          is wrong with you?
          Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a
          better man there. He struggles to hold on to it but..

<b>                         CARL
</b>          I made a mistake. But there's a
          line.. and he crossed it.. and
          everybody knows that too. Ya'll go
          on and have a party with the devil
          for his money but I'll dance on his
          grave someday.
          Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out.

          it comes to Carl but he's got a
          point. You don't know what Bush is

          everybody in one place so he can
          turn his shotgun on them?

          Even at the bank, you loan people
          just enough to get'em deeper in so
          you can foreclose on them.

          (a deep dark look)
          Stand up or I'll stand you up.
           Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is
           irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank's chair
          scraping the floor makes him jerk up.

          I slept on the same side of the bed
          my whole life, right? But after my
          wife left me, I switched sides,
          just like that, and never been able

          control booth.(We will cut back and forth between the glass)
          Buddy is having misgivings about being here. But Frank gives
          the thumbs up to the young WCGM ANNOUNCER in the booth, a
          hopeful kid with a smooth voice and dreams of the big-time.
          The Announcer hands Bush a set of headphones. Bush is wearing
          his new clothes and truly looks like a different man.
          Bush is puzzled by the headset. The kid takes it and clamps
          it onto Bush's head. He starts to yank them off then hears a
          song playing inside his head and loves it. But now the
          announcer cuts the record off and Bush scowls.

          that everyone is talking about. And
          here he is, Mr. Felix Bush, the
          mysterious hermit of Caleb County!
          How are you today, sir?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I am.
          Bush is surprised by the sound of his own voice.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          So tell us, sir, exactly how did
          you come up with the idea of having
          a funeral party before you die?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I dreamed it.

</b>          Really?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Why would I make that up?
          Two seconds of dead air as the announcer finds his feet.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          Okay. Now I have to say that you
          don't look quite like you do on the
          posters.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          I got pruned.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          Well, you're a bit of a local
          legend, sir. I was a little nervous
          about our interview. I've heard
          some pretty wild stories..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Like what?

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          Well uh, just.. from what I
          understand, you want everyone who
          has a story about you to come and
          tell it. Is that right?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          You come and tell yours.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          Thank you. Now how long have you
          been living out there by yourself?

          Mattie is cutting the stems of some lovely yellow flowers and
          arranging them in a vase.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          But why would you do that, Mr.
          Bush, shut yourself off like that?
          Frank isn't happy with this but Buddy wants to hear.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Come to the funeral and maybe
          you'll find out.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          You heard it here on WCGM, folks,
          find out the answer to the mystery
          February 16..

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          One more thing, boy.
          FRANK and Buddy tense. What's this?

<b>          66 INT. DARROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 6 6
</b>
          Mattie tenses at the sound in Bush's voice.

<b>          BUSH (O.S.)
</b>          Gonna be a drawing.

<b>           ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
</b>           What kind of drawing, sir?

<b>                          BUSH
</b>           You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day
           of the funeral we draw names. Then
           when I die, the winner gets my
           place, 300 acres of timber that
           hasn't been touched in 40 years.
           Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower.

<b>          67 INT. WCGM - SAME 67
</b>
           Dead air. The kid, Frank, and Buddy are all staring at Bush.

<b>                          ANNOUNCER
</b>          For 5 dollars?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home.
          Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost
          yelps! Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad.

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          You heard him! If you want a chance
          to win 300 acres of virgin timber
          worth thousands and thousands of
          dollars, send 5 dollars along with
          your name and address to..
          (off Frank waving and
          pointing to himself)
          Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home.
          As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head in time
          with the music. Frank and Buddy rush into the control booth.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>
<b>                         (TO BUSH)

<b>                         ANNOUNCER
</b>          I'll take a ticket.

<b>                         BUDDY

</b>          Hey, it's his idea!
          They look at Bush who has taken off the headset and looking
          at it like he wants to take it home.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          It's what you want, right?

          Mattie puts the vase of flowers on table with a group of
          family photographs. The picture beside the vase is the SAME
          PHOTOGRAPH of the beautiful woman that Bush has. Is it
          Mattie? It looks a little like her.

<b>          70 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - LATE DAY 70
</b>
          Bush starts out of the barn, draws back, and peeks through
          the wall boards: A FIGURE approaches. He jerks..
          REVEAL Mattie walking

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Mattie?

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Felix?
          Mattie enters, straining to see into the barn. Her eyes
          adjust to find him standing near Mule. She is startled and
          pleased by his new do.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Look at you. I wondered if you were
          still under that beard.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Wasn't nowhere else to go.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          I heard you on the radio.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Well.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          You've gotten downright chatty.

</b>
<b>                         (GLANCING AROUND)
</b>          This is nice. I drove by a few
          times after I got back but..

<b>                         BUSH

<b>          71 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY 71
</b>
          The first stop on the tour is a small fenced grave site near
          the shack. Three grave markers with names carved into them:

<b>          KEEPER, CHARLIE, MAUDE.
</b>          Bush is squatting down staring at the markers. Mattie stands
          close beside him. Since his attention is elsewhere she looks
          at him in an unguarded way. Her mind is full of questions,
          old and new.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          You always know where you stand
          with a dog. Want to lay here with
          them someday if they'll have me.

                          

<b>          72 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY/LATER 72
</b>
          Mattie and Bush walks side by side through the last of the
          glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees. It is a
          chilly and Mattie's cheeks are flushed. She is enchanted by
          the place. Bush tries to hide how winded he is..

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          It really is beautiful. Probably
          looked like this everywhere a
          hundred years ago.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          You leave things alone, they know
          what to do.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Like you?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          No, Ma'am. I don't know what to do
          about anything much.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          You've been alone a long time.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Some people are more suited to it
          than others, I reckon.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          46A.
</b>
<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          That's funny cause I never thought
          that it'd suit you. I knew you
          wouldn't be like anybody else but..
          no one to talk to, no one to.. be
          with.. never.
          He looks into her then looks away at something.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          How you sleeping these days, girl?

<b>                         MATTIE

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          No, not lately. How'd you know?
           He veers off the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back
           to her.

<b>                          BUSH
</b>           Chamomile, it's good when the 
           nights get long. Helps you nod off.
           She takes it and smiles up at him.

<b>                          BUSH 
</b>           Want to go on a ways? 

<b>                          MATTIE

<b>                          MATTIE

<b>                          MATTIE

          They enter the dark room together. Bush lights a lantern,
          gets a chair from a corner and holds it out for her. She sits
          and watches him check a cast iron pot on the warm stove and
          put a log on the fire. She notices the beautiful table.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          You always were good with your
          hands.

<b>                         BUSH

          And you went right on in the dark?
          I hear that song sometimes at
          night.

          But suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong
           ropes. She stares at the wall as she walks toward Bush's bed.
          Bush is stricken and white. He would stop her if he could but
          it is too late.
          She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp
          light and stares into it as if it is a mirage that will
          disappear if she blinks.
          Finally she whirls and looks at him, her face a tortured
          mask. A strangled sob escapes her.
          He gets up and stands there staring at the floor.
          Suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out
          the door. Her shadow merges with the darkness. Bush stands
          with his head down, staring into oblivion.

          Buddy comes in frowning and lugging a heavy mail sack. What
          the hell? He looks up and sees more sacks dumped on the desk.
          Frank is grinning and ripping open envelopes from the sacks
          and each one has 5 dollars in it! Buddy looks down and sees
          even more mail sacks on the floor!

          Buddy quietly creeps in through the front door, looks back
          over his shoulder, scowls, and enters the church.
          93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93
          sanctuary.
          Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door
          behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window
          at the driveway, and then at Buddy.

          Frank enters with a flashlight. He sees that his desk and
          files have been ransacked. He rushes into the casket room.
          Several caskets have been thrown to the floor. He goes to the
          one where the money is, finds that it is sealed tight, and
          sighs with relief. Hearing something he whips the light
          around and sees Buddy on the floor.

           Frank examines a cut and bump on top of Buddy's head by

          Mattie sits beside a fire, knitting a baby blanket by an oil
          lamp. All at once the lights sputter on, the radio lights up,
          warms, and begins to PLAY, as a KNOCK at the door..

          Mattie pulls the door open. Bush is standing there soaking
          wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun. She draws back
          reflexively. He looks into her.

          Bush stands with a towel around him, shivering.
          Mattie opens a dresser drawer. Inside the drawer, is the
          carefully arranged tableau of a watch, a ring, a stethoscope,
          and some clothes. She hates to disturb the drawer but pulls
          out a pair of black pants and a white shirt, lays them on the
          bed, and walks out.

          Mattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as Bush
          comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose.
          Still shivering, Bush steps uneasily in front of the fire.
          Mattie hands him the hot mug. He looks uneasily at the yellow
          flowers on the table nearby.

          Mattie tries to absorb that. The truth and tragedy of it
          touches her in way that she is not prepared for. They sit
          there in silence. She suddenly wipes her face and scowls.

          leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all
          over him. He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles
          up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back. It's
          not the weight, something is wrong. Sweat pops out on his
          forehead. He forces himself to the casket and drops the top
          down hard, staggers back against the loft ladder, slides down

          his hand on his shoulder.

          Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the
          microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing.
          Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath, and walks up
          to it, and looks out over the huge crowd.

          down, sees Buddy, Kathryn, Frank and Horton.
          He looks closer for someone most important but she is not
          there. The crowd murmurs. Finally..

          so I could get forgiveness. But I
          didn't want forgiveness.

          completely.

          suddenly SEES HER coming through the crowd.

          changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred.
          The look takes Bush's breath away. But he suddenly seems to
          accept it as his due and when he talks, it is only to her.

<b>                         BUSH

          Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush talking
          just to her.

<b>                         BUSH

<b>                         BUSH

          The big funeral party breaks up people wind their way home.
          The big old honking generator coughs off.
          Mule is lead back to the barn.
          The equipment is disassembled and loaded back on the truck.
          The microphone stands alone on the stage. He got it said.

<b>          167 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 167
</b>
          Buddy, Frank, Horton, Charlie, and Kathryn and the baby wait
          outside, giving Bush and Mattie time. Buddy takes the baby
          and holds it close.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          99.
</b>          Finally Mattie and Bush come out of the shack and walk down
          to the others. No one knows what to say. Finally..

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          How you doing, sir?

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Just fair, son.

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Carl said Ray paid them to set the
          fire. Paid them to break into the
          funeral home too.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Can't stop pulling Aces out of his
          ass, can he?

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Spend his money on lawyers now. You
          know how thrifty they are.
          Frank motions to Buddy and they go to Bush. Buddy is still
          holding the baby, Bush looks tenderly at Buddy and the baby.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          What's his name?

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Larry, Lawrence, after my dad, sir.

<b>                         BUSH

</b>          Not if knows what's good for him.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          You boys did good. Real good.
          Let's settle up.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          We don't have to do that now. You
          get some rest.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          (a look/ then)
          Yeah. We'll come out tomorrow.

<b>                         BUSH

          broke in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          100.
</b>          Bush pulls Buddy aside. Frank stares over at them but can't
          hear what they are saying. He moves over beside Mattie.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          Are you alright, Mattie?
          She looks up at Frank for a long moment, her face softening.

<b>                         MATTIE
</b>          Oh, I don't know. I'm still moving,
          I guess..
          He doesn't know what that means but she has finally really
          looked at him and that's something he'll hold onto.
          Kathryn comes and hugs Mattie as.. Bush and Buddy come back.
          Bush goes to Charlie.
          Frank is staring at Buddy, looking for a clue as to what Bush
          said. Buddy gives him nothing,

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Thanks again for coming, Charlie.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I'm proud of you.

<b>                         (MEANING IT)
</b>          Thank you for my church.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>          Did you ever get my bill?

<b>                         HORTON
</b>          Can we get a ride our car's about 2
          miles down the road.
          Everyone piles into the hearse. There is no back seat so they
          all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides.
          It makes everyone smile. Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting
          embrace then climbs in. Bush looks in on them all for a long
          moment all then closes the door.
          As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out
          the back window. Buddy waves back.

<b>                         BUSH
</b>
<b>                         (TO HIMSELF)
</b>          Look at that. My funeral and
          everybody's in there but me.
          The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away.

</b>          The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful. He looks down the
          road through the fading dust and sees a WOMAN walking slowly
          toward him. He squints, recognizes her, and his face fills
          with a timeless love.

<b>          168 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER 168
</b>
          It's a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree. Mule stands
          hitched to the wagon. The three dog grave markers are
          frosted.
          A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the
          tree. It is freshly carved with: Felix Elijah Bush. A pot of
          fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker.
          Bush's beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave.
          Frank, Mattie, Charlie, Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton stand
          beside the grave. Several MEN with shovels wait near the
          tree. Charlie's eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation
          which Bush would probably love.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Well, Felix, this one's for real, I
          guess. I didn't actually see them
          put you in the box so..
          Charlie glances over and notices "Charlie" on one of the
          dog's grave markers. He snorts and shakes his head.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Wherever you are, you're probably
          giving someone a hard time or
          something wonderful and priceless
          just to confuse them. Not
          everything can be figured out, nor
          everybody. I wish you peace from
          the burdens of your mind and heart.
          I wish it for us all.
          Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand
          out to catch her should she should stumble. She stares down
          at the FB on the coffin, opens her hand, and lets the picture
          of her sister drift down onto the coffin.

<b>          169 EXT. HILLSIDE - LATER 169
</b>
          Everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave. Buddy and
          Kathryn move up beside Frank and Mattie and Charlie. Buddy
          tosses the ball of hermit money to Frank.

</b>          A 50 on the outside, all ones
          inside. Less than $100.

<b>                         FRANK
</b>          What?!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I told you. Nobody listens to the
          preacher.
          Buddy pulls some papers from his coat.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          The day of the party he told me
          about the will he had in the secret
          drawer of his table. He left the
          raffle money to all of us.
          Everyone is shocked, touched.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>
<b>                         (TO FRANK)
</b>          But you have to pay for Mule's
          upkeep for the rest of his life.
          Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          And he set up a fund for the
          upkeep of your church.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          What's the catch?

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          No catch, sir.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Still don't get it, do you? With
          Felix, there's always a catch.

<b>                         BUDDY
</b>          Maybe he just knew you'd go crazy
          wondering what it was.
          They all laugh and move down the hillside. As the laughter
          fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has
          had upon them. Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but
          growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the
          pot of yellow flowers. His curiosity about the fearsome old
          man has not abated. Nor will it ever.
