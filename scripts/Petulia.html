<b>          1 ALLEY LOADING PLATFORM AND CORRIDOR OF FAIRMONT HOTEL
</b>
<b>          NIGHT
</b>          The story begins in this grubby alley, where two extra
          large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading
          platform. Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to
          see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors
          of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six
          perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile
          accidents are lifted into wheelchairs.
          The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos,
          the women in splendid evening dresses. One of the women
          wears a neck brace which forces her always to look
          skyward, so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage
          pinned to her bosom.
          Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the
          stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform,
          past great bales of laundry, past whatever horrors one
          finds behind the warm, smiling face of a hotel. Watch-
          men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the
          wheelchairs without much interest.
          Then doors swing open, and we are in the tram It of the
          grand ballroom.

<b>          2 INTO GRAND BALLROOM
</b>          It is a charity ball. The sign says "Shake for Highway
          Safety."' The wheelchairs and their occupants no longer
          interest us. They are the guests of honor, and people
          gather about them to arrange them appealingly, and we
          rush past the go-go band, the shakers, and the door
          prize, which is a little convertible, spinning endlessly
          on a pedestal.
          CAMERA reaches PETULIA, who is dancing with her husband,
          DAVID, but trying not to lose sight of ARCHIE. ARCHIE
          really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it
          too obvious. As he bends over to put his punch cup on
          a table, he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the
          guests of honor. He is not at all comfortable.

</b>          It's not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie;
          gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies
          get in the way, and the dance won't end. The music
          stops for a second, everyone sags and thinks, "Thank
          God it's over," but instantly the music begins again
          and everyone good naturedly swears, "Those crazy kids
          are trying to kill us," and meanwhile Petulia sees
          that Archie has reached the place where you get your
          coat.

<b>          MED. ARCHIE
</b>          He is searching through his pockets for the ticket
          that will let him reclaim his coat. All the coats
          are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical
          care of a debutante attendant.

<b>          PETULIA' S VOICE
</b>          You can't leave
          He turns and sees Petulia.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          You're an official host.
          She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with
          'Official Host' says Dr. A. Bollen. Archie takes the
          ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Careful. Can you tell I'm not wearing
          a brassiere?

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          No.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Don't think about it. It will only
          excite you.
          Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the
          attendant now tries to find. On through this Petulia
          continues.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Ahh ...

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          I've been married six months and I've
          never had an affair,

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          It can happen

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Don't take it so bloody well. I've just

<b>          MED. DAVID WITH HIS MOTHER AND FATHER
</b>          somewhere near the free whiskey table asking for Pernod,
          which, of course, they don't have.
          The father is watching the charity affair with utter
          disapproval. He tips a waiter by shoving a half-dozen
          raffle tickets into the waiter's jacket pocket,

<b>          MR, DANNER
</b>          I hope you win the car, sir,
          Mrs. Danner is charmed by her husband's generosity.
          She simply adores the man. David is busy not watching
          Archie and Petulia,

<b>          PETULIA'S VOICE
</b>          Isn't he gorgeous? He's a naval architect.
          It really zings when you say it. "My
          husband David is a naval architect."
          Actually, we're starving. You wouldn't
          want to buy a sixty foot sloop? David's
          "Momma"` and "Poppa' keep us. Look how
          disgusted Poppa is. He hates this sort
          of thing.

</b>          Sensitive, my ass. He's bored. Highway
          safety's so blah. Also, he hates amateurs.
          Give him something he can sink his teeth
          into - "Rheumatoid Arthritis" Â® "Muscular
          Dystrophy"' -m and he's the best there is.
          A real pro. A little lame girl with a
          ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her
          arm, and Poppa can set the world on fire.
          He's really slumming tonight.

<b>          BARNEY'S VOICE
</b>          Hello, Archie.

<b>          MED. PETULIA AND ARCHIE
</b>          have been joined by BARNEY and WILMA, Archie's best
          friends. Barney and Wilma are taking off their coats.
          Barney is already beginning to move to the music.
          0 Wilma is doing absolutely nothing but looking at
          Petulia.

<b>          WILMA
</b>          Everybody came late.

          Barney has begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders,
          becoming part of "The Scene", about which Wilma couldn't
          care less.

          I bumped into last week

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          buying a well larded rib roast.

<b>          WILMA
</b>          Smarty. Have you seen what she's done
          to her hair?

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Wild, huh?

<b>          WILMA
</b>          I said, "Polo, for heaven's sake, you
          look like a teenager."
          Archie doesn't seem too interested and, besides, all
          this is said while Wilma continues to look at Petulia.

<b>          WILMA

          Barney suddenly forgets the music to rescue his Vicuna
          coat which the debutante is smothering under other
          coats as she finally finds Archie's.

</b>          Wilma moves off with Barney. Archie can't spend one
          more second with his coat. He simply puts it on, and
          turns to leave, walking toward the door.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          My name is Petulia,

          Petulia turns to face her husband David, who has taken a few
          steps toward her. She whirls around to face the departing
          Archie.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Archie!
          He turns, almost at the door.

          But in turning to do so she sees David, then the
          spinning car, the door prize.

          Money can't buy me.
          She shakes her head, thoughtfully. During all this the door-
          man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as
          they keep changing their mind.

          A motel sign: "Dream Motel."' A concrete oval, spiral-
          ling up four floors. You drive to your room and everything
          is geared to get you to bed electronically. But you must
          have a car, and Petulia and Archie have come by cab.
          Archie is paying the cabbie.

          what is presumably the entrance -- at least it is the
          bottom of the ramp. They arrive at the booth and
          Archie steps on the. place marked 'Stand Here.' A
          T.V. screen lights up.

<b>          WELL
</b>          There is a small sound and a gadget reaches out which
          normally would fasten to the side of the car. On it is
          an electronic register, an electronic pen and a key with
          a great metal tag (as an example of how this might be
          designed, I recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los
          Angeles). As Archie registers, and puts the ten dollar
          bill where it belongs, Petulia looks at the T.V. set.

          But she is now totally winded and cannot say another
          word. Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena: a tiny
          light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off
          furiously. Just ahead of him is the door of their motel
          room. Archie is aghast at the pulsating key.

          Stark is hardly the word but it will have to do. A
          control panel takes care of the drapes, T.V., stereo,
          announcements from the office, etc., etc., etc. There
          are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia
          does is establish contact between the vanity mirror,
          the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet
          mirror so that she is reflected endlessly.

          Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top
          buttons on the back of her dress.

          Archie plops on the bed in his coat, a most iropic smile
          on his face -- he is beginning to suspect he is not
          going to get laid. Petulia is examining all the Petulia
          faces in the mirrors.

</b>          My great-grandmother is ninety-one and
          still has a granite chin.
          Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to
          vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on
          endless beds.

          husband was killed in the first war, in a

          waxed moustache. She can't remember him but
          she does remember Cary Grant because he is
          from Bristol, too, and often in the news. If
          his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed
          moustache whether he likes it or not.
          She turns to face Archie. She is afraid and she is
          angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one

</b>          Across from the ramp there is the elevator the man on
          T.V. mentioned. Archie is already there waiting for it
          to arrive. Petulia starts toward him angrily.

          love you would be exploring my navel about now.

          An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast with
          the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of
          his car. The elevator doors open. Petulia and Archie
          enter,

          The elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a

          dress remains unbuttoned. He moves behind her and
          begins rebuttoning her. At the touch of his hand,
          something happens to Petulia.

<b>          10 INT. FIRST AID ROOM
</b>
          Archie's hands are holding a little boy under the bright
          lights of a first aid table. The boy is a bloody mess but
          Archie's hands are soothing him even as they so gently
          prod, examining his injuries. Nurses are cutting the boy's
          bloody jeans off him, an expensive watch falls to the
          floor, they retrieve it.

          Petulia's head presses against Archie's hand. She
          kisses it, she rubs her cheek against it.
          The elevator has come to a stop and the doors have opened.
          Archie sees Petulia's tears on his hand.

          Archie crosses to the cab and opens the door. He hustles
          Petulia inside the cab.

          The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him
          through the rear window. Archie allows himself the
          drollest of smiles.

          A jalopy full of dizzy dames with "LOVE" painted in

          Now, we can see the Golden Gate Bridge.

<b>          13 EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAWN

          The house is on the edge of the sea and a cliff rises
          behind it. Petulia is going up the open lift which
          climbs the cliff. It is a very different Petulia.
          She hurts.

          Archie is sleeping. There is the SOUND of a bell

          the phone.

</b>          (into phone)
          I'm up, thanks.
          Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing
          and is constant. He sees the alarm clock, 6:1 He
          stumbles and staggers to the front door.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Yeah... yeah 000 yeah 000
          He opens the door to come face to face with the large
          and twirly front end of a tuba. The tuba is stark
          white for no particular reason.

          ground. A nurse assists Archie. Oliver is a brave, solemn
          little boy, with shadows of fatigue around his eyes. He
          is also a tough little bastard, let me tell you. He is
          now wearing the broken gold watch; though to fit his
          skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot,

          through topless fashion show. A topless ANNOUNCER is

          and arm of the patient's body are sprayed with a special
          liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very
          quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow.
          These various colors indicate physical conditions. They
          are watched, measured, and timed by Archie, Barney and
          their assistants,

          pattern over the patient's drab, withered body. In the
          control area Archie and Barney listen to the strange sounds
          emanating from the computer, each sound again indicating a
          physical condition. The patient's room looks like a comfy
          hotel room: wood paneling, couches, magazines, plants.
          The door leading to outside is three inches thick and
          solid lead. The noise from the equipment is deafening.

          This is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete
          atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on.
          The patient can no longer be seen. He is draped in plastic
          which creates a sub-atmosphere. The doctors and nurses
          are swathed in plastic, again in the atmosphere that lets
          them function best, (This is for real. It exists, for
          instance, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York.) The doctors
          and nurses communicate with each other through throat
          mikes and seem like other world automatons. In all this

          of her neck. It is a clumsy gesture and they clumsily

          Archie is, perhaps, two seconds away from entering Polo,

          been doing. He walks to the far side of the room,
          sticks his shirt in, wipes the sleeve of his shirt
          across his face.
          Polo feels no particular rancor, the entire thing was
          totally unplanned, and she has no more desire to
          "make it" with Archie than he has with her. She pulls
          down her skirt and adjusts her garters.

          he even thought of making love to Polo after all this

          But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping
          her fingers in annoyance. Mr. Howard leaves. The door
          remains open for Petulia to leave. May watches Petulia
          in amused tolerance.

</b>          I should explain about Petuliaa She is
          a kook. We are going to be married.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Archie, when you try to sound cool and
          "with it," you're really pathetic.
          We're trying to have an intelligent
          conversation...

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          About what?

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          Well, about Polo, among other things.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Polo is none of your damned business.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          That's dumb. Dumb. She's my business
          and she's this lady's business. I
          happen to hate Polo.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          (to May)
          Needless to say she's never even met Polo.

</b>          I look at you and I know Polo.

          Explain that to him.
          May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure
          how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be
          the exactly right reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia
          is frightened by May.

          Archie's voice is cold. Petulia is suddenly defeated,

          the patient's chances. He crosses to a sink, bathes his
          face and hands with cold water. He is exhausted. As we
          sometimes glimpse Petulia when no one else is looking
          and see beyond the kookiness, so for an instant we see
          beyond Archie's look of professional assurance and see
          the fearful uncertainty. He now moves into the corridor,
          with each step assuming the doctor's look that is expected
          of him.

<b>          PETULIA'S VOICE
</b>          Hi.
          Archie turns. Petulia is in the medical library with
          books scattered all about her.

</b>          You're kidding.

</b>

          Archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight line
          from Petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop
          him for a moment. Then, without a word, they fall into

          Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring
          him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding
          very touching. It is a facet of Petulia he has never
          seen before.

          There's a jazz joint that stays open

          it will have to do. Heads bump against windows, elbows
          jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be
          stopped. Finally, Archie grips her shoulders and forces
          her to stop.

          Though the streets outside are deserted, the supermarket
          is jammed with people. Archie is pushing a market

          keeps finding things to buy. Archie knows that Petulia

</b>
          Petulia and Archie leave the supermarket with their rolling
          basket of groceries. There is no one else on the street.
          In front of the market is a clown on a pedestal gesticu-
          lating with arms and mouth at people who are not there,
          but making no sound. Petulia quizzically looks up at the
          silent violent clown, while Archie waits for her at the
          car. Finally he taps the horn and she turns and looks at
          him. She starts running toward the car, suddenly wanting
          0 very much to be with him. They kiss lightly.

          wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window, her
          head resting on the sill, lonely.

          Petulia and Archie are both in the bed, asleep and
          somehow as far apart as two human beings can be.

          In the midst of her sleep, Petulia begins jabbering in
          some language all her own. Archie Is eyes open and he
          looks at her and he smiles. Still sound asleep,
          Petulia finishes her statement, whatever the hell it
          was and settles down on the pillow. Archie looks at her.
          She wakes up. They look at each other so gravely that
          they both begin to smile. Neither one is having the
          best night of their life but both are aware of a sense
          â€¢ of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly.
          45 INT. ARCHIEtS BEDROOM MORNING
          Petulia wakes up suddenly. Though she is nude under the
          sheets, Archie is fully dressed for his day with the
          boys. Though his clothes are very sporty he looks
          anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone-

          Okay. Wells why not do some slides anyhow?
          (in sudden anger)

          He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          Well, we knocked off another one. Another
          notch in the old stethoscope.

          It's a hot summer afternoon. Petulia and David have
          driven down from San Francisco. They are members of the
          "San Francisco Matador Club". David has drunk too much
          wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun
          have made him violently ill. Though there are still two
          bulls left to kill, David and Petulia are leaving. As she
          moves down the spindly stairway, Petulia becomes aware of
          Oliver. He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher
          shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market.
          They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be
          sold as "the real thing" .

          out in the back seat and Petulia is having a hell of a
          time trying to move the car out of the parking space.
          Again kids swarm about her like wild animals, trying to
          sell hats, cushions, gum, pottery, etc. Again she sees
          Oliver among them (or is it another kid who looks like

          been Oliver? In Petulia's exhaustion and discomfort, the
          heat, the flies, the blaring horny she can't be sure.
          (NOTE, All through the Tijuana scenes, we HEAR Archie
          and Petulia's telephone conversation. It is utterly banal
          and they know it and are amused by its banality.)
          PETULIA: I was dozing.
          ARCHIE: That's good.
          PETULIA: You left without having breakfast.
          ARCHIE: I had a cup of coffee on the way.
          PETULIA: A cup of coffee. You should have had
          eggs or waffles.
          ARCHIE: I'm fine.
          PETULIA: Me too.

<b>          PAUSE

          ARCHIE: Make some toast, too. And milk.
          Breakfast is a very important meal.
          PETULIA: I wish you'd remember that.
          ARCHIE: Well, goodbye.

          Archie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons
          toward the boat. He is very pleased with his absolutely
          nothing phone conversation.

          Children run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck.
          The boat is passing Alcatraz Island. Archie and the boys
          are standing at the rail,

          Archie is on the ship telephone. He is trying to keep
          a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia,
          it is difficult.

<b>          54 INT. A FISH PLACE ON THE WHARF
</b>
          While Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves, Archie
          is at the wall telephone.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          â€¢ Hello there.

<b>          LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
<b>          55 EXT. THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA
</b>
          During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia
          into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is
          so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate,
          Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod,
          passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over
          the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful
          face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery
          red from the sun.
          Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate,
          dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh,
          dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is
          just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently
          hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown
          out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain.
          But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than
          he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is
          it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the
          driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it
          that "useless" that goads her?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          53
</b>
<b>          55 CONTINUED
</b>          Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no
          importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the
          moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two
          kooks having a few seconds of horsing around.
          The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by
          the honking of thousands of cars and having fully
          inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the
          convertible on through.
          Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the
          border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there.
          Petulia thinks, "okay, you little bastard . " and
          zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first
          moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's
          tough little face.
          During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele-
          phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before.
          ARCHIE: Hi, there.
          PETULIA: Hello.
          ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys.
          PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie,
          ARCHIE: I will, I will.
           PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast.
          ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia.
          PETULIA: Like what?
          ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different
           things on the menu.
          PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french
          fries or baked beans.
          ARCHIE: Okay.
          PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you.
          ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans.
          PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food?
          ARCHIE: Yes.
          PETULIA: Sea bass is nice.
          ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great.
          PETULIA: If they grill it,
          ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass.
          PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet.
          ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked.
          PETULIA: It's such a problem.
          ARCHIE: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia.
          PETULIA: Phone.

          Archie chases them through the floors.
          Archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which
          says that this phone is for the military and is to be
          used only in emergency. Archie approaches it warily,
          then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids.
          Archie wants to get back to Petulia.

<b>          59 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY DAY
</b>
          Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys, is thinking
          â€¢ about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty
          damn good about the whole thing. He opens the door of
          his apartment. He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers

<b>          60 INT. APARTMENT
</b>
          It is empty. Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone.
          All the joy goes out of him. The apartment is a mess.
          The television set is on: a program without sound of
          soldiers fighting. Archie is so disappointed that
          Petulia isn't here. He angrily flips the dial getting
          the same type of program.

<b>          ARCHIE
</b>          A nice, neat kid.
          After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere
          things are scattered about.

<b>          61 INT. BEDROOM
</b>
          The bedroom is the worst of all. The sheets and blanket
          have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall
          mall onto the floor behind. Archie really is annoyed.
          Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets
          and blanket on the floor. A lifeless arm protrudes.
          Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets.
          Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead.

<b>          61 CONTINUED
</b>          Thï¿½-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to
          turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't
          sure she has one,
          Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23.
          Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up
          from the broken rib that this is impossible.
          Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get
          her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant
          then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an
          emergency number.
          Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse
          in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling.
          As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy
          as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't
          open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection
          with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making
          than a life-saving procedure.

<b>          62 INT./EXT. HALLWAY & STEPS OUTSIDE ARCH IE' S APARTMENT
</b>
           Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on

<b>          0
</b>          a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber
          oxygen mask over her mouth.
          We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp-
          ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo,
          facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments;
          boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied.
          Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come
          out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with
          enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples
          Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his
          shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the
          dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should
          seem like a nightmare.
          The dog's owner goes berserk.

<b>          DOG'S OWNER
</b>          Don't you hit Lennie!
          Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond.
          At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all
          spoken together.

          Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other
          a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many
          T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence.
          One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and
          we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the
          Jungle by helicopters.
          Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead
          the way down the steps. Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded
          down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up
          the steps. Everything is chaos.
          The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the
          narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every
          which way - all in the name of saving her life.

          A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and
          the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm.

<b>          63 EXT. A HIGHWAY RESTAURANT NIGHT
</b>
           This is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north from.Mexico.
          The restaurant is a mass of neon, and does very well in,the
          hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a
          break on their way north.
          Among the cars many are filled with bull fight
          afficianados.
          It's about ten p.m. There is a general feeling of
          exhaustion and spent passions. People are bleary-eyed,
          recovering from hangovers, beginning to feel the effects
          of sunburns. All this we see later. First we see Oliver.
          Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who
          0 has just awakened. David is probably just about to say
          "Who the hell are you" when Petulia appears carrying a
          cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice.

          saving most. He gulps it down then uses the straw to

          loaf.of bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen.
          As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct
          sounds from the master bedroom. moans and groans,
          a sudden cry, all of which he supposes are the sounds
          of love-making. He grins to himself in the dark.
          Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the
          hall. She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a
          blouse, and is struggling into a coat. Her hair is

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You've go to have some little memento.
          Right?

<b>          PETUL IA
</b>          David, for God's sakes
          The wrist watch is much too big for Oliver's skinny
          wrist so David starts to fasten it around Oliver's
          biceps. Even this is too skinny so David starts
          fastening it around Oliver's lower leg. Oliver
          has no idea what is happening, but his hustler's
          heart tells him he is being given something very
          valuable. Petulia is repelled.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (to Oliver)
          You see the basic problem is we just don't
          have the room for all the folks my old
          lady invites for a visit. Were kinda
          short of room. I'd give you the shirt off
          my back. I'm West-Texas and proud of it.
          But start loading up the house with
          make-believe kids, plus every Tom, Dick
          and Harry whose one and only claim to
          fame is that he knows how to do "it" --

          Petulia begins sobbing, and trying to tug the boy
          toward the lift.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hands off!
          The watch won't fasten to the leg either. David
          tries to fit it around the boy's neck. David begins
          to cry.

          Petulia somehow gets Oliver into the lift and pushes the
          button. which starts it moving upward.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (calling up)
          I don't want any hard feelings' It

          you up sometime; When we're down that
          way., Have a real old-fashioned fiesta;
          We'll have a ball; "Oliver?"
          During the preceding speech we CUT to Petulia and Oliver,
          Oliver, infuriated at Petulia, defiantly shows her that he
          has David's watch in his fist.

<b>          OL I VER
</b>          He give me!
          Petulia stares out toward the sea. Davis is still screaming
          atl.them, and his voice sounds so unlikely in all the splendor
          of morning coming to San Francisco.

          crosses to the door, puzzled. He knocks on the door but
          there is no answer. He goes around to the back. There's
          an old car without wheels, butane tanks, other junk but no
          sign of life. Archie knocks on the back door and finally
          the door is opened. Beyond the screen door is the Mexican

          Petulia now recreates the moment when she first met Archie.
          Archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket
          to reclaim his coat, Petulia rushes up to him, with
          none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting, but
          with absolute desperation. Archie is dressed as he
           is on the hill (Scene 86).

          In Petulia's mind, a great white ambulance is moving
          majestically through towering trees, carrying Petulia
          to safety.

<b>          PETULIA'S VOICE
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)

          As though you really meant it.

</b>          I didn't know what to do. I was going
          from one moment to the next.

          Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia.

</b>          No, it's not your fault.

<b>          87E THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DAY
</b>          Petulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because
          she has something very serious to say to Archie. She
          is with him on the rocks below the bridge.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          I went back to the house because I owed it
          to David. I have a brown thumb when it

          call them Jesus. And there they hang. I

          She looks up at the bridge and instantly creates David
          standing there. An incredibly heroic figure in a white
          blazer and turtle neck sweater. Yet somehow we must
          sense that despite how grand David looks, at any moment
          in Petulia's mind he may leap to his death.

<b>          PETULIA

          which she does.

          By now, Archie has reached the top of the cliff and is
          a complete mess. He turns for one last look at the
          Danner house and the yacht beyond. He shakes his fist
          maniacally.

          trying to get back to normality. He's having a nice
          sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo's fiance. It
          is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are
          being told about the forest by an Irish guide. In the

          the other way. in the other car is Petulia by herself.
          Petulia waves f.rst. Archie waves back. Petulia has
          shopping parcels.

          The cars start down their separate ways.

<b>          93 INT. PENGUIN PLACE DAY
</b>
          Thirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the
          music of Pomp and Circumstance. Through the Public
          Address System, a voice explains that the penguins
          represent all nations and are gathered 'here for their
          own Olympics which they originated two million years ago,
          when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes.
          Archie senses someone staring at him, turns and sees
          Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels. He
          tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids, but
          he cannot. Actually, he doesn't want to ignore Petulia.
          He looks back, she is still there, smiling happily.
          Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are, then
          starts toward Petulia.
          The penguins are now going through various acrobatics
          while the narrator is telling more about their exotic
          origins. Archie stumbles through laughing children,
          ruins a tourist's snapshot, etc., until he finally reaches
          Petulia.
          Now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby
          carriage. Everyone thinks it's adorable.
          Archie sits beside Petulia not really knowing what to say.
          He hasn't decided whether to be angry that she has followed
          him,- or amused, or delighted -- or all three.

          laughter,, music and applause ?make any intimate conversa-
          tion almost impossible. But Petulia is waiting for
          Archie to say something.
          Archie sees that Mike has turned from the penguins to
          stare at his father accusingly. Mike won't stop staring.
          Mike now tries to make Stevie turn and look accusingly
          with him, Archie doesn't know what to do0
          Finally, Petulia rises and gathers her parcels,, still
          quite pleasant. She drops a parcel and Archie retrieves
          it for hero Its from a sportswear shop,, colorful and
          gay. As Archie gives Petulia the parcel, she touches
          his hand, running her fingers lightly over his skin,
          thoughtful, as though wanting to remember something.
          Petulia moves quickly through people toward the exit.
          Archie almost calls her back, but there is too much noise.

          Archie is returning from work, weighted down with
          books for his research, plus miscroscope.
          He sees his apartment door ajar. His heart stops.
          He kicks his door open with his foot, not daring to
          think who will be inside.

          No, you're wrong. Its not Petulia. Two elderly

          a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which
          would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists
          mostly of music.
          David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries.

          and it hits her lightly on the shoulder. Though it causes

          Petulia and David are returning from the other yacht. They
          are dressed casually, but very well. David is completely
          happy. Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell, she's frightened
          out of her wits. From the other yacht we still hear the
          SOUNDS of the Mariache trio and people squealing with delight
          David is humming along with the music.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          We didn't have to come back this early..

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You're still not one hundred per cent
          well.
          They've reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside.
          Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and
          in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps
          into the cabin.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          So they say,
          Petulia says nothing. She begins undressing,

<b>          DAVID
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          I didn't tell papa to leave.
          She doesn't answer.

<b>          DAVID
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          He only had the clothes on his back.
          She doesn't answer.

<b>          DAVID
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          I didn't.want him to leave.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          All right, David.

<b>          â€¢ DAVID
</b>          "All right, David," through chattering
          teeth.
          Petulia crawls under the sheet of a bunk.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Only a crazy man hits a woman. Or a
          coward. T won't ever again. I'd
          stick my hand into a garbage disposal.
          I would, Petulia. I'd grind it up,
          Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid, David
          abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare
          pistol. He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia.
          She sits up in panic.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hang on to it. If I come for you let
          me have a flare. Between the eyes.
          I'll melt in ten seconds.
          Petulia is touched.

</b>          His finger is pressed against the doorbell over which is
          the nameplate "DR, A. BOLEN." The door finally opens and
          Petulia is standing there in Archie's hooded sweatshirt.
          Her eyes widen in terror as David enters Archie's apartment.
          She knows he has come here to kill her,
          97G The image ends. David is abruptly withdrawn, but Petulia
          is carried away by memory.

<b>          PETULIA
</b>          The first time I saw you, you were being
          charming to- somebody who didn't buy a
          boat after all, You were wearing a light
          blue turtleneck sweater. Your sunglasses
          wÂ®re'pushed up into your hair. You had
          sandals, but'-no socks. Trying. to sell a
          forty foot yacht without socks. I had
          never seen anything so perfect. "He's
          not real. He's one of those plastic

          his hospital jacket which gives him the run of the place.

</b>          They can't keep any secrets around here.

          Petulia twists in pain. The nurse looks over.

          David's tie and continues on his way,

</b>          As Archie exits from the hospital a kid on a roller
          board almost kills him.
          He has an ice cream bar. He sees three pretty girls,
          one with blonde hair like Petulia's. But it's the
          dark-haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back.
          Archie, watching the girl, and eating his ice cream,
          leans against an electrical appliance shop window.
          Inside, among endless other items is a single T.V.
          tube, on which the world's violence flickers silently
          and unnoticed as before.
          As we leave Archie, we feel a sense of euphoria -- well,

          ether mask. The hands seem infinitely gentle. One
          hand touches Petulia's face to reassure her.
