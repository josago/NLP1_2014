          Pitch black. We hear FOOTSTEPS sneaking up an old wooden
          staircase. Two people moving as one.
                         
          Topping the stairs, they creep down the hall to the closed
          door that protects us. We can hear them behind it,
          whispering, bickering insanely, one shushing the other.
                         
          The squeak of a door knob slowly turning. The faint click of
          the latch. And the door inches open, throwing a razor-thin
          shaft of light into the darkness where it illuminates a

          We can hear them bickering again as they shuffle away, their
          footsteps descending the stairs, fading into the uneasy
          silence of this old house...

          Darla puts down the chalk and comes up the aisle to where a
          slight, fair-skinned girl in a thrift shop dress sleeps head
          down on her desk. The girl from the opening scene. LUCY
          SHERIDAN. Darla stands over her with obvious concern. Puts
          a finger to her lips to quiet the giggles.

          trying to locate a single case amid the stacks and clutter on

          her desk. Looks at it guiltily. Takes it down again.
          Handwritten on the front: SHERIDAN, LUCY.
                         
          She opens it. A school portrait of ten-year-old Lucy clipped

          A dark, rundown family home on a once-prosperous cul de sac.

          She reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly, the
          security chain snapping taut. A woman's voice growls at her
          from the darkness inside:

          begrudging courtesy. The house is tidy but sad, steeped in a
          kind of puritanical gloom. Lucy peers down through the
          upstairs banister, anxious, unsure what's going on. Emily

          up the cellar stairs. Emily's and Lucy's faces reflect the

          intimidated, she engages Edward's stare. A battle of wills.

          looks down, shuffling papers. Battle lost.

          madness.
                         
          An ALARM CLOCK with a cracked crystal face. She picks it up
          and it GOES OFF in her hand. Gives her a scare. She puts it
          down. Sees something out the bedroom window. Steps closer.
          Parts the curtains.
                         
          In the backyard, by the garden shed, a long rectangular hole

          steps of a house, together but apart, like a lost child that
          sat down next to a pretty stranger who hasn't yet noticed
          her. Emily's ten-year-old face shows the quiet sadness of
          the disconnect. Reminds you of a child from her caseload.

</b>           ...and I never knew when she was coming
           back, or if she was... I used to think it
           was my fault and I would try so hard when
           she got home to be good, do everything I
           could think of, so she'd think I was
           `special' and stay next time or take me
           with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd
           always go away again, that's how it was.
                         
          Emily fights her emotions and, practiced at the task, wins.
          Lucy sits beside her on the bed. Understands her deeply.

          Emily smiles a pained smile and then buries the memory.

          Lucy exits. Emily eyes the photo a moment longer then stands
          and puts it away in the filing cabinet. She pauses, feeling

          confers with Emily by the water cooler. He's sweating,

          walked out and closed the door behind her.

          He hangs up. Finds the chapter he's looking for. ANTI-
          SOCIAL PERSONALITY TYPE. But he hears it again now -
                         
          BZZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZZZT - louder, deeper - and realizes, in
          quiet terror, that it's coming from INSIDE HIS EAR.

          Doug opens the medicine cabinet and grabs a Q-tip. Wiggles
          it around in his ear and when he takes it out there's a

          sitting on the cottony tip, scissoring its wings.
                         
          Doug stares in disbelief. Mouth gaping.
                         
          He throws the Q-tip in the toilet. Hits the flush lever.
          Watches the hornet spiral away. Gone.
                         
          Stares at the empty bowl. Did I just imagine that?
                         
          Shaken, he turns to the sink. Wedges his head under the tap
          and runs water into his ear.
                         
          Straightens and looks at himself in the mirror, toweling his
          face, trying to impose rational thought on the situation.
          But as the water spills from his ear, down his neck, onto his
          shirt, it brings with it -
                         
          TWO MORE LIVE HORNETS, half drowned.
                         
          With a yelp Doug swipes them from his shirt. Crushes them
          underfoot. Terrified, but clinging to rational thought a
          moment longer, he turns his head sideways to the mirror,
          parts his hair, and sees -
                         
          ANOTHER HORNET crawl from the ear canal, followed by SIX OR

          Rationality goes out the window. He flails at them with the
          towel. Swats them dead. Picks them up and drops them in the
          toilet. Studies the last one for a moment. Its little legs
          twitching. Drops it in. Flushes.
                         
          A false respite. And a brief one. Because as the FLUSHING
          NOISE FADES he can hear an ominous DEEP BUZZING SOUND RISING.
                         
          It's coming from behind him. He turns to have a look.
          Nothing there. Bare wall.
                         
          But it's strange: the BUZZING IS STILL BEHIND HIM.
                         
          With dawning horror Doug turns and checks his back in the
          mirror, sees

          Whimpering like a child, he undoes the buttons of his shirt,
          taking it off as delicately as possible. Slipping his arms
          gently from the sleeves.
                         
          Holding it by the collar, he takes two quick steps and tosses
          it in the shower. Slams the glass door, seals the crack with
          towels. And watches the hornets fly around in the glass
          enclosure, BUZZING FURIOUSLY, bouncing off the glass.
                         
          But as he backpedals he realizes the FURIOUS BUZZING is too
          close, too loud and too deep, to be coming from the shower
          over there. A sharp pain in his head confirms it. He GROANS
          and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens
          inside.
                         
          The BUZZING in his right ear spreads to his left - LOUDER,
          ANGRIER, its sources multiplying. Disoriented, he stumbles
          backwards with an AGONIZING SCREAM. Catches sight of himself
          in the mirror, the terror of the moment on his face. This
          can't be happening.
                         
          And now the nightmare takes a devilish turn. Looking at
          himself in the mirror, he sees -
                         
<b>          HORNETS START CRAWLING FROM HIS NOSE. FROM BETWEEN HIS LIPS.

          Doug grabs his head in both hands and starts shaking it,
          trying to shake away the madness inside. But the hornets
          keep coming, COUGHED UP IN CLUMPS as he gasps for air.
          They're all over him, stinging his tongue, his eyes.
                         
          He goes berserk and starts SMASHING HIS HEAD against the
          wall, the door, the edge of the sink, anything he can find,
          opening a deep gash in his forehead, smashing it harder and
          harder because the BUZZING WON'T STOP, cracking his skull,
          SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY, pitching his head violently forwards
          and backwards like some demon-possessed heavy metal fanatic.
                         
          It's a grotesque display that ends on a sickening note when,
          with one particularly violent head jerk, he snaps his own
          neck - CRACK!!! He sinks to the floor, head askew,
          astonished look on his face.
                         
          And there he sits, paralyzed, eyes locked on the tv in the
          living room where football highlights play in silence. Fully
          conscious as the hornets fight their way back into his ears,
          nose, and mouth - a pilgrimage back to the mind that bore
          them.

          She comes down the steps to his car, walks past it and then
          stops, noticing the window is open a crack. Slipping her
          hand inside, stretching, she extends one finger just far
          enough to push the button on the garage door remote clipped
          to the sunvisor.

           Decency. That's what she feeds on.
           Bleeds ya dry, moves onto the next. We
           were a big family, she went through us
           like a wrecking ball. And you know,

           yourself than think bad things about your
           baby girl. But finally we got to a point
           where me and Maggy looked at each other -
           (remembers so clearly)
           - where we looked at each other and we
           was out of lies, both of us. Most
           terrifying moment of our lives. And

          Emily's stare, she stops and meets it. Waves, testing the
          waters. Emily waves back but it's a hollow gesture. Lucy's

          In a sudden panic Emily goes into the kitchen, grabs one of

          unthinkable - its use as a weapon, self-defense.
                         
          She comes into the living room, holding it. Catches sight of
          herself in the mirror. A jarring image:
                         
          Sweet Emily Jennings with a butcher's knife in her hand.

          spell.
                         
          Emily hides the knife behind the fish tank. No good, you can
          see it through the glass.
                         
          We hear LUCY'S KEY IN THE LOCK.
                         
          Emily grabs the knife. It's in her hand as the door CLICKS
          open, until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa
          pillow.

          Emily watches unnerved as Lucy crosses to the sofa, to the
          very pillow where she hid the butcher's knife, and sits down
          to untie her shoes. The point of the knife is almost
          touching her leg. If she moves at all, it will cut the skin.

          Emily clutches the rail with both hands, SCREAMING as the

          violently, the noise deafening. It's a horrible way to die.
                         
          Emily closes her eyes in anticipation of impact. And in the

          A breathless pause then Emily opens her eyes. And sees the
          elevator is no longer falling. Never was. The doors glide
          open to the first floor lobby.
                         
          Lucy gives her a quiet look and strolls out. A businessman
          steps into the elevator, watching bewildered as Emily
          releases her white-knuckled grip on the railing and staggers
          out, so badly shaken she can barely stand...

          Emily, in a coat and shoes, packing a suitcase. Snaps it
          quietly shut. Looks over at the barricaded door. Draws a

          She steps out, suitcase in hand.
                         
          Tiptoes down the hall. Quietly as possible as she comes past
          Lucy's door. It's open a crack. The room pitch black
          inside. Emily steps closer, breath held. Peers in through

          Comes around to the driver's side door. Jumps in. Closes
          the door. And gets the scare of her life.

          It's too much for Emily. She breaks down. Buries her face
          in her hands and sobs.
                         
          Lucy, after a moment, takes a brush from Emily's bag and
          starts lovingly brushing her hair.
                         
          Emily slowly lifts her head, resigning herself to this latest

          streaming as Lucy tugs gently at the snarls, playing mommy.

          Relentless. Tormenting Emily. Until she can't take it
          anymore. And she SCREAMS as loud as she can, half cursing,
          half begging, the veins standing out in her neck -

          And the POUNDING STOPS DEAD. All we hear is the rain
          drumming on the roof. And Emily's QUICK TERRIFIED BREATHS as
          she stares at the door wondering what's next.
                         
          But there's nothing. Just the shadows dancing on the walls.
          It appears the nightmare is over for now.
                         
          But not quite.
                         
          A sudden CLUNK in the closet makes her jump. Her head snaps
          around - what was that? She just stares, unable to breathe
          because whatever she just heard is INSIDE HER ROOM!
                         
          White-knuckled grip on that screwdriver, Emily stands up and
          comes slowly over to the CLOSET DOOR.
                         
          Raises the screwdriver. Ready to stab.
                         
          Takes hold of the door handle.
                         
          Slowly turns it.

          PITCH BLACK inside.
                         
          A tense pause as she stares into that blackness, then reaches
          a hand into the closet, feeling around for the pull-string.
          Finds it. Gives it a tug. And there, right in front of her,
          is a vision of unspeakable horror:

          A faint CYCLICAL SQUEAKING NOISE in the cubicle right next to
          hers. Goes rigid. Recognizes the sound. Calls over the

          over the partition into the adjacent cubicle.
                         
          It's empty. But the OFFICE CHAIR IS TURNING as if someone
          were just playing there.
                         
          Emily steps slowly back. And now hears the same CYCLICAL

          Suddenly, behind her, at the far end of the office, a
          different NOISE splits the silence. Emily turns and stares
          toward the sound. The XEROX MACHINE. Someone is using it.

          She stares at the idle machine for a moment, then at the
          STACK OF COPIES lying upsidedown in the tray. She comes
          over, picks them up. Turns them over.

          Successive pages show the same two hands, but leaning forward
          into the inky blackness between them is a FACE, its features
          resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass. The
          last page is a horrific image. A man screaming in such
          terror that his face appears almost deformed.
                         
          It's DOUG. The night of his death. Like a snapshot from his
          bathroom mirror.
                         
          Emily shudders, the stack of pages tumbling to the floor.
          Runs out. And we see the photocopies, lying on the floor,

          Middle of the night, the living room is lit by the eerie glow
          of the fish tank. The filter humming. The fish swimming
          languidly. Suddenly they DISPERSE, spooked by something
          outside the tank.

          The bureau has been pushed in front of the deadbolted door to
          form a barricade. Emily lies in a fetal position on her bed,
          exhausted but unable to sleep.
                         
          She tenses at the sound of a MUFFLED MALE VOICE in the other
          room. Comes over to the door, trying to listen. Thinks she
          recognizes it.

          Emily turns off the tv. IMMEDIATELY IT SWITCHES ITSELF BACK
          ON. Emily freezes, realizing the room is not empty.
          Turning, she sees Lucy sitting in the shadows holding the
          remote. Lucy mutes the sound and returns Emily's stare,
          thoughtful, almost empathetic.

          Emily nods. The room bathed in the tv's flickering blue

          menacing voice, explains the rules:

          Emily gives a haunted nod, remembering:
                         
          A FLASHCUT of Lucy sitting between Edward and Margaret at the
          Child Services meeting, new dress, ribbon in her hair,

          She holds Emily's gaze then looks back at the tv. Margaret's
          image reflected in the pupils of her eerie unblinking eyes.

          The Nurse exits. Locks the door.

          She stands up, looking around, trembling at what's to come.
          Her footsteps sound oddly HOLLOW, METALLIC on the floor.

          We can hear the low HISS of it filling with gas. The faint
          POOF as it ignites beneath her. The first SHIMMERING WAVES
          OF HEAT rising up, singeing her hair.
                         
          Margaret runs screaming to the door, claws at the pane of
          glass like a madwoman. But there is no escape from the hell
          of her own mind. The YOUNG NURSE'S FACE APPEARS there in the
          window, shocked by Margaret's insane rantings.

          He sits down at a table and starts eating, quiet, lost in his

          chewing, noticing something very strange:

          Edward goes berserk. Launches himself across the table at
          the guy, stabbing him in the neck with his fork. Vicious
          attack. Unprovoked as far as anyone else is concerned. A
          guard rushes over. Edward turns on him, maniacal.

          witnessed the event starts to applaud. Others join in. It's

          Barron, saying goodbye to his WIFE and SON, sets down the
          overnight bags they've packed.

          Kisses her. Turns to his son.

<b>          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>                         
          Barron strides down the corridor, his face reflecting the
          grim task ahead.
                         
<b>          INT. HOTEL PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT
</b>                         
          His footsteps echo in the parking structure as he walks along
          a row of parked cars.
                         
          A faint JANGLING SOUND stops him dead in his tracks. He
          turns and scans the garage behind him. It's quiet, eerily
          still.
                         
          He continues onward, but hears the faint JANGLING SOUND again
          a moment later. Spins, trying to place it. There it is
          again. Closer this time. Something moving, hiding, behind
          the rows of cars over there.

</b>                         
                         
          He bends, trying to get a look under the cars. Can't see
          anything. Unnerved, he moves on, clicks the button on his
          keychain remote. The lights flash on his car fifty yards
          away.
                         
          But as he continues toward it they reveal themselves,
          trodding into view from between the cars, CHOKE-CHAIN COLLARS
          JANGLING around their necks...
                         
<b>          THREE PIT BULLS
</b>                         
          Battle-scarred. Vicious. The dogs from Diego's house. They
          sit down right in front of Barron's car. It's a surreal
          moment, a trio of attack dogs sitting at quiet attention,
          square-jawwed, black-eyed, the kinetic calm before a predator
          strikes.
                         
          Barron draws his gun. Fires a warning shot over their heads.
                         
<b>          BANG!
</b>                         
          Deafeningly loud, it echoes through the garage like a
          thunderclap. But the dogs don't move, just sit there
          staring.
                         
          Barron lowers his gun. It's time to get the hell out of
          here. He backpedals, making no sudden movements, gun still
          trained on the dogs.
                         
          They watch him, eyes livening with excitement, one of their
          back legs twitching in anticipation.
                         
          Barron quickens his step and that's their cue.
                         
<b>          ALL AT ONCE, WITH EXPLOSIVE SPEED, THE DOGS SPRING INTO

          Barron fires an errant shot and takes off running. But he
          can't match their pace, the deadly trio race along the row of
          police cruisers, closing the gap with ease.
                         
          At the last second Barron jumps the partition. The pit bulls
          crash skull-first into the concrete, but continue their
          pursuit unfazed as Barron takes off up the adjoining ramp.
                         
          He jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods,
          denting the metal. The dogs jump up behind him, relentless
          in their pursuit.
                         
          Jaws snapping at his heels, Barron takes to the car roofs,
          the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him.
<b>           94.
</b>                         
                         
          He looks back just in time to see the dogs launch themselves.
          They hit him at chest height, sinking teeth in his flesh.
                         
          Stumbling forward, struggling to keep their jaws from his
          throat, Barron doesn't see what's coming. The last car. The
          edge of the parking garage.
                         
          He's over the edge before he even understands, flailing his
          arms for a handhold that doesn't exist. The ground, far
          below, flies up at him in a rush of acceleration.
                         
          We hear a sickening THUD and find Barron lying face down on
          the pavement below, blood pooling around him. Clinging to
          life, he opens his eyes and sees the TRIO OF PIT BULLS
          SITTING OBEDIENTLY BESIDE HIM, unharmed, watching.
                         
          But from a distance we see there is only Barron. Dying alone
          between the parked cars. No dogs anywhere in sight.

          Emily opens the front door, peers in, trying not to make a
          sound.

          EMPTY BANKER BOXES strewn in the hall. SCATTERED PAGES.
                         
          At the far end, the light is on in Lucy's bedroom. The door
          open a crack. A shaft of light spilling out into the
          darkened hallway.
                         
          Emily comes down the hallway past SCATTERED FILE PAGES.
          Preliminary reports. Medical records. Personality
          profiles...

          Black eyes. Bloody noses. Bruises. Cuts. Burns. PHOTOS
          OF ABUSED CHILDREN COVER THE ENTIRE FLOOR. A collage of
          misery.
                         
          Lucy is nowhere to be seen. Emily comes in and starts
          quickly picking them up.
                         
          Tucked between the file cabinet and the wall is a CORKBOARD.
          Emily pulls it out. It's covered with PHOTOS FROM WORK.
          COWORKERS. HER KIDS. Two of the photos are turned around.
          She flips them over in rapid succession. Diego. Doug.
                         
          She rips all the photos from the board.
                         
          Photos bunched in her hands, she heads for the door, but
          hears something that stops her in her tracks -
                         
          A strange INTERMITTENT BUZZING NOISE
                         
          It lasts two seconds and stops. She turns around, scans the
          room. Puts down the stack of photos. There it is again:
                         
<b>          BZZZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZZZT.
</b>                         
          Sounds like a housefly trapped against a window, but it's
          bigger, angrier, and appears to be coming from the

          at the foot of Lucy's bed. Emily crosses to it. The BUZZING
          STOPS. She bends. Takes hold of a corner. Peels it slowly
          back to reveal

          As she approaches it the BUZZING INTENSIFIES, louder, more
          agitated.
                         
          Pauses as she gets there, terrified of what she might find,
          the bed BUZZING FURIOUSLY FROM WITHIN. Something is trapped
          under those blankets, waiting for release.
                         
          Emily extends a trembling hand, takes hold of the blankets
          and, slowly, rigid with fear, peels them back to reveal

          With a tense swallow Emily realizes it's coming from lower,
          deeper within the bed, between the mattress and the box
          spring.
                         
          She slips her fingers into the crack.
                         
          And slowly lifts the mattress, the BUZZING GROWING
          FRIGHTENINGLY LOUD as its source is exposed, something
          hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to
          see what lies below -

          Presses the TALK button. Brings it to her ear.
                         
          The LOW STATIC of an open line. Then, a RASPY MALE VOICE:

          Someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there.

          to the floor. Lucy sits up, lip split. Tastes the blood
          with her tongue. Hint of a smile. The taste of victory.

          Takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave. Empties it into a
          bowl. Sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv
          remote, watching it like nothing ever happened. Emily walks
          over and pitches the tv onto the floor. The SCREEN SHATTERS.

          shudders at the sight.
                         
          Lucy's features look altered somehow, sharpened. It's

          front of the bureau just to be sure.
                         
          In the silence we hear LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall
          toward the door.
                         
          Closer, closer...
                         
          There's nothing else to block the door with. Emily backs
          away, trembling as
                         
          LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS arrive at the door. A tense silence. Then:

</b>           Emily... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to...
                         
          Emily grabs the screwdriver, clutches it in both hands.
                         
<b>           LUCY (O.S.)

          There's a GENTLE KNOCK on the door. Emily flinches,
          remembering last time.

          it shook the door, this time it shakes the entire wall.
          Emily recoils, dropping the screwdriver.
                         
          WHAM! CRACKS APPEAR in the door as it bows from the
          tremendous force.
                         
          WHAM!! CRACKS FAN OUT into the plaster around the doorframe.
                         
          WHAM!! Half the SCREWS HOLDING THE HINGES fly from the wall.

          WHAM!! The DEADBOLT SCREWS getting yanked from the wood.
                         
          Emily frozen in terror, watching. Whatever's out there is
          coming in.
                         
          WHAM!! One of the DOOR HINGES rips clean from the wall.
                         
          WHAM!! The FIRST DEADBOLT comes flying off.

          WHAM!! The DOOR SPLITS down the center.
                         
          WHAM!! The THIRD DEADBOLT lands on the floor at Emily's feet
          with a METAL THUD.
                         
          A breathless silence.
                         
          Then the DOOR RATTLES and drops loose from the frame with a
<b>          DEAD WOODEN CLUNK.
</b>                         
          Nothing holding it in place now except the bureau and the
          bed. And now they both start to SLIDE BACKWARDS as whatever
          is on the other side starts pushing its way in.

          Emily topples a high bookcase against the door and pushes
          back with every ounce of strength she can muster, but it's no
          use. The bureau overturns, CRASHES to the floor. Emily's
          bare feet slide backwards along with the bed.
                         
          And then they stop. The barricade sufficiently breached.
                         
          Emily, in her panic, makes a hasty decision. She hides under
          the bed.
                         
          We HOLD LOW on the open door as LUCY'S FEET step into the
          room, the feet of a child, but the BREATHING we hear sounds
          emphysemic and the VOICE is unquestionably male - harsh,
          guttural, taunting Emily as it comes for her:
                         
<b>           SINISTER MALE VOICE
</b>           Emily...
                         
          Wide-eyed with terror under the bed, she watches those feet
          pick their way over the shattered remnants of the barricade.
                         
<b>           SINISTER MALE VOICE
</b>           Emily... We need to learn healthier ways
           of resolving conflict, Emily.
                         
          The feet step gingerly past the overturned bureau.
                         
<b>           SINISTER MALE VOICE
</b>           ...Most families don't even know they
           have a problem...
                         
          The feet stop at the SCREWDRIVER.
                         
<b>           SINISTER MALE VOICE

          A HAND reaches down and picks it up, a girl's hand, but the
          fingers as they wrap tightly around the handle look strong
          and sinewy.
                         
          The feet stand motionless for a moment then turn and come
          toward the bed, stopping right in front of EMILY'S HORRIFIED

</b>                         
          A pause and then, still from Emily's POV, we see Lucy lower
          herself onto her knees.
                         
          WHAM!! - with shocking force that hand IMPALES THE
<b>          SCREWDRIVER IN THE WOODEN FLOOR!
</b>                         
          Another pause then both hands come into view, palms flat on
          the hardwood, as she leans her head down.

          Emily recoiling in anticipation as the face comes into view -

          Emily, hyperventilating, stares in shock. Lucy reaches her
          hand in. Emily backs away, wedges herself in the corner.

          Lucy slithers out and we see her feet scamper from the room.
          Emily puts her head down on the floor and cries, covering her

          Emily, still in tears, takes it from the burner. Dumps SIX

          The hallway, the bathroom, the kitchen, all of it.

          Emily sits and watches as the door to Lucy's bedroom is
          engulfed. It's an image straight from hell: A YOUNG WOMAN

<b>          EXT. PRIVATE WOODED ROAD - DAY
</b>                         
          Lucy walks a private road through sunlit forest with a kind
          RETIRED COUPLE. Temporary guardians who've taken her in for
          the weekend.
                         
<b>                          LUCY
</b>           Why can't I live with you?
                         
<b>                          RETIRED WOMAN
</b>           Oh, darling, we're not foster parents, we
           just help out when the system's full.
<b>           111.

<b>                          RETIRED MAN
</b>           They'll contact us, Lucy, when your
           placement comes through.
                         
          The woman puts her arm around her as they walk on.
                         
<b>                          RETIRED WOMAN
</b>           Some nice family that always wanted a
           little girl.
                         
          Lucy smiles, shy, innocent, quietly taking in the scenery.
                         
<b>          INT. FOSTER PLACEMENT SERVICES - NIGHT
</b>                         
          Two women cross the office after hours, a pudgy middle-aged
          FOSTER CARE SUPERVISOR and a younger CASEWORKER who is
          leaving for the day. The office reminds you of Child
          Services, another tier of the child welfare system.
                         
<b>                          CASEWORKER

<b>                          SUPERVISOR
</b>           I don't know.
                         
<b>                          CASEWORKER
</b>           Oh, you should. It'll be fun.
                         
<b>                          SUPERVISOR
</b>           Maybe I will, I don't know. We'll see.
                         
<b>                          CASEWORKER

<b>                          SUPERVISOR
</b>           See you tomorrow.
                         
          The Caseworker exits. The Supervisor comes down the row of
          cubicles dropping files on desks. Alone. After hours. A
          thankless profession.
                         
          It lands on some random desk, amid the usual backlog of mail
          and paperwork. A case file like all the others. The name
          typed on the label:
