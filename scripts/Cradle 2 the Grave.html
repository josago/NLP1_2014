</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY
</b>
End of the day.     An armored truck moves through the city of
Los Angeles.

<b>EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
</b>The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges
from the back with a satchel and heads inside.


<b>INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS
can be heard from a second floor balcony.
DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing
the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and
dials. Beat. Into phone --
<b>                         DOUGLAS
</b>           Last delivery's finally here.
The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As
he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard
references the sounds from upstairs --
<b>                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
</b>           Party?
<b>                         DOUGLAS
</b>           Introducing a new line of jewelry.
<b>                         ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
</b>           Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.
           Told her to spend a little time with
           the family jewels first.
PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside.
Handing over the satchel and heading out --
<b>                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
</b>           Keep it real.

<b>INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to
gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator
doors slide closed...
<b>
</b><b>                                                              3.
</b>
<b>INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of
the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to
a walk-in vault.

The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges
with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of
the vault.
A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading
the cart into the vault.

<b>INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
</b>
A train arrives.   People jostle on and off.
One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.
Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap
over his shoulder.
The train doors begin to close.   When...
A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and
a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.
Intense.
Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They
check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the
platform into the tunnel and disappear.

<b>INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
</b>The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He
closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the
door, securing the vault.

<b>INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
</b>Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to
the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-
voltage third rail.
Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.
Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him
back up and away from the danger.
<b>                        FAIT
</b>          Watch yourself.
Miles nods.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              4.
</b><b>                           FAIT
</b>          Keep it tight.
Miles nods again, and they set off.


<b>INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
</b>Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security
station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and
scans the security monitors.

<b>ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS
</b>depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various
empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man
in the suit riding up.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>Douglas settles back in with his magazine.

<b>INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
</b>Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.    Fait
starts to open it.
Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an
APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.   Press
their backs against it as tightly as they can.
The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's
gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.

<b>INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY
</b>Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts
and rights, following more spray paint.
They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the
sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a
flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-
painted circle.
<b>                           FAIT
</b>          Bull's-eye.
Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.    Fait
pulls out a cell phone.

<b>EXT. PARKING GARAGE - (SANTA MONICA) ROOFTOP - DAY
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                                    5.
</b>
A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird.

<b>INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through
HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,
just STATIC.
Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even
more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the
phone.
<b>                           CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
</b>           Yes?

<b>                         FAIT (V.O.)
</b>           We're in position.
<b>                         CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
</b>           Delivery confirmed. The stones are
           there.
<b>                           FAIT (V.O.)
</b>           Not for long.
<b>CLICK.   HISS.
</b>Su didn't like what he just heard.       Curses in Chinese.   And
takes off.

<b>EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</b>Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to
the park. The top floor is at street level.
Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He
moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's
an eight-story drop.
Su faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof.
Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs
onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then
lets go.
Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a
sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto
the balcony.


<b>INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                                    6.
</b>A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby,
CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When...
<b>                         SU (0.S.)
</b>           Where are the stones?

Christophe turns.       Sees Su standing behind him.
<b>                         CHRISTOPHE
</b>                   (French accent)
           Who the fuck are you?
Wham.   The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap.
<b>                         SU
</b>           Who's getting them for you?

<b>                            CHRISTOPHE
</b>           Fuck off.
Wham!   Wham!   Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch-
slap.
<b>                            CHRISTOPHE
</b>           I'll tell you.
<b>                            SU
</b>           I know.

<b>INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
</b>A plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab
overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.
Fait hammers at the last layer. And...

<b>INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>A hole appears under the private display table, where it
can't be seen by the room's security camera.

<b>INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
</b>Fait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving
earwig.
<b>                            FAIT
</b>           Daria.

<b>INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
</b>Douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security
monitors again. Everything a-okay.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                   7.
</b>

<b>ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
</b>A limo pulls up outside.


<b>EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
</b>A uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the
back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a
short, tight dress emerges.

<b>INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
</b>
Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She
approaches the security station. Up close, in the light,
Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.
<b>                        DARIA
</b>          I'm here for the reception.
<b>                          DOUGLAS
</b>          Name, please?
<b>                          DARIA
</b>          Angie Rawlins.
Douglas scans a list of names.      Checks off hers.
<b>                        DOUGLAS
</b>          Thank you. You can go on up.       Front
          elevator, to the mezzanine.
Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just
glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.
<b>                        DARIA
</b>          ... I hate these things.      Don't you
          hate these things?
<b>                        DOUGLAS
</b>          I'm just here to do my job.
Daria looks back at Douglas.      Studies him a moment.   Liking
what she sees.
<b>                        DARIA
</b>          Then again, you never know who you're
          going to meet...
She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.      Then leans over the
desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.
<b>                          DARIA
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                               8.
</b>          I'll bet you're a lot more fun than
          any of those boring people upstairs.
Douglas is unaffected.   Just looks at her blankly.
<b>                         DOUGLAS
</b>          Really, ma'am.   I have a job to do.
Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.
Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.

<b>DARIA'S POV
</b>The magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big
pecs, big penises.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>Daria steps back.
<b>                        DARIA
</b>          Well, I suppose I should go up and
          see what they're selling.
Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.
<b>                         DARIA
</b>          Tommy...
What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as
Daria walks toward Tommy:
She whispers into a hidden mike --
<b>                        DARIA
</b>          Change of plans. He's gay.
Tommy hears it over his earwig.
<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          No way.
<b>                         DARIA
</b>          Yeah way.
<b>INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
</b>Fait and Miles have heard it, too.   Into his mike --
<b>                          FAIT
</b>          Tommy.    Your turn.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            9.
</b>
A look of alarm on Tommy's face.    Into his mike --
<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          Uh-uh.

<b>                        FAIT
</b>          This isn't a conversation.    Do it.
It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit.
<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          Shit.
<b>                         DARIA
</b>          Key-card.

Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --
<b>                        DARIA
</b>          Why don't you keep my purse?     I
          shouldn't be too long.
Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.
Then heads toward the elevator, as...
Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to
look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans
over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.
<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          ... Aloha.
(NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20
 thru 28.)
Douglas looks up from his magazine.
<b>                         DOUGLAS
</b>          Hi.
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          I hope you don't take offense at
          this... but I just have such a
          weakness for a man in uniform.
<b>                        DOUGLAS
</b>          If that's your thing...
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Uniform's definitely my thing. I
          mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking,
          mmm, seafood. Y'know?
<b>                        DOUGLAS
</b>          I'm not actually supposed to be
<b>
</b><b>                                                   10.
</b>          talking on duty.
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Who's talking? Honey, this is a
          flirting... But you're probably just
          another good-looking man wasting it
          all on women. World's full of fools.
Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-
          A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the
          pictures of those underfed, white
          males and let's broaden your
          horizons.

<b>                        TOMMY (CONT'D)
</b>          I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and
          I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm
          not too cute for you. And don't tell
          me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll
          come over there and slap a little
          discrimination right upside your
          yummy little cheeks.
<b>                        DOUGLAS
</b>          I'm hooked up.
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Another big, hot, cuddly, black love-
          Jesus got there first. That bitch.
          Taking you. From me.
<b>                        DOUGLAS
</b>          Sorry.
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I
          can appreciate the monogamy. Saving
          it for your number one is keeping the
          world safe, and it's okay by me.
          Even if you are just breaking my
          heart... Guess I'll just have to come
          in here someday, let you catch me
          shoplifting and resist arrest -- just
          to have you wrestle me down and cuff
          me.
<b>                        DOUGLAS
</b>          I can be pretty rough.
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Don't you get me all excited now.   I
          was just learning to accept my
          disappointment.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                11.
</b>
Tommy sticks out his hand.
<b>                           TOMMY
</b>          Tommy.     But you can call me Rachel.

Shaking hands --
<b>                        DOUGLAS
</b>          Douglas. And, man, I really gotta
          get back to what I'm supposed to be
          doing, okay?
He looks away.     Scans the monitors.


<b>ANGLE - MONITORS
</b>Everything looks normal.

<b>ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLAS
</b>Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault,
Tommy relaxes.
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          I'll leave you alone. But is it okay
          if I just stand here and stare at the
          muscles I'll be missing for the rest
          of my
          life?
OFF which...

<b>INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Daria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's
attention. He does.
Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the
controls to go down.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...

<b>TOMMY
</b>who furtively flips her the bird.        Never missing a beat with
Douglas.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            12.
</b><b>INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
</b>Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.

<b>INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
</b>
On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria
descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's
attention diverted.

<b>INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
</b>Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's
security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan,
Fait films the room. When he's done....

<b>CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERA
</b>We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait
pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon
the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.

<b>INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
</b>As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera,
Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to
work.

<b>INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
</b>On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera
slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy
continues diverting Douglas's attention.

<b>INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
</b>Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves
equipment bags through the hole in the floor.
Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three
steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a
high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault
door.
Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the
steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door.
Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside.
A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             13.
</b>Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had
slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal
canister of liquid nitrogen.
Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound
as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault
door. The outside frosts over.
Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips
on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.
<b>                        FAIT
</b>          Out.

<b>INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY
</b>
Speeding through L.A.   Calling 911 on a cell phone.
<b>                        SU
</b>          ... I want to report a crime in
          progress.

<b>INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
</b>Fait is the last one down through the hole.   Beat.    He looks
at the others.
<b>                        FAIT
</b>          Faith.
<b>                        MILES
</b>          Faith.
<b>                        DARIA
</b>          Faith.
Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.   He pushes
the button. And...

<b>INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
</b>The SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the
room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the
vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck
out of the door.

<b>INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
</b>They felt a rumble.   Tommy covers --
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Earthquake.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             14.

</b>The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door
in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM
augured into the opposite wall.
<b>                          DARIA

Miles moves down the rows of   drawers, using a tool to pop
all the locks. Fait and Daria   follow behind, quickly pulling
out the drawers and emptying   jewels into nylon bags. Fait
empties drawer after drawer.    All white diamonds. When...
He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds.     And
stops, admiring them.

Fait moves to her. Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she
found in a drawer. Pulls out a handful of... Large black
diamonds. Many more in the bag.

He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When...

head around the corner of the train.

</b>SWAT cops hustle passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY
helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND

Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at
her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his
eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down.
She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her

looks back at him in disbelief.

the rear steps. When...
Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him
flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in
front of him.

Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su
and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The
deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous.
Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But
he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the
bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then
goes.


<b>INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
</b>Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above
Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches
from their heads.
Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward
the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The
car takes a wide curve.
Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip.
Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches
for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off
the train.
Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts
sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts
out both hands as far as he can. And...
Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists
with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof
of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait
lets her go, they both die.

<b>INT. RENTAL T-BIRD (OUTSIDE SUBWAY ENTRANCE) - DAY
</b>Su gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A
fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it,
increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws
the bag down, cursing in Chinese.

<b>INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
</b>Fait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the
train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop.
Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.

</b>Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of
jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag
of black diamonds. Still has them.
Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand,
they melt into the crowd of commuters.

As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV go to
retrieve baggage...
A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling.   She's
also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful.     SONA.
She's not smiling. As Ling approaches her --

Ling's mood quickly darkens.

She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over.
Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over.

there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain.

The cannon stops. Having locked on...Fait, standing in
front of the tank. From inside the tank, a muffled voice.
<b>                        VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Bang.
A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man,
pops his head up out of the tank.
<b>                        ARCHIE
</b>          Like it?
<b>                        FAIT

As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait --

Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN
UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie.

<b>                        ARCHIE

Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait.

          Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No.
Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black
diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup.
Studies them a moment. Shrugs.

<b>INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

<b>INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the closed
door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly
out into the room. Looking for Christophe.
Fait continues moving around through the room. When he
steps in something wet. He bends down and checks it out.
Water. The carpet's soaked.
His eyes go to something. Fait finds a cord and turns on a
switch. The light in the fish tank snaps on.
REVEAL Christophe.     Stuffed inside the tank.     Sleeping with
the fishes.

Fait launches   himself at Su. Gonna fight     his way    out the

A long beat. The two men facing off. Then...
As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out...

<b>EXT. STREET NEAR CHRISTOPHE'S - NIGHT
</b>Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off.

<b>INT./EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
</b>Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac
Escalade pull away from the curb and follow.
Fait doesn't need it.
<b>                           FAIT
</b>             Oh, man...
He's about    to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner
and falls    in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps
driving.     Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...
Fait hits    it. Until...
Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,
but is cut off by the on-coming cars.
We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an
intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight.

</b><b>                                                               30.
</b><b>INT./EXT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the
intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a
wall.

<b>EXT. ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize
them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize
that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn
and fight.

Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.
The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-
muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open
door of the Escalade, guns to his head.
<b>                        LING THUG #1

He cocks his pistol.   Beat.

          'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I

Whereupon a...

fence.

</b>two. Using all means available. During the battle, a killer
tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost
gets it. When...
Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind
the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and
smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely
escaping with his arm.
The fight continues.   Fait and Su wear them down.
Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone
crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a
piece.
Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see
a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until
it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down.
The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and
Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
evading the ferocious attack dogs.
Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off
Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a
flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open.
<b>                        SU
</b>          Over here.
Fait follows, right on his heels.
The dogs close in.
Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door.
Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and
rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap
in after Fait.
Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the
other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams
the door shut.
We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed
door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that
door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside.
The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As
Fait digs out the phone, to Su --

Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.   Turns
it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as...
Charles slams the door shut.   Locks it.   And...
Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her
anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on
the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark
camper.
Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it.
A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the
fear go away, but giving her strength.

</b>A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as
dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until
they reach the last cell.
The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries.    Hanging
blankets cloak the cell entirely from view.
Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One
sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets
covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING...


<b>INT./EXT. CHAMBER'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The
last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as
Joel's office.
JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime
lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the
terms of his incarceration.
Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS,
sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs
benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries;
French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler
and the daily mail.
The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go.

<b>INT. HANGAR - DAY
</b>RUSSELL, the science and technology end of Ling's operation,
carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five-ton
truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption, which
he's in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar.
He puts down what he's carrying next to the contraption and
starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is
looking in the back of the truck.
<b>                          RUSSELL
</b>          Hey!    Get away from there!
Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic.

</b>          What are you doing?!
<b>                        CHARLES
</b>          Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if
          I could help with something.
<b>                        RUSSELL
</b>          You can't! It's very delicate
          equipment! Stay away! Just stay
          away from my truck!
<b>                         CHARLES
</b>          What?
<b>                        RUSSELL

</b>          Stay away from my truck!

Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby.
<b>                         SONA
</b>          Stop it.
Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun
screaming inside the camper.
<b>                        VANESSA (O.S.)
</b>          I want my daddy!
Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell --

<b>                        CHARLES

          away...
<b>                        VANESSA (O.S.)
</b>          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Charles joins Sona.   Re:   Russell --
<b>                        CHARLES
</b>          Someone give the geek his Ritalin.
<b>                        SONA
</b>          At least he's doing his job. Which
          is more than I can say for some
          people.
<b>                        VANESSA (O.S.)
</b>          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape.
<b>                        SONA
</b>          Tape her up and gag her.
As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van,
unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it.
Then opens the door. And...
Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his
waist.
<b>                         VANESSA
</b>          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!    I
          want my daddy!
<b>                        CHARLES
</b>          Get the hell off me.
He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on
her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face
away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists.
<b>                        CHARLES
</b>          ... Waste of time... I can think of a
          better way of shutting you
          up --
Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads.   Charles howls in
pain and lets her go.
Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper.

Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut. And now... We
suddenly realize she has the key and remote! The crying
just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles. Vanessa pushes
the remote. And...

</b>THUNK go the DOOR LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is

                  (yells to Sona)
          She got the key!

<b>INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Vanessa climbs into the driver's seat. Puts the key into
the ignition and STARTS the ENGINE. Puts it in "D."

<b>CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL
</b>To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An
extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the
can...

</b>takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't
see where she's going. But she's going.

scrambles after.

the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men.
Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:   at the

ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through
the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door.

Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos.
A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room.
Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the

Like at    a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of

lands,    the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to
shield    themselves from flying blood.

<b>                        DOORMAN
</b>          City's really gonna come and close us
          up?
<b>                        TOMMY

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why
          would I be fucking with you?
The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then --
<b>
</b><b>                                                              56.
</b>
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Look. Let's do this. You let me
          start with a couple small rooms,
          y'know, offices or something,
          someplace you don't have customers.
          Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother
          anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug
          bombs, and then we'll do the rest
          later. How's that?
The Doorman considers a moment.     Then --
<b>                        DOORMAN
</b>          ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and
          come on.


<b>INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
</b>Daria keeps dancing. Peeling off layers now.    Showing skin.
Odion's starting to salivate.

<b>INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a
normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A
large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of
the room.
The door opens.   The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around
in amazement.

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>          ... Look.   At.   This.
<b>                        DOORMAN

          bro.
<b>                          TOMMY
</b>          Roger that.
He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off
one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes --
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          Just keep the door closed and be sure
          to give this shit a full hour before
          anyone comes in.
OFF the closing door...
<b>
</b><b>                                                              57.
</b><b>EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>Fait and Miles grab gear bags and mobilize. Clip onto
ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a second-story
window. A window into...


<b>INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away.
Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it.
BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs
and toss them out.
As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out
a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room
quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS
from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something
bigger.
BLEEE.   He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk.
<b>                             FAIT
</b>             Safe.
He kneels.     Removes a desk panel.   And...
There it is.     The safe is small but highly secure.
<b>                             FAIT
</b>             Take it down.
Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A
big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50
cal."

<b>INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
</b>Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and
sexy for Odion.

<b>INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>Miles loads one of the massive D.U. cartridges into the
Barrett.
<b>                           MILES
</b>             Even with the music, they're gonna
             hear it when I fire this tank buster.
<b>                             FAIT

Miles aims the BARRETT directly at the safe lock.      Miles
<b>FIRES. BIG BANG.
</b>

<b>INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
</b>Odion starts.
<b>                          ODION
</b>          What was that?

<b>INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Basically, the lock's just gone. Melted. Burned through by
the DU slug. Fait swings the safe door open.

<b>INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>Odion's heading out the door. When he stops.       Looks back at
Daria. A realization dawning.
<b>                        ODION
</b>          'Sometimes you need an old friend'...
He steps toward Daria.    Backhands her.   Hard.   Then opens
the door.
A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion.
<b>                        CHAMBERS MAN
</b>          It came from the office.
<b>                         ODION
</b>          Watch her.   Don't let her leave.
Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at
Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off.

<b>INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>Fait's tossed the safe.     No stones.
<b>                          MILES

<b>                           FAIT
</b>           Everyone out.
Fait's started searching the room.       Tearing it apart.
<b>                         MILES
</b>           What about you?
<b>                         FAIT

<b>                         MILES

<b>                           FAIT
</b>           Yes, you are.    Go.   Now.
Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.      Fait doesn't stop.
<b>                        MILES
</b>           T. Come on, man. They're outside.
           Give it up.

</b>           Shut up and get the fuck outta here!
           That's an order!
Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are
trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window.
Onto the ascender-descender. And gone.

<b>INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>Daria finishes dressing.     When...
<b>                         CHAMBERS MAN
</b>           ... Y'know, I got the big one...
Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a
spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him --
<b>                         DARIA
</b>           Keep it in your pants.

<b>INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>CRASH!   Odion and his men break down the door.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               60.
</b>
Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones.
Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first
men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And
then...

The guns are out.     All pointed at Fait. No stones. No exit.

<b>INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
</b>Daria walks out the front door.

<b>INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY
</b>
Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he
eats another meal. Lobster. At first, we don't realize who
Chambers is addressing.
<b>                        CHAMBERS
</b>          ... If you're willing to pay five,
          you're willing to pay ten.
<b>                           CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
</b>          You're    willing to pay ten, you're
          willing    to pay twenty. Twenty,
          forty.     Forty, eighty... I'm not
          selling    till I know exactly where the
          ceiling    is.
Whereupon we see who he's talking to:     Ling.
<b>                        CHAMBERS
</b>          You like foreplay?
<b>                        LING
</b>          How much money do you want for the
          stones?
<b>                         CHAMBERS
</b>          I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up
          drills -- girl's gotta get in there
          and be ready to score points. Bring
          it straight to the motherfucking
          hoop. You understand?
                  (beat)
          So, instead of us going back and
          forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for
          you to think of a number. A very
          high number. A very final number. A
          number so high and final it'll get me
          off good, bam, right when I hear it.
Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time.       Still isn't
looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When...
<b>
</b><b>                                                             61.
</b>
Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And...
Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers
doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a
big man.

But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and
quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's
finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the
blood and swelling --

<b>                          CHAMBERS
</b>          Okay, okay...
Ling stops.

<b>                        CHAMBERS
</b>          Ain't worth my life... I'll take the
          five and call it a game.

<b>INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE CHAMBERS' CELL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets. Closing
the blankets behind him. To the sentries, who've heard
nothing --
<b>                         LING
</b>          Mr. Chambers is resting.   He says not
          to bother him.
OFF which, as Ling walks away...

<b>INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY
</b>FIND Chambers. No one will bother him. Ever.       The lobster
fork driven deep into the base of his skull.

<b>INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
</b>Archie still looking for the man with the diamond
pinkie-ring. Su still following.

</b>          I'll handle it.
In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's
unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning
airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better.

</b>The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike.
<b>                        RING ANNOUNCER
</b>          Seven advances, eleven's out...
          Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight
          versus twelve. Fighters report to
          the cage.
As Archie and Su continue the search --
<b>                        ARCHIE
</b>          You're after the stones, too, huh?
No response from Su.   Beat.
<b>                        ARCHIE
</b>          ... I did some more checking around
          to see what anyone knows about 'em...
          Guess who get back to me? My Defense
          Department connection. Now, I think
          he's calling me about this surplus F-
          14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands
          on. But no. Turns out he's calling
          to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan
          about black stones --
In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the
midget calls out --
<b>                         RING ANNOUNCER
</b>          Number twelve!
<b>                        ARCHIE

</b>          Number twelve!
<b>                         ARCHIE
</b>          They're --
Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB
FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out --
<b>                        FIGHT CLUB FAN
</b>          Twelve's right here!
Su pulls his arm back.
<b>                        FIGHT CLUB FAN
</b>          I'd be scared of him, too.
Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the
first time. The Bruiser's beckoning.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            63.
</b><b>                        BRUISER

Su waves them off.
<b>                          SU
</b>          Not today...
The catcalls start.    Archie leans into Su.
<b>                           ARCHIE
</b>          I know it    wasn't the plan. But if
          you don't    fight, they're gonna toss
          us out on    our asses. We might never
          find the    guy.

A long beat.    Su hates this place.   Su hates Archie.

<b>INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
</b>Fait's in handcuffs. A big cut on his head. Being escorted
by two COPS to the stairs leading out of the club. To
Odion, as they pass him --

</b>          He's pretty beat up.
<b>                        ODION

</b>          Better have the E.M.T.s look at his
          head.

<b>CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK
</b>His cuffed hands.    Fingers feeling the inside of his belt.
Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the
leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out
recess in the belt. Where...
Fait has a hidden handcuff key.

<b>CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS
</b>struggling against their duct-tape bonds.   REVEAL...

<b>INT. CAMPER - DAY
</b>Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's
tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON
nearby, but she's not watching.
Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape.
Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and
scared.

<b>INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
</b>DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight
leaves his corner and advances on Su.
Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to
buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly
running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment,
gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and
misses. Until...
Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately
it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch
carries him headfirst into a metal post.
Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight,
Su uses the chance to find...

</b>Number eight's on his feet.    Moving in again.   When...

<b>ARCHIE
</b>Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring.


<b>SU
</b>dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling
he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A
solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight.
Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows.
<b>                          SU
</b>          You win.
Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its
disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's
path.
<b>                          RING ANNOUNCER
</b>          No quitting.    Get back in there.
Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting
fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the
cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.

<b>HOT DOG STAND - DAY
</b>Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two     extreme MOTO-RIDERS
dressed in leathers have pulled up    in a truck and gotten out
to eat. In the back of the truck     is a motorcycle and a
four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle     Daria. To her --

talking outside. Sees the hot dog stand in b.g. Sees the

Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside --

A Cop calls inside to Fait.

Fait stands.     Starts out.   Into his mike --

</b>          Get ready to move.
And we see...
The handcuffs aren't on him anymore.

<b>EXT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Fait reaches the rear doorway.      When...
He jumps. Knocks one Cop down.      Shoves another aside.   And
takes off running.
Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise. It takes a
few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others
by car.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE

To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on --

</b>          Get the car.     Stay close.
As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into
the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION.
The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening.

</b><b>                                                           67.
</b>
<b>                          MOTO-RIDER #1
</b>          Hey!
Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck.   Right
through the nylon mesh tailgate.

Fait flies from the truck bed. Lands on the hood of a
police car. Gets big air off the windshield. Clears the
rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels.
As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto-
Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the
remaining motorcycle. His friend calls to him --
<b>                        MOTO-RIDER #1
</b>          Don't let that fucker get away!
The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into
first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in
pursuit.

<b>INT. CAMPER - DAY
</b>Vanessa still taped up.    TV still ON.   When...
<b>                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
</b>          ... We go now to this breaking
          story...
<b>ANGLE TO INCLUDE TV
</b>Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the ATV.
<b>                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
</b>          ... You're watching a man on an all-
          terrain vehicle leading police in a
          high-speed chase through downtown Los
          Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says
          the man, Anthony Fait --
Vanessa looks over in surprise.
<b>                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
</b>           -- commandeered the A.T.V. after
          escaping from police officers while
          being treated at a local hospital for
          injuries resulting from his earlier
          arrest for robbery... And this is
          certainly one of the wildest chases
          we've witnessed here in L.A...

<b>EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                               68.
</b>WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets,
sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't.
Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's
fast, strong and maneuverable.


One problem: so is the moto-cross bike.     The guy's right on
Fait's ass. Matching move with move.
Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While
on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path.
But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an
escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At
another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure.
This'll be a news highlight for days to come.


<b>INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
</b>The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on
the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su
versus the five fighters. And the midget.
The different fighters use different fighting styles against
Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street
fighting...
Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one
point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another
opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a
fighting staff.
One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition.

<b>EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</b>Fait's everywhere.   And so is the moto-bike.   Still on his
tail.
Fait veers inside a building.   The bike follows.

<b>INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS SHOTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs.   One floor.   Two
floors. Up and up.
Fait reaches the top-floor hallway.   Nowhere left to go
except...
Out the window at the end.   And...
That's just where he goes.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              69.
</b>And where he goes, the moto-bike goes.

<b>EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS
</b>The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap.    Onto the
roof of a next-door building.
From there, it's rooftop to rooftop.    Jump after jump.
Longer and longer. Until...
The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH.     The moto-
rider walks away, but his chase is over.

<b>EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</b>
Fait's ATV SCREAMS down another street, still chased by
cops. Into his mike --
<b>                          FAIT
</b>           Yo.

</b>           Get there.

<b>INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
</b>It's down to Su and the kick boxer.    The kick boxer spins
and kicks and punches, and...
Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes.    Ties him into a
pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then...
Looks for Archie.     Can't find him. Can't find the guy
wearing the ring.     And hurries out of the cage.

<b>EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
</b>Fait jukes the ATV in the entrance.    Up the spiral ramp.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             70.
</b>
Moments later, police CARS SKID up and seal the entrance.

<b>INT. CAMPER - DAY
</b>
On TV, a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police.
<b>                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

          end here, as police seal off the
          building...
OFF Vanessa, watching...


<b>INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
</b>Su runs into the parking area. Archie's in the T-bird.
Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front.
<b>                         SU
</b>          Where is he?
<b>                        ARCHIE

</b>          Right here.
Su looks inside the car.

<b>ANGLE - CAR
</b>Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring.
Holding a STUN GUN to the guy's cheek.
<b>                        ARCHIE
</b>          Good thing I brought my stunner.
He ZAPS the air.    Then puts it back to the guy's cheek.
<b>                        ARCHIE
</b>          Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?

<b>INT. CAMPER - DAY
</b>On TV, the chopper zooms in on a familiar car, as it rolls
down the exit ramp toward the police barricade.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                71.

          ramp...
We see the police approach the car.

</b>          ... The police apparently talking to
          the driver...
The police let the car pass.
<b>                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
</b>          ... Now letting this car drive on as
          the search inside continues...

Vanessa notices something about the car.     Looks carefully.
When...
The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle
of the people inside, and...
Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy.
Which could mean only one thing:    her daddy's safe.   And
soon he'll be coming to get her.
With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape,
Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct-
tape bonds. When, just as it's about to seem hopeless
again, her eyes go to...
Her necklace.   The chain and pink diamond pendant.
Vanessa bends over    and lowers her head until the necklace
slides off onto the    bed. Then turns around and  picks up the
necklace behind her    back. Holding it as taut as  she can
between her hands,    she begins sawing away at the tape around
her wrists.

<b>EXT. NEAR KOREAN CLUB - HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT
</b>The gang's all here.    All eyes on the club.
<b>                        FAIT

          Place is slamming nonstop.
A long beat.    Fait doesn't answer.

</b>          Something isn't right.

                  (then)
          Everyone stay put.
OFF which, as he and Su go --


<b>INT. KOREAN CLUB - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
</b>MUSIC pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down
the hall toward Chambers' office.
<b>                        FAIT
</b>          No Chambers' guys.     I don't get it.
They reach the closed office door, where they stop and
listen. Hear nothing.
Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look.     Then Su opens
the door.

<b>INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find...
Odion and the other Chambers' men.    Dead.   Skull shot.
<b>                          FAIT
</b>          I get it now.
Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain,
where he reaches into the water and begins searching the
rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then --
<b>                        FAIT
</b>          Are they there?
Su doesn't answer, still searching.
<b>                        FAIT
</b>          No. This can't fucking happen.      They
          gotta be there.
Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up:         one
black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                 73.

</b>             Vanessa...
                     (then, trying)
             He has the stones. There's      no reason
             to keep her. Hell, she's a      little
             girl, she's eight years old     -- she
             can't hurt him. He can let      her go...
             He can just fucking let her     go...
Su just looks at him.        Not a chance.   And he knows Fait
knows it, too.
It's over.     For Fait, it's as if his life just ended.
<b>                           FAIT

</b>             ... We need to go.
Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage,
and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the
fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of
exotica, destroying it.
Beat.   Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes.          Then --

</b>Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace   as a saw to free her
wrists from the duct-tape. She quickly    rips the tape from her
mouth. Untapes her ankles. Then tries     to figure out what to do
next. Begins searching the camper for    anything that might help
her escape or fight. When...
Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An
old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out
exactly what it is. Then she pushes "Power," and...
The phone turns on.    Sort of.

"Low Batt" flashes on the screen.
<b>INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>Rock bottom.

Fait's desolate, sitting on the sofa, staring off.      Daria
tries to comfort him, but it doesn't help.
Miles and Tommy stay close and stay silent.
Even Archie's quiet for once.
The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chinese
to someone who is obviously his superior.

An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying
the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly
muscle. Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new
arrivals.

In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale. There are
five buyers -- one RUSSIAN, one AFRICAN, one PAKISTANI, one
EGYPTIAN, one FRENCH. The French Buyer is in a wheelchair.
Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one
to three bodyguards.
Vanessa SHIFTS her VIEW, REVEALING...

Charles turns, and...

<b>INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
</b><b>                        LING
</b>          You're the world's foremost arms
          dealers. You all know that weaponry
          equals power. And in the world of
          weaponry, nukes rule.

</b><b>                        LING (CONT'D)
</b>          But nuclear material is hard to
          obtain and difficult to handle... But
          what if it weren't?... That's the
          question that brought you here
          tonight... And here's the answer.
Ling holds up a single stone.
<b>                        LING
</b>          In its present state, it's completely
          inert. Zero radiation, zero
          volatility...
Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a
table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard
with a mallet.
He unfolds the velvet.   The stone's smashed to pieces.
Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who
places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then
inserts the capsule into his contraption.
<b>                         RUSSELL
</b>          Goggles on.
Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and
the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver
of stone, which begins to glow.
Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical
readout on the contraption races up the scale --
<b>                        RUSSELL
</b>          ... Firecracker... .44 magnum...
          R.P.G... Sidewinder... SCUD...

As the buyers absorb this...

Russell shuts off the beams.
<b>                           RUSSELL
</b>           Goggles off.
Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who
holds it up.
<b>                            LING
</b>           One small    fragment. Transformed into
           a source    of immense energy. More
           powerful    than weapons-grade plutonium
           a hundred    times its size.
A beat as this sinks in.
<b>                         SONA
</b>           The purpose of today's sale is to
           begin trading a new commodity on the

           available in the first sale. The
           opening price is one million per
           stone... Bids, please?
The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand
signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the
same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators.
Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a
laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market-
analysis for Sona to consult.
The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel
out the situation.

takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns
the gun on Su.
Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd
just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees

</b>Ling getting into the limo.    To Archie and   Tommy, as he
signals --
<b>                        SU
</b>          Don't let him get away!

As a result of which...

<b>TOMMY AND ARCHIE
</b>Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50
is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine
gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING
away.


<b>LIMO
</b>Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH
HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as
the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.
INTERCUT WITH which...

<b>SU AND SONA
</b>Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.
He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the
inevitable. When...
WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from
Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed
limo
<b>                          DARIA
</b>          Get him.
Su goes after Ling.
And now it's Daria vs. Sona.
Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her
side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the
Scorpion. She swings it up. And...
Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes
Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the
SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips
through her chest and kills her.
And now, here's what's been going on outside...

<b>EXT. AIRFIELD

</b><b>                                                                91.
</b>
As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the
tarmac into the darkness of the airfield...

<b>MILES
</b>
flips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.    And...

<b>SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
</b>Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is
closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND him. PHUT!


<b>CHARLES
</b>The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.    Charles is slowed
but keeps going.

<b>SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
</b>Charles reaches the flight line. Parked planes, a gas
truck, a shed, etc. He disappears behind the equipment.

<b>MILES
</b>sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa.     He comms
Fait.
<b>                        MILES
</b>          Lost 'em behind the gas truck.

<b>CHARLES
</b>stops behind the gas truck.   Looks around for Vanessa.    No
sign of her. Until...
Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all
the way. He whips it open. And...
There's Vanessa, hiding inside.
Charles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking.
<b>                        CHARLES
</b>          Time to end this my way.
And then...
<b>                        FAIT (O.S.)
</b>          Drop the girl.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              92.
</b>
Charles looks over.    Fait is there, holding a gun on him.
Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father.
<b>                          FAIT
</b>          Put her down.
Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground.    He releases her.
<b>                          VANESSA
</b>          Daddy!
Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a
little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...

Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind
her. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.
Charles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.
Fait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait
stays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little
girl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly
unstoppable force.
The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through
struts.

<b>SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
</b>Fait, Charles and Vanessa.    No clear shot.

<b>MILES
</b>comms Fait.
<b>                          MILES
</b>          No shot.

<b>FAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSA
</b>The fight continues.   Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal
attack. When...
Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane.   They fall.
Charles moves in. And...
Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's
wheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by
a length of nylon rope.
Fait turns to Vanessa.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            93.
</b><b>                         FAIT
</b>          Don't move.
Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite
like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of
Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat
the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight
back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.
The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...
A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is
unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over
Charles. Tosses the chocks down.
<b>                          FAIT
</b>          Wrong kid.    Wrong dad.

Fait turns. He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding.
He scoops her up. And... Father and daughter hold each
other tight. Forever. During all of which, also INTERCUT...

<b>EXT. HANGAR
</b>Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs
out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the
other, carrying the buyers away.
The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting
for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a
bodyguard.
Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips
over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.

<b>INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
</b>Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head.
<b>                         LING
</b>          Go!

<b>EXT. HANGAR
</b>Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.

<b>EXT. AIRFIELD
</b>The Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the
helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft. Jumps. Just
in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                 94.
</b><b>EXT. AGUSTA
</b>As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to
get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process,
he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly.


<b>INT. AGUSTA
</b>Ling hears the THUMPS.    Looks out.

<b>LING'S POV - SU'S LEG
</b>swinging beneath the Agusta.


<b>LING
</b>To the pilot --
<b>                          LING
</b>            Retract the gear!

<b>CLOSEUP - CONTROL PANEL
</b>The pilot hits the wheels-up switch.     And...

<b>SU
</b>The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of
the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold.
<b>                          SU
</b>            Shoot it down!   Now!
And then... Su lets go.      Drops fifteen feet to the ground.
As...
Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams
tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.

<b>INT. TANK
</b>Archie aims the cannon.
<b>                          TOMMY
</b>            Can you hit it?
<b>                           ARCHIE
</b>            No problem.   Absolutely... Load.
Tommy slides a shell into the breech.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                95.
</b>
Archie's locked on.     He hits the trigger.   And...

<b>ABRAMS TANK
</b>
BOOM!   The big CANNON FIRES.      And...

<b>SKY
</b>The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.

<b>INT. TANK
</b>
Archie and Tommy exult.
<b>                          TOMMY
</b>            Shot him right in the ass.
<b>                           ARCHIE
</b>            I did it.   I can't believe it.
<b>                          TOMMY
</b>            Thought you said it was no problem.
<b>                          ARCHIE
</b>            What do I know?

<b>INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
</b>The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from
crashing.

<b>EXT. AIRFIELD
</b>The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the
hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,
ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it
caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle
around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING
<b>INTO FLAMES.
</b>The spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With
Su in the middle.
The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the
circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.
Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones.
Su is waiting.
<b>                          LING
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                          96.
</b>          You were lucky last time.   You
          Won't be lucky again.
The final fight begins.
The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,
using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the
equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.
For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...
Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes
and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.
<b>                        LING
</b>          I'll kill you fast.    You won't
          Feel a thing.

<b>                          SU
</b>          ... I won't.    You will
What happens next happens in an instant:
Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it.
A direction it can't go.
Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.
Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic
Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
Ling's pocket. And...
Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,
choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-
stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.
Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --
<b>                        SU
</b>          This is for our friends.
And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand
blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...

<b>INSIDE LING'S THROAT
</b>The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing
white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's
super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand
microwave ovens turned on all at once.
Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...

<b>ANGLE BACK ON LING
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                             97.
</b>
As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks
from the inside out.
Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and
darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his
skeleton. Human jerky.
In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains
topple over. Su has closed a chapter.

<b>SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>Su and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's
holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms. SIRENS APPROACH in
b.g.
The two men regard each other a moment.
<b>                         FAIT
</b>          We got it all.
                  (then)
          What happens to the stones?
<b>                        SU
</b>          They'll be destroyed.
They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive
in b.g.
<b>                        FAIT
</b>          Looks like I'll be doing some jail
          time.
<b>                       TOMMY
</b>          Jail? Man, you just helped save the
          planet. Law's gotta allow for that.
A look between Fait and Su.   Su nods.
<b>                        SU
</b>          I'll do what I can.
<b>                        ARCHIE
</b>          That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a
          helluva team, y'know?
                  (to Su)
          Well, not you, 'cause you're law
          enforcement. But the rest of us
          -- look, a white guy comes in handy
          now and then. Y'know, if you're
          pulling a job in Beverly Hills or
          ripping off a country club or
          whatever... What kind of percentage
          are we talking?

</b><b>                                                                98.
</b>
<b>                         FAIT
</b>          We're not.
Fait looks at Vanessa again.     Finding a new purpose in her
eyes. Beat.

<b>                        FAIT
</b>          Time I got real.
He regards the others.
<b>                        FAIT
</b>          Time we all did.
<b>                          ARCHIE
</b>          Get real?    What's that mean?
<b>                        TOMMY
</b>          ... Means we're through with that
          life.
Fait's eyes meet Tommy's.     Beat.   Tommy nods.
Fait looks to Daria for her answer.
<b>                        DARIA
</b>          I'm with you, T.
He looks to Miles.
<b>                        MILES
</b>          Whatever you say, man.
Fait looks back to Su.   They hold the look.
<b>                         SU
</b>          ... Good luck.
<b>                         FAIT
</b>          ... Faith.
Another beat. Then they turn and start walking toward the
arriving cop cars. Daria and Miles follow. Archie and
Tommy lag behind. As they all walk away from us --
