</b>          A phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the
          open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It
          sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty
          bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays.
<b>          EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the
          night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly,
          its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels
          sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver
          fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and
          he's in a hurry.

</b><b>          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Two figures are struggling on the floor. The male is
          naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent,
          her breath fast. They appear to be having sex.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. TRIKE. DAWN
</b><b>          
</b>          The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show
          desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering
          neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          That phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a
          bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there
          is also a man's shape, which now moves.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and
          woman are struggling. There is fear on her face.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly
          off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the
          sleep away and looks for the damn phone.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 2.

</b><b>          
</b>          The woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest
          with her fists. He is motionless underneath her.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWN
</b><b>          
</b>          The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the
          driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in
          one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped
          'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          The man finally answers the phone.   At last the ringing
          stops.
<b>                               PHIL

</b><b>          
</b>          The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking
          quickly through the room.
<b>          
</b>          As he searches, we hear:
<b>

<b>          
</b>          He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and
          glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and
          for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING
</b><b>          
</b>          The Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital.
          There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a
          reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background.
          Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks
          to the entrance.

</b>          We move through the reception area up to the nurses'
          station. Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a
          nurse's uniform.

<b>          
</b>          She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from
          under the shabby overcoat. His hair is on end. He is
          wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked
          cigar.

          Phil clears his throat.

<b>          
</b>          The nurse turns and marches down the corridor. Phil waits
          until she's gone and then walks through a door marked

          He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a
          hook and puts it on. He walks out through another door.

          left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it
          skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying
          across the road.

          enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant
          Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six
          foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets
          out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his
          pocket.

          slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. We
          see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips
          through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is

          Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a
          long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes
          kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull
          away with little success.

                         Gram Parsons wrote a song called
                         'In My Hour of Darkness', which

</b>          A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick
          burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background.
          This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a
          loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having
          heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no
          response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye
          appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears
          and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The
          window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face
          appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.

          Stanley doesn't move. He peers at Stanley and shuffles in
          his seat, but there is still no reaction. Next, a deep
          sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly
          keen to start a conversation. Stanley keeps looking out of
          the window. He is watching the cargo being loaded.

          out. Phil holds the phone away from his ear as Barbara's
          shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver. He
          watches as Larry just makes it to a cactus and is violently
          sick. He glances across to where the old melon woman
          watches, expressionless, from her stall. After a moment,
          Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car.

</b>                         The Yin Yang symbol is really
                         evocative about the whole
                         concept. As you travel around
                         the circle, white or black will
                         increase until the opposite color

</b>                    What seems like Yin is often
                    supported by Yang, and vice
                    versa. Let me give you an
                    example: To truly know good, you
                    must first know evil, and without
                    good as a comparison, nothing can
                    be evil. So by allowing Yin to
                    flourish, you welcome Yan. By
                    letting go of Yin, you are
                    waiting for its return. Another
                    example is...

                     other would come down here and
                     set them free. Gram gave his
                     word and I gave mine.

                         the lookout for a hearse. A
                         hearse is a big long car. You
                         can usually tell which ones are
                         the hearses, because they have
                         coffins in the back. The one
                         we're looking for is painted
                         yellow. Does this look like a
                         yellow hearse to you, asshole?

          FADE UP ON SUPER: Phil Kaufman and Larry Osterberg
          appeared in West L.A. Municipal Court on November 5, 1973 -
          Gram Parsons's 27th birthday. Since a corpse has no
          intrinsic value, the two were charged with misdemeanor
          theft for stealing the coffin and given a token punishment:
          $708 in damages for the coffin, and a $300 fine for each of
          the bodysnatchers.
