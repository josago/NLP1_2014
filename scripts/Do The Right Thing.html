"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America
is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown
violent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people have
not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would
have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the
democratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of
black people has so fervently continued to believe in a
turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die
philosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people
have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the
centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's
heaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro
'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with
degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off
their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black
masses quiet until now."

<b>INT: WE LOVE RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY
</b>
<b>EXTREME CLOSE UP
</b>
WE SEE only big white teeth and very Negroidal (big) lips.

<b>					MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
</b>		  Waaaake up!
		  Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up!
		  Up ya wake!  Up ya wake!  Up ya wake!

<b>CAMERA MOVES BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY,
</b>a DJ, a radio personality, behind a microphone.


<b>					MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
</b>		  This is Mister Señor Love Daddy.
		  Your voice of choice.  The world's
		  only twelve-hour strongman, here on
		  WE LOVE radio, 108 FM.  The last on
		  your dial, but the first in ya
		  hearts, and that's the truth, Ruth!

The CAMERA, which is STILL PULLING BACK, shows that Mister
Señor Love Daddy is actually sitting in a storefront window.
The control booth looks directly out onto the street.  This
is WE LOVE RADIO, a modest station with a loyal following,
right in the heart of the neighborhood.  The OPENING SHOT
will be a TRICK SHOT--the CAMERA PULLING BACK through the
storefront window.

<b>					MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
</b>		  Here I am.  Am I here?  Y'know it.
		  It ya know.  This is Mister Señor
		  Love Daddy, doing the nasty to ya
		  ears, ya ears to the nasty.  I'se
		  play only da platters dat matter,
		  da matters dat platter and that's
		  the truth, Ruth.

He hits the cart machine and we hear a station jingle.

<b>					VO
</b><b>		  L-O-V-E RADIO.

<b>					MISTER SEÑOR LOVE DADDY
</b>		  Doing da ying and yang da flip and
		  flop da hippy and hoppy
			    (he yodels)
		  Yo da lay he hoo.  I have today's
		  forecast.
			    (he screams)
<b>		  HOT!
</b>
He laughs like a madman.

<b>INT: DA MAYOR'S BEDROOM--DAY
</b>
An old, grizzled man stirs in the bed, his sheets are soaked
with sweat.  He flings them off his wet body.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Damn, it's hot.

<b>INT: JADE'S APARTMENT--DAY
</b>
CAMERA MOVES IN ON a young man sitting at the edge of a sofa
bed.

<b>CLOSE UP--HIS SMALL HANDS
</b>
WE SEE him counting his money.  This isn't any ordinary
counting of money, he's straightening out all the corners of
the bills, arranging them so the bills--actually the "dead
presidents"--are facing the same way.  This is MOOKIE.  Once
he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks
into his sister's bedroom.

<b>INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY
</b>
<b>CLOSE UP--JADE
</b>
JADE, Mookie's sister, is fast asleep.  Mookie's fingers
ENTER THE FRAME and start to play with her lips.  Jade
pushes his hands away.  Mookie waits several beats and he
continues.  Jade wakes up--mad.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Don't you have enough sense not to
		  bother people when they're sleeping?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Wake up!

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day
		  I get to sleep late.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  It's gonna be hot today.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Good!  Leave me alone when I'm
		  sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on
		  my door, to keep ya ass outta here.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Don't ya love ya brother Mookie
		  anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Do me a favor.  Go to work.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Later.  Gotta get paid.

He plants a big fat juicy on his sister's forehead.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
A 1975 El Dorado pulls up in front of the neighborhood
pizzeria--Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

From out of the car comes the owner, SAL, a slightly
overweight man in his early fifties, and his two sons, PINO,
22, and VITO, 20.  It's time for them to go to work at Sal's
Famous Pizzeria in the heart of Black Brooklyn.  Sal's sits
on the corner of The Block.  The Block being where this film
on the hottest day of the summer takes place.

Pino kicks a beer can in his path into the gutter.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Pino, get a broom and sweep out
		  front.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Vito, get a broom and sweep out
		  front.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  See, Pop.  That's just what I was
		  talkin' about.  Every single time
		  you tell Pino to do something, he
		  gives it to me.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  He's nuts.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  The both of youse, shaddup.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Tell Pino.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Get the broom.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  I ain't getting shit.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Hey!  Watch it.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  I didn't want to come to work
		  anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Can you do better?  C'mere.

Pino is now silent.  Sal walks over to him.


<b>					SAL
</b>		  Can you do better?
			    (he pops Pino upside
			    the head)
		  I didn't think so.  This is a
		  respectable business.  Nuthin'
		  wrong with it.  Get dat broom.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Tell Vito.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Pop asked you.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  I'm gonna kill somebody today.

<b>EXT: MOOKIE'S BROWNSTONE--DAY
</b>
Mookie comes down his stoop and walks to work.

<b>EXT: STREET--DAY
</b>
The Block is beginning to come to life.  Those unlucky souls
who have to work this Saturday drag themselves to it, and
the kids are out on the street to play in the hot sun all
day long.

<b>EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY
</b>
Mookie stops to say hello to MOTHER SISTER.  She leans out
her window on the parlor floor.  In the summertime, the only
time when she's not perched in her window is when she's
asleep.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Good morning, Mookie.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Good morning to you.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Now, Mookie, don't work too hard
		  today.  The man said it's gonna be
		  HOT as the devil.  I don't want ya
		  falling out from the heat.  You
		  hear me, son?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I hear ya, Mother Sister.  I hear
		  you.


<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Good.  I'll be watching ya, son.
		  Mother Sister always watches.

<b>INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Mookie enters the pizzeria and Pino is on him before the
door closes.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Mookie, late again.  How many times
		  I gotta tell you?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  How ya doin', Mookie?

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Whaddup?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Just coolin'.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  You're still late.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Pino, relax, will ya.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Here, take the broom.  The front
		  needs sweeping.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I
		  just got here.  You sweep.  I
		  betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  That's right.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Shaddup, Vito.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas.
		  That's what I get paid for.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  You get paid to do what we say.


<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  What we say.  I didn't hear Sal say
		  nuthin'.

Pino looks at his father.  He wants to be backed up on this;
all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Who's working for who?

There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Come on in, Mayor.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Good morning, gentlemens.  It's
		  gonna be a scorcher today, that's
		  for sure.  Need any work done
		  around here?

Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  It will be the cleanest sidewalk in
		  Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of
		  Health.

Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon
as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We
		  runnin' welfare or somethin'?
		  Every day you give dat bum--

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Da Mayor ain't no bum.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping
		  our sidewalk.  What do we pay
		  Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I
		  work harder than him and I'm your
		  own son.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Who don't work?  Let's see you
		  carry six large pies up six flights
		  of stairs.  No elevator either and
		  shit.


<b>					SAL
</b>		  Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a
		  place of business.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Tell 'em, Pop.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Me and you are gonna have a talk.

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Sez who?

<b>					PINO
</b>		  Sez me.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Hey!  What did I say?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Who doesn't work?  Don't start no
		  shit, won't be no shit.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Mookie, no cursing in the store.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Talk to your son.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor sweeps the sidewalk, happy as can be.  As soon as
he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle.

<b>EXT: STOOP--DAY
</b>
A group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone.  They
are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  What's keeping him?

<b>					PUNCHY
</b>		  You call him, then.

Ella stands up and yells.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Yo, Ahmad!

<b>					PUNCHY
</b>		  I coulda done dat.


<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Yo, Ahmad!

She looks up into his window, then sits down.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Punchy, if ya want to do some more
		  screaming, be my guest.  I'm too
		  through.

The door swings open at the top of the stoop and AHMAD
appears.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Who's yelling my name?

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Punchy told me to.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Don't listen to him, it will get ya
		  in trouble.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Heard that, Punchy.

Ahmad sits down with them.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Ella, you have a brain, use it.

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box.  The
sound gets louder as the box gets closer.  The youths look
down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them.
He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop.  This is
RADIO RAHEEM.  The size of his box is tremendous and one has
to think, how does he carry something that big around with
him?  It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk
shakes as the rap music blares out.  The song we hear is the
only one Radio Raheem plays.

<b>MEDIUM SHOT--RADIO RAHEEM
</b>
Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and
turns down the volume.  It's quiet again.

<b>					RADIO RAHEEM
</b>		  Peace, y'all.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Peace, Radio Raheem.

<b>					CEE
</b>		  Peace.

<b>											    10.
</b>

<b>					PUNCHY
</b>		  You the man, Radio Raheem.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  It's your world.

<b>					CEE
</b>		  In a big way.

Radio Raheem nods and turns up the volume.  Way up.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  My people.  My people.

<b>EXT: WE LOVE STOREFRONT--DAY
</b>
Radio Raheem waves to Mister Señor Love Daddy as he walks by.

<b>INT: WE LOVE CONTROL BOOTH--DAY
</b>
Mister Señor Love Daddy gives Radio Raheem a clenched-fist
salute.

<b>EXT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor walks into a newly opened fruit and vegetable deli
stand that is owned by Koreans.

<b>INT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor is looking for his beer in the refrigerated cases,
his ice-cold beer.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Where's the Bud?  Where's the Bud?

<b>					KOREAN CLERK
</b>		  No mo' Bud.  You look what we have
		  and buy.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  No more Bud.  What kind of joint is
		  this?  How come no mo' Bud?  Doctor,
		  this ain't Korea, China, or wherever
		  you come from.  Get some Budweiser
		  in this motherfucker.

<b>					KOREAN CLERK
</b>		  You buy 'nother beer.

<b>											    11.
</b>

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Alright.  Alright.  Y'know you're
		  asking a lot to make a man change
		  his beer, that's asking a lot,
		  Doctor.

<b>EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown
paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom.  He stops
and takes a long swig.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  You ole drunk.  What did I tell ya
		  about drinking in front of my stoop?
		  Move on, you're blocking my view.

Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his
heckler.  It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard
this before.  Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me.

Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  The evil eye doesn't work on me.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Mother Sister, you've been talkin'
		  'bout me the last eighteen years.
		  What have I ever done to you?

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  You're a drunk fool.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Besides that.  Da Mayor don't
		  bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother
		  Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just
		  mind his business.  I love everybody.
		  I even love you.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Hold your tongue.  You don't have
		  that much love.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  One day you'll be nice to me.  We
		  might both be dead and buried, but
		  you'll be nice.  At least civil.

<b>											    12.
</b>

Da Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a
final swig of beer just for her.

<b>INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAY
</b>
An elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her
daughter TINA in Spanish.  Tina, having heard enough, closes
the door on her mother's ranting and raving.

<b>ANGLE--TINA
</b>
Tina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the
bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts.  She talks
to her son while walking around the room.

<b>					TINA
</b>		  Hector, I shouldn't be telling you
		  this but you would find out sooner
		  or later.  Ya father ain't no real
		  father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum
		  in a hundred-dollar world.  Your
		  father is to the curb.  You're
		  smart.  I see that look on ya face.
		  You're saying if he's such a bum
		  why am I with him?  Good question.
		  Like I said before, you're no dummy.
		  He talked his way into my panties,
		  I thought being a mother would make
		  me happy, make me whole.  He's a
		  mistake, but you are not.

Tina kisses her son.  Tina is seventeen years old, another
teenage parent.

<b>EXT: STREET CORNER--DAY
</b>
Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall,
a small group of men meet.  They have no steady employment,
nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift
of gab.  These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a
bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get
philosophical.  These men become the great thinkers of the
world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the
homeless, and AIDS.  They're called the Corner Men: SWEET
DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML.  All three are sitting in
folding chairs up against a wall in the shade.

<b>					ML
</b>		  The way I see it, if this hot
		  weather continues, it will surely
		  melt the polar caps and the whole
		  wide world--the parts that ain't
		  water already--will be flooded.

<b>											    13.
</b>

<b>					COCONUT SID
</b>		  You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker.
		  Where did you read that?

<b>					ML
</b>		  Don't worry about it.  But when it
		  happens and I'm in my boat and ya
		  black ass is drowning, don't ask me
		  to throw you a lifesaver either.

<b>					SWEET DICK WILLIE
</b>		  Fool, you're thirty cents away from
		  a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?

<b>					ML
</b>		  Don't worry about it.

<b>					SWEET DICK WILLIE
</b>		  You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat
		  the holes out of donuts.

<b>					ML
</b>		  I'll be back on my feet.  Soon
		  enough.

<b>					SWEET DICK WILLIE
</b>		  So when is all this ice suppose to
		  melt?

<b>INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Customers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy.
Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of BUGGIN'
OUT, a b-boy.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  You paying now or on layaway?

Buggin' Out looks at the slice.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  How much?

<b>					SAL
</b>		  You come in here at least three
		  times a day.  You a retard?  A buck
		  fifty.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on
		  that motherfucker.

<b>											    14.
</b>

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Extra cheese is two dollars.
		  Y'know dat.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Two dollars!  Forget it!

Buggin' Out slams his money down on the counter, takes his
slice and sits down.

<b>ANGLE--TABLE
</b>
All around Buggin' Out, peering down from the WALL OF FAME,
are signed, framed, eight by ten glossies of famous Italian
Americans.  WE SEE Joe DiMaggio, Rocky Marciano, Perry Como,
Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Liza Minnelli, Governor
Mario Cuomo, Al Pacino and, of course, how can we forget
Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa: THE ITALIAN STALLION,
also RAMBO.

<b>CLOSE UP--BUGGIN' OUT
</b>
He looks at the pictures hovering above him.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Mookie.

<b>CLOSE UP--MOOKIE
</b>
<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  What?

<b>CLOSE UP--BUGGIN' OUT
</b>
<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  How come you ain't got no brothers
		  up?

<b>CLOSE UP--MOOKIE
</b>
<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Ask Sal.

<b>ANGLE--PIZZERIA
</b>
<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Sal, how come you ain't got no
		  brothers up on the wall here?

<b>					SAL
</b>		  You want brothers up on the Wall of
		  Fame, you open up your own business,
		  then you can do what you wanna do.
		  My pizzeria, Italian Americans up
		  on the wall.

<b>											    15.
</b>

<b>					VITO
</b>		  Take it easy, Pop.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Don't start on me today.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Sal, that might be fine, you own
		  this, but rarely do I see any
		  Italian Americans eating in here.
		  All I've ever seen is Black folks.
		  So since we spend much money here,
		  we do have some say.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  You a troublemaker?

Pino walks over to Buggin' Out.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  You making trouble.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Put some brothers up on this Wall
		  of Fame.  We want Malcolm X, Angela
		  Davis, Michael Jordan tomorrow.

Sal comes from behind the counter with his Louisville
Slugger Mickey Mantle model baseball bat.  Vito is by his
side, but Mookie intercepts them, and takes Buggin' Out
outside.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Don't come back, either.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  I'm cool.  I'm cool.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Come back in a week, it will be
		  squashed.

They give each other five.

<b>											    16.
</b>

<b>INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Mookie enters.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Mookie, if your friends can't
		  behave, they're not welcome.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I got no say over people.

<b>					PINO
</b>		  You talk to 'em.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  People are free to do what they
		  wanna do.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  I know, this is America, but I
		  don't want no trouble.

<b>EXT: STREET--DAY
</b>
Mookie walks down the block with pizza box in hand when he
sees Da Mayor sitting on his stoop.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Mookie.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Gotta go.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  C'mere, Doctor.

Mookie turns around and goes back.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b><b>		  OK.  OK.
</b>
<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Doctor, always try to do the right
		  thing.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  That's it?

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  That's it.

<b>											    17.
</b>

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I got it.

<b>INT: TENEMENT BUILDING--DAY
</b>
Mookie is hiking up a flight of stairs.

<b>ANGLE--STAIRCASE
</b>
He puts the pizza box down and takes a breather.

<b>CLOSE UP--MOOKIE
</b>
Sweat drips off his face.

<b>ANGLE--MOOKIE
</b>
He bends down to pick up the pizza box and tackles the last
few flights.

<b>CLOSE UP--DOORBELL
</b>
Mookie pushes the buzzer.

<b>ANGLE--DOOR
</b>
A young Puerto Rican woman opens the door.

<b>					NILDA
</b>		  I hope it's not cold.

Mookie hands her the pizza.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  No, it's not cold.  Twelve dollars
		  for the pie.

Nilda hands him a handful of singles.  Mookie looks at the
crumpled mess.  Nilda attempts to close the door, but
Mookie's foot says, "Hell no."

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Hold it.  Let me count this first.

First he straightens out the dollars, then counts the bills.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  You're short.

<b>					NILDA
</b>		  I counted the twelve dollars myself.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Twelve is right, but no tip.

<b>											    18.
</b>

<b>					NILDA
</b>		  No tip.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Look, lady.  I carried your pizza
		  up five flights of stairs and shit.
		  The cheese didn't slide over to one
		  side like it sometimes does with
		  delivery people who don't care.  I
		  do care.  May I get paid?

Nilda looks at him and sees right away he's not going
anywhere.

<b>					NILDA
</b>		  Wait here.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I'll wait.

Nilda goes into the apartment and we hear her talking in
Spanish to a male.

<b>ANGLE--MOOKIE
</b>
Mookie bends down to tie his sneakers.

<b>ANGLE--DOOR
</b>
Nilda reappears and holds out a lonely lone dollar for him.
Mookie has her hold it out for awhile, then he takes it.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Gracias mucho.

Nilda slams the door.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  A dollar!  Cheap bastard!  Your
		  pizza is gonna be fucked next time.

<b>EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY
</b>
Jade sits down next to Mother Sister on the stoop.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Jade, you're late.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here
		  now.  Where's the stuff?

Mother Sister hands her a bag that is at her side.

<b>											    19.
</b>

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Seen your brother, just walked by.

Jade unwraps a head scarf from around Mother Sister's head
and a full head of long black hair falls to her shoulders.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  This might take some time.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  I got nowhere to go.  We haven't
		  had a good sit-down for a long while.

Jade begins to part, grease, and comb out Mother Sister's
hair.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Tender-headed runs in my family.
		  You tender-headed?

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Yeah, me too.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  That's why I don't fool with it.
		  Only let you touch it...Ouch!

<b>					JADE
</b>		  Sorry, comb got caught.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is
		  an old woman.

<b>					JADE
</b>		  How are you holding up in this
		  weather?

<b>					MOTHER SISTER

<b>HOT, HOTTER AND HOTTEST MONTAGE

Right now, folks, we're gonna suspend the narrative and show
how people are coping with the oppressive heat.

People are taking cold showers.

Sticking faces in ice-cold, water-filled sinks.

Heads stuck in refrigerators.

A wife tells her husband, "Hell no, I'm not cooking.  It's
too hot.  The kitchen is closed."

Men downing six-packs of ice-cold brew.

Faces stuck directly in front of fans.

A young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac.  The moment the
egg hits the car hood it starts to cook.  The kid looks
directly INTO THE CAMERA and smiles, then looks up to see
Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him.

And how can I forget the papers, the newspaper headlines.

			  New York Post: "A SCORCHER"

POW!  A powerful gush of water flies out RIGHT AT THE CAMERA.

Ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white
stream of water flies across the street.

This attracts all the people of the block.  It's a chance to
cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat.

<b>ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY
</b>
They both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk.

</b>
She stands with caution away from the fire hydrant.  Ella
does not want to get wet.

<b>ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY
</b>
They're still scraping away.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
Folks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play.

<b>ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY
</b>
Both now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the
johnny pump.  Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and
places the can over the water.  The can now directs the
water into giant streams.

<b>ANGLE--ELLA
</b>
Ahmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up.  She's kicking
and screaming furiously.

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  Ahmad!  Put me down!  Put me down!
		  I can't get wet!  I'm not playing!

Ahmad is not having it.  He carries a kicking Ella into the
middle of the street in direct line of fire.

<b>					AHMAD
</b>		  Yo!

<b>					ELLA
</b>		  No!

They both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to
the bone.  Ella starts to punch Ahmad, and chases after him.

We hear the familiar rap music of Radio Raheem's box.

Radio Raheem is too cool.  By the way he's dressed, it could
be fall, not the hottest day of the year.  But you could
never tell it from him.  He's too cool.

Raheem looks at Cee, he wants to get by and he doesn't want
to get wet either.  And if his box gets wet, somebody is
gonna die.  Cee knows this too.

</b>
Cee stands in front of the hydrant, blocking the water so
Radio Raheem can pass.

He slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch.  When
he's clear, Cee moves and the water gushes out again as
folks play.

the vehicle speeds through the spray.

The people all move to the car, for they know what is about
to happen.

<b>ANGLE--HYDRANT
</b>
Cee and Punchy leap off the hydrant, unleashing a jet blast
that flies directly into Charlie's car.  The whole block is
dying.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
Charlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb, jumps out,
and runs to get hold of Cee and Punchy.  Of course, he's
slow, as the kids turn into track stars and make like Carl
Lewis.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
Charlie, a wet mess, tries to buy some sympathy from the
folks; none is to be bought.

<b>					CHARLIE
</b>		  I'm fucking soaked.  If I ever
		  catch those fucks they'll be sorry.
		  Cocksucking sonabitches!

The ranting continues, and people laugh at him.

<b>					CHARLIE
</b>		  You people make me sick.

A cop car screeches to a halt in front of the man.  Two
officers, LONG and PONTE, get out.

<b>					CHARLIE
</b>		  Officers, I want an arrest made.
		  Now.

</b>		  What happened?

		  They ran the fuck away.

</b>		  Do you wish to file a complaint?

</b>		  A complaint.  I want those fucks

Officer Long goes into his car and gets a wrench.

</b>
Officer Long turns off the hydrant, then puts the cap back on.

<b>					OFFICER PONTE
</b>		  This hydrant better not come back
		  on or there's gonna be hell to pay.

<b>					CHARLIE
</b>		  What about my car?  I want justice.

Officer Long sides up to Da Mayor who's been looking on.

<b>					OFFICER LONG
</b>		  You know anything about this?

Da Mayor is quiet.

<b>					CHARLIE
</b>		  He knows.  He's a witness.  They
		  all know.  He saw the whole thing.

Officer Ponte goes to Da Mayor's other side.

<b>					OFFICER LONG
</b>		  Who were the punks?

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Those who'll tell don't know.
		  Those who know won't tell.

<b>											    26.
</b>

<b>					OFFICER PONTE
</b>		  A wise guy.

Mookie emerges from the crowd and leads Da Mayor away from
the interrogation.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Let's go, Mayor.

<b>					OFFICER LONG
</b>		  Keep this hydrant off.  You want to
		  swim, go to Coney Island.

<b>					CHARLIE
</b>		  He's leaving?  What about me?

<b>					OFFICER PONTE
</b>		  I suggest you get in your car
		  quick, before these people start to
		  strip it clean.

The man looks at the crowd of Blacks and Puerto Ricans
around him and he considers what he just heard.

<b>					OFFICER LONG
</b>		  Let's go, break it up.  Go back to
		  your jobs.

<b>					OFFICER PONTE
</b>		  What jobs?

Both cops laugh.

On a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking
cerveza frío, and playing dominoes.  One of their cars is
parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music.

<b>ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM
</b>
As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but
underneath the salsa music.  Radio Raheem does not like to
be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him
competition, this is no good.  Radio Raheem stands in front
of the stoop and raises his decibel level.

<b>ANGLE--STOOP
</b>
The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him
in Spanish.  There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing
in a deafening roar.  One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the
stoop and goes to the car.

<b>ANGLE--CAR
</b>
Stevie turns the car radio off.

<b>CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem smiles, nods, turns his box to a reasonable
listening level, and bops down the block.  Radio Raheem
still the loudest.  Radio Raheem still the king.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Not only did you knock me down, you

This commotion has attracted a crowd, including Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella.

<b>					CLIFTON
</b>		  I own a brownstone on this block.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Who told you to buy a brownstone on

The crowd likes that one and they laugh and egg him on.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  What do you want to live in a Black
		  neighborhood for?  Motherfuck
		  gentrification.

<b>					CLIFTON
</b>		  I'm under the assumption that this

</b>

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  A free country?

AWWW SHIT!  Why did he get Buggin' started?

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT

Buggin' Out looks down at his marred Air Jordans.  The
crowd, smelling blood, wants to see some.

</b>		  He's dissing you.

</b>		  Damn, my brand-new Jordans.  You

Vito stands frozen in front of his brother.

Da Mayor is walking down the street.

We hear the familiar tune from the Mister Softee truck as it
comes down the street.

</b>
Eddie, the young kid who earlier ran an errand for Da Mayor,
looks up from the sidewalk where he's playing and runs out
into the street in pursuit of Mister Softee.

Eddie is running in pursuit of the truck, unaware of the
oncoming speeding car.

<b>ANGLE--DA MAYOR
</b>
Da Mayor sees speeding car bearing down on Eddie.

<b>ANGLE--STREET

Da Mayor runs across the street and knocks Eddie down, out
of the way of the car.  Both are thrown as they are hit by
the reckless driver.

<b>CLOSE--EDDIE AND DA MAYOR
</b>
Eddie is crying as Da Mayor picks him up.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Doctor, you know better to run out
		  in the street... Stop crying, son.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
A crowd gathers.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Doctor, there's nothing to cry
		  about.  You're OK.

A woman in her twenties, LOUISE, Eddie's mother, breaks
through the crowd and hugs her baby.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  What's wrong?

<b>											    61.
</b>

<b>					EDDIE
</b>		  Mayor knocked me down.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  You should be ashamed of yourself.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Ma'am, the boy is just scared to
		  death.  What actually happened is
		  that I was minding my business when
		  I saw your son about to be run over.
		  I ran into the street to save him
		  and I had to knock him down to keep
		  the both of us from getting hit.

The crowd agrees "That's the way it happened," and Louise
stands up.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  Eddie, is that the truth?

Eddie is quiet.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  Eddie, you hear me talkin' to you?

Eddie is still mum.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  I'm talkin' to you, boy.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Miss, the boy is fine.

WHAP!  Louise hits Eddie on da butt.  Eddie starts to dance,
as his mother hits hard; she's heavy-handed.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  What I tell you 'bout lying?

<b>WHOP!
</b>
<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  What did I tell you 'bout playing
		  in the street?

<b>WHAP!
</b>

</b>		  Mommy!  Mommy!  I'm sorry.  I'm
		  sorry.

<b>WHOP!

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  Get upstairs now.

Eddie runs away.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  And when your father comes home,
		  he's gonna wear ya little narrow
		  behind out too.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  You didn't have to hit your son;
		  he's scared to death as it was.

<b>					LOUISE
</b>		  I appreciate ya helping my Eddie.
		  I truly do, but I'll have nobody
		  question how I raise him, not even
		  his Daddy.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  You're right.

Louise goes away, probably to give her son another
"whooping."  Da Mayor tips his hat to her.

light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and
tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well,
not tonight, it's hot.  All the residents of The Block: the
Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc., all the
people WE'VE SEEN throughout the day are now coping with the
night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit.  Everyone is

All three look at each other.  The horror is on their faces,
with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons
Famous Pizzeria, trapped for the rest of their lives.  Is
this their future?  It's a frightening thought.

OH NO!  We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box.  As
everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and
Radio Raheem are inside already.  We have never heard the
rap music as loud as it is now.  You have to scream to be

Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie
takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  Why it gotta be about jungle music
		  and Africa?

<b>					SAL
</b>		  It's about turning that shit off

</b>		  This is music.  My music.

</b>		  We're closed.

<b>					BUGGIN' OUT
</b>		  You're closed alright, till you get

Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter
and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again
and again.  The music stops.

<b>CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX
</b>
Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens.
It's going to the junkyard quick.

<b>ANGLE--PIZZERIA
</b>
There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by
the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey
Mantle bat.  All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is
about to happen.

<b>ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM
</b>
Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.

<b>					RADIO RAHEEM
</b>		  My music!

Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts
to choke his ass.  Radio Raheem's prized possession--his
box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one
thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to
bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of
materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't
give a fuck anymore.  He's gonna make Sal pay with his life.

Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his
grip around Sal's neck.  Buggin' Out tries to help his
friend.  Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella cheerlead.

The people on The Block run to Sal's Famous Pizzeria to see
the STATIC.

<b>ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA
</b>
Radio Raheem, Buggin' Out, Sal, Vito, and Pino are still
entangled, rolling around on the sidewalk, but now before an
entertained crowd of onlookers:

<b>ANGLE--DA MAYOR
</b>
<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Break it up.  This is crazy.

The fight continues.  Da Mayor is smart enough not to get in
the middle of this war.  We hear sirens, somebody has called
<b>DA COPS.
</b>
<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
<b>											    80.
</b>

The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running
over some people.  The cops get out with nightsticks and
guns drawn.  WE RECOGNIZE two of the faces, Officers Long
and Ponte.  Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man
and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are
gonna go for.  You know the deal!  Buggin' Out is pulled off
first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man.
It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a
beet from being choked.

<b>ANGLE--COPS
</b>
Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other
cops put a choke hold on Radio Raheem to restrain him.

<b>ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM
</b>
Radio Raheem is still struggling, then he just stops, his
body goes limp and he falls to the sidewalk like a fifty-
pound bag of Idaho potatoes.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
Officers Long and Ponte kick him.

<b>					OFFICER LONG
</b>		  Get up!  Get up!

Radio Raheem just lies there like a bump on a log.

<b>ANGLE--CROWD
</b>
The crowd stares at Radio Raheem's still body.  He's
unconscious or dead.

<b>CLOSE--OFFICER LONG
</b>
<b>					OFFICER LONG
</b>		  Quit faking.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
The officers all look at each other.  They know, they know
exactly what they've done.  The infamous Michael Stewart
choke hold.

<b>					OFFICER PONTE
</b>		  Let's get him outta here.

The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him
into the back seat.  Buggin' Out is pushed into another car.
The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have
left the crowd.  It's at this point the crowd becomes an
angry mob.

</b>

<b>ANGLE--MOB
</b>
The mob looks at...

<b>ANGLE--MOB POV
</b>
Sal still on the sidewalk, being helped to his feet by Vito
and Pino, who are in bad shape themselves.

<b>ANGLE--MOB
</b>
The mood/tone of the mob is getting ugly.  Once again they
have seen one of their own killed before their eyes at the
hands of the cops.  We hear the murmurs of the folks go
through the crowd.

<b>					VOICES OF MOB
</b><b>		  THEY KILLED HIM
</b><b>		  THEY KILLED RADIO RAHEEM
</b><b>		  IT'S MURDER
</b><b>		  DID IT AGAIN

</b><b>		  IT'S NOT SAFE
</b><b>		  NOT EVEN IN OUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD
</b><b>		  IT'S NOT SAFE
</b><b>		  NEVER WAS
</b><b>		  NEVER WILL BE
</b>
The cops, in their haste to get Radio Raheem out of there,
have left an angry mob of Black folks with a defenseless
Sal, Vito, and Pino.

The mob looks at them.

<b>					VOICES OF MOB

He leaves Sal and his two sons.

Da Mayor walks in front of the crowd.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Good people, let's all go home.
		  Somebody's gonna get hurt.

<b>					CROWD (OS)
</b>		  Yeah, you!

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  If we don't stop this now, we'll
		  all regret it.  Sal and his two

<b>					CROWD (OS)
</b>		  Get out of the way, old man.  You a

<b>					DA MAYOR

Mookie picks up a garbage can and dumps it out into the
street.  He walks through the crowd, up to Da Mayor, Sal,
Vito, and Pino.

<b>CLOSE--MOOKIE
</b>
He screams.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b><b>		  HATE!!!!
</b>
<b>SLOW MOTION
</b>
Mookie hurls the garbage can through the plate glass window
of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.  That's it.  All hell breaks loose.
The dam has been unplugged, broke.  The rage of a people has
been unleashed, a fury.  A lone garbage can thrown through
the air has released a tidal wave of frustration.

<b>ANGLE--STREET
</b>
Da Mayor pushes Sal, Vito, and Pino out of the way as the
mob storms into Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

<b>INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

The people rush into Sal's Famous Pizzeria, tearing it up.

The cash register is opened.  WE SEE only coins, Sal has the
paper.

<b>EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT
</b>
Da Mayor leads Sal, Vito, and Pino back to his stoop where
they watch in horror.

</b>
Sal's Famous Pizzeria is going up in flames and now it's a
carnival.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Burn it down.  Burn it down.

One might have thought that the elders--who through the
years have been broken down, whipped, their spirits crushed,
beaten into submission--would be docile, strictly onlookers.
That's not true except for Da Mayor.  The rest of the elders
are right up in it with the young people.

fruit and vegetable stand.  Sweet Dick Willie, Coconut Sid,
and ML stand at the head of the mob.

He's scared to death, as the mob is poised to tear his place
up too.  The clerk wildly swings a broom to hold them off.

The wail of fire trucks and police sirens is now added to
the night.

The mob moves back to in front of Sal's as the fire trucks
and police, in full riot gear, pull up in the street behind
them.

<b>					POLICE LOUDSPEAKER (VO)
</b>		  Good people.  Please disperse.
		  Please disperse.

The firemen rush to hook up their hoses, the police force
themselves between the crowd and the burning Sal's Famous
Pizzeria.

<b>					POLICE LOUDSPEAKER (VO)
</b>		  Please disperse!  Please disperse!

The mob doesn't listen, they will not be moved.  The mob
will not be moved until they see Sal's Famous Pizzeria burn
to the ground.

<b>ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA

The firemen douse the pizzeria, trying desperately to stop
the fire from spreading into the adjoining buildings.

WE SEE Mookie, Mother Sister, Sweet Dick Willie, ML, Coconut
Sid, Jade, Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella, etc., go down
before the powerful blast of the firehouse.

Now we've come full circle.  We're back to Montgomery or
Birmingham, Alabama.  The only thing missing is Sheriff Bull
Connor and the German shepherds.

It would take force to move them and that's exactly what the
mob got.  People are trying to hold on to each other, cars,
railings, anything to keep from being swept away.

<b>EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT

Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino watch in disbelief.  It's
unbelievable what is happening before their eyes.

Jade and Mother Sister try to hold on to a streetlamp as a

As WE MOVE IN TIGHTER ON the melted box, we begin to hear
the rap song that we've hear throughout.  All other sound
drops as the rap song gets louder and louder until it's
deafening.

<b>ANGLE--SMILEY

Smiley sits up from where he hid during the burning and
looting of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.  Smiley looks around and
goes directly to the smoldering Wall of Fame.  He stands
there.  Smiley pins one of his Malcolm X/Martin Luther King,

The CAMERA, FROM HIGH ABOVE, CRANES DOWN ON The Block.  The
sidewalk is deserted, broken glass is everywhere, and it
looks exactly as how one expects it to look, the morning
after an uprising.

The CAMERA NOW MOVES IN ON the WE LOVE storefront where
Mister Señor Love Daddy is in his familiar place behind the
mike.

Mookie leaves.

<b>MOTHER SISTER'S BEDROOM--DAY

Da Mayor wakes up in Mother Sister's big brass bed (she was
born in it).  At first he has no idea where he's at, then
sees Mother Sister sitting down across the room smiling at
him.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Good morning.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Is it a good morning?

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself
		  killed last night.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  I've done that before.

Da Mayor gets up out of her big brass bed.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  Where did you sleep?

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  I didn't.

<b>					DA MAYOR
</b>		  I hope the block is still standing.

<b>					MOTHER SISTER
</b>		  We're still standing.

Da Mayor and Mother Sister both look out the parlor window
to see THE BLOCK and Mookie.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Mookie walks up to Sal's Famous Pizzeria as it still
smoulders in the morning light.  Sal emerges from the
wreckage; he looks like he might have slept there.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Whatdafuck do you want?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I wants my money.  I wants to get

Sal looks at Mookie in disbelief.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Mookie, I always liked you.  Not
		  the smartest kid, but you're honest.
		  Don't make me dislike you.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Sal, I want my money.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Don't even ask about your money.
		  Your money wouldn't even pay for
		  that window you smashed.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem

<b>					SAL
</b>		  You're right, a kid is dead, but
		  Mook, this isn't the time.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now.
		  Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous
		  Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I
		  gotta get paid.

<b>					SAL

		  Ya know da deal.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Do we now?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  I know I wants to get my money.

Sal has had it.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  How much?  How much do I owe you?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  My salary.  Two-fifty.

Sal pulls out a wad and quickly peels off hundred dollar
bills.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  One, two, three, four, five.

Sal throws the "C" notes at Mookie, they hit him in the
chest and fall to the sidewalk.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Are you happy now?  That's five
		  fucking hundred dollars.  You just
		  got paid.  Mookie, you are a rich
		  man, now ya life is set, you'll
		  never have another worry, a care in
		  the world.  Mookie, ya wealthy, a
		  fuckin' Rockefeller.

Mookie is stunned by Sal's outburst.  He picks up the bills.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Ya just got paid, so leave me the
		  fuck alone.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  You only pay me two-fifty a week.
			    (he throws two "C"
			    notes back at him)
		  I owe you fifty bucks.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Keep it.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  You keep it.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Christmas came early.

Both look at the two hundred-dollar bills on the sidewalk
and refuse to pick them up.  It's a stalemate.

<b>											    92.
</b>

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  This is the hottest Christmas I've
		  known.

Mookie counts his money.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  It's supposed to be even hotter
		  today.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  You gonna open up another Sal's
		  Famous Pizzeria?

<b>					SAL
</b>		  No.  What are you gonna do?

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  Make dat money.  Get paid.

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for

		  Gonna take the day off and go to

<b>					MOOKIE

<b>					SAL
</b>		  Mookie?

<b>					MOOKIE

Mookie turns around and goes back.

<b>					MOOKIE
</b><b>		  OK.  OK.
</b>
<b>					SAL
</b>		  Doctor, always try to do the right

<b>					MOOKIE
</b>		  That's it?

<b>											    93.
</b>

<b>					SAL
</b>		  That's it.

Mookie thinks about it, looks at the two "C" notes still
smiling up at him.  He quickly scoops them up.

<b>					MOOKIE

As Mookie turns and walks away, Sal goes back into Sal's
