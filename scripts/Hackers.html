<b>SEATTLE 1988
</b>
<b>EXT. FRONT YARD.  DAY.
</b>
        Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of
        unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class
        residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in
        shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram
        to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed
        Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades
        point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be
        ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An
        attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.

        Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the
        front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.

                    Upstairs.

        Troops pour into the house.

<b>                                WOMAN
</b>                    What's going on? What's the matter?
                    Who are you?

        The troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue
        entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles
        ready.

<b>                                WOMAN
</b>                    Hey!

        Upstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops
        descend on a bedroom.

<b>                                WOMAN
</b>                                (off camera)

<b>                                AGENT

        The battering ram knocks down a bedroom door.

<b>INT. COURTROOM.
</b>
        The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing
        argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.

<b>                                PROSECUTOR
</b>                    The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls
                    himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly
                    committed criminal acts of a malicious
                    nature. This defendant possesses a
                    superior intelligence, which he uses to a
                    destructive and antisocial end. His
                    computer virus crashed one thousand five
                    hundred and seven computer systems,
                    including Wall Street trading systems,
                    single handedly causing a seven point drop
                    in the New York Stock Market.

        As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning
        down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade
        Murphy.

        Fast forward to the sentencing.

<b>                                JUDGE
</b>                    Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family
                    forty-five thousand dollars...

        The court gasps, Dade's father winces

<b>                                JUDGE
</b>                    ...and sentence you to probation, under
                    which you are forbidden to own or operate
                    a computer or touch tone telephone, until
                    the day of your eighteenth birthday.

        Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.

        Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family
        and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and
        photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.

</b>
        Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the
        window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the
        aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a
        direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,
        which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips
        and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The
        title logo.

<b>INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        Segue to Dade Murphy, now 18, wearing mirrorshades indoors
        and at night, working on his new computer. His mother
        calls him.

<b>INT. OTV STUDIOS.
</b>
        In the OTV Studios security department, a phone rings, a
        man answers nervously.

        Dade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry
        of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.
        He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and
        then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback
        System. There is a graphic representation of the
        station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his
        TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh
        type TV show.

                    ...so-called American Indians, Latinos and

</b>                    Yak yak yak. Get a job!

        Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer
        diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm
        selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of
        tapes.  The "America First" tape slides out of the VTR and
        is replaced by an episode of "The Outer Limits" as Dade
        watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.

<b>                                TV
</b>                    You are about to experience the awe and
                    mystery, which reaches from the inner mind,
                    to... The Outer Limits.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Yesssss!

        Suddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous
        message:

<b>                        U HAVE TREAD

<b>                                DADE

        He starts to type ZERO...

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    No, wait.

        Dade types:

<b>                        CRASH OVERRIDE.
</b><b>                        WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

        Dade's screen dissolves into:

<b>                                DADE

        Then the screen changes again:

        "The Outer Limits" suddenly flashes off.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Yeah, okay "Acid Burn", that's enough.

        Dade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The
        tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes
        fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps
        changing.

        The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:

<b>                        I WILL

        More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.
        Another message.

<b>                        I WILL
</b><b>                        SNAP YOUR BACK
</b><b>                        LIKE A TOOTHPICK
</b>
        As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:

<b>                        MESS WITH THE BEST
</b><b>                        DIE LIKE THE REST
</b>
        One last from Acid Burn:

<b>                        YOU ARE
</b><b>                        TERMINATED
</b>
        Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection
        is terminated.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Shit on me!

        Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges
        from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging
        moving boxes) for the fridge.

<b>                                MRS. MURPHY
</b>                    Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?

<b>                                DADE

</b>                    Can this wait until both my eyes are open,
                    please?

        Dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the
        building superintendent.

<b>                                MRS. MURPHY
</b>                    Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll
                    sleep normal hours? He's been playing with
                    his computer all night for a solid week.
                                (pause)
                    Well yes, he could be playing with himself.
                    Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,

<b>                                DADE

                    charming as you yet.

<b>                                MRS. MURPHY

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!

        Dade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks
        his room. Dade is showering.

<b>                                MRS. MURPHY

                    You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
                    Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up
                    again and you won't get into college!

        She pauses and regains some of her cool.

<b>                                MRS. MURPHY
</b>                    I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
                    I didn't want to sell the house but I had to
                    take this new job, you know that. You're
                    going to love New York, it's the city that
                    never sleeps!

<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY.
</b>
        We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun
        shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day
        and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment
        on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.

<b>INT. HIGH SCHOOL.
</b>
        At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,
        head to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up
        to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle
        shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Excuse me.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the
                    principal's office.

<b>                                KID
</b>                    Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

        Now Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the
        office.

<b>INT. OFFICE.
</b>
        Dade is filling out a form.

<b>                                GIRL
</b>                    Do you have your transfer forms?

        Dade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly
        unconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.

<b>                                GIRL
</b>                    It's a relatively straightforward question.

        Dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches
        into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,
        all involving lips and kissing.

<b>                                GIRL
</b>                    Do you speak English?

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Sorry, you wanted...?

<b>                                GIRL
</b>                    I wanted transfer forms.

        He gives them to her.

<b>                                GIRL
</b>                    Thank you.

        She starts leaving. He doesn't.

<b>                                GIRL
</b>                    Are you coming?

        Dade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on
        a brief tour.

<b>INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.

<b>                                GIRL

<b>                                GIRL
</b>                    Kate. Kate Libby.

        They arrive at a classroom.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Here's your class.

<b>                                DADE

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    No, you're not in my class.

        Kate starts away.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Give me time!

        A guy in the halls notices Dade.

<b>                                GUY
</b>                    Hey, you new?

<b>                                GUY

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up
                    on the roof. Take the stairs over there.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Yeah! Sure.

        Kate starts away again.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Thanks!

<b>EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP.
</b>
        Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the
        roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over
        the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.
        One of them notices Dade.

<b>                                GEEK
</b>                    Hey! Hold the door!

        He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.

                                Dade
                                (realizing he's been had)
                    No pool.

        Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with
        his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins
        raining.

<b>INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.
</b>
        Dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates
        leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls
        through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled
        in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Oh my God! He found the pool.

<b>INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB.
</b>
        The kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade
        is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to
        Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing
        skeletons.

<b>                                TEACHER

                    rally. I know some of you kids got computers
                    at home. But these are school property,

                    to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical
                    interface...

        Meanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been
        looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking
        himself into her advanced English class.

<b>EXT. SCHOOL QUAD.
</b>
        It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The
        latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.

<b>                                KID
</b>                    So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,

</b>                    What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!

        The name rings no bells with Dade.

<b>                                PHREAK
</b>                    The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I
                    know you play the game.

        Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up
        to Dade and The Phantom Phreak.

        Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET VILLAGE. NIGHT.

        Dade rolls in on rollerblades.  Street vendors hawk
        computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music
        vendor catches Dade's attention.

        Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be
        equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the
        benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy
        techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with
        psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a
        video game with a huge screen.  Phreak is at a pay phone.

<b>                                OPERATOR

                    Please deposit five dollars for the first
                    minute.

        Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a
        button, and the box emits a series of tones.

<b>                                OPERATOR

        Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video
        game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man.
        She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the
        top-10 list.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    That's a nice score for a girl.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                                (irritated by Dade's presence)
                    Think you can do better?

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    I'll give it a shot.

        Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing.
        Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet
        above.

<b>                                CURTIS
</b>                    Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Sorry, can I get some room here?

<b>                                CURTIS
</b>                    Yeah.

                    Why don't you come up here?

        Kate obliges and joins Curtis.  Dade continues playing.
        He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed
        chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his
        high score is about to come up.

<b>                                CURTIS
</b>                    He's good!

        Dade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak
        is amazed.

<b>                                DADE

                    Well, it looks like I'm on top.

        Kate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows.

<b>EXT. OUTSIDE CYBERDELIA. NIGHT.
</b>
        Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy
        world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a
        little disgusted.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Who's that?

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    And what's he do?

</b>                    That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks
                    slick all day.

        Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.
        Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle
        speeds off into the night.

<b>INT. DADE'S ROOM.
</b>
        The clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade,
        it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the
        school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of
        the school sprinkler system for 9:30am.

<b>INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDIR.
</b>
        Dade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely.
        Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade.

<b>                                PHREAK
</b>                    What's up?

        Dade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more
        seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire
        sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He
        realizes what is happening.

<b>                                PHREAK
</b>                                (amused and highly impressed)
        Oh my God. You...

        A bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the
        hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall
        cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his
        face.

<b>                                PHREAK

                    You saw that?

        Dade nods in the affirmative.

        Kate walks up to Dade, also understanding what has
        happened.

<b>                                KATE

        Kate gives Dade a look that could kill and skulks away.

        Dade walks away under his umbrella, smug and dry.

<b>INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM.

        Dade, Kate, and a couple of other students are writing on
        the chalkboard. Kate finishes first.

        Kate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the
        teacher. Dade is on it. She gives Dade another filthy
        look, both Dade and the teacher just shrug. The teacher
        moves on to Cereal.

<b>INT. DADE'S ROOM. LATER.
</b>
        Dade is lying in bed. A door opens. It's Kate. She opens
        her motorcycle jacket, revealing her bare breasts. Dade
        starts to get up, she pushes him back own on the bed and
        starts kissing him passionately. He responds in kind.
        Then, Gill, Agent Ray and Agent Bob burst into the room,
        handcuff him, break the two up and haul them away as
        Plague looks on smugly.

        Then Dade wakes up in a sweat.  It was only a dream. He
        regains his composure.  The sound of New York City at
        night surrounds him. He goes back to sleep.

<b>INT. KATE'S PLACE.
</b>
        The party. A large, well-furnished apartment in an
        elegant old skyscraper in the fashionable part of town.
        Teenagers dance and writhe to loud, bassy music. Dade and
        Phreak arrive.

</b>                    Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help
                    books for women. Stuff like "Women Who Love
                    Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae"

        Phreak shows Dade the book.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    That explains a lot.

        Kate, the lovely and gracious hostess, mingles and greets
        her many guests, not noticing Dade or Phreak. Cereal
        offers Dade a drink from a plastic bottle. Dade, not
        knowing what he's in for, drinks. Nikon is the Deejay.

                    hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill, and
                    get one back for Joey.

        Dade and Kate shake hands and the challenge begins.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.
</b>
        At a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks
        up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out.
        "Destroy Card" is the final instruction. The other
        hackers look on.

<b>INT. RESTAURANT.
</b>
        A waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine,
        sees the message and returns to the patron's table. It is
        Richard Gill. Right there, the waiter chops the
        MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's
        horror.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.
</b>
        Dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and
        changes an ad.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Alright, he's in the personal ads.
                                (reading Dade's ad)
                    "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking
                    for discreet friend to bring dreams to
                    reality. Leather, lace, and water sports.
                    Transvestites welcome."

<b>INT. GILL'S OFFICE.
</b>
        At his office, Gill is on the speaker phone with someone
        responding to the ad.

<b>                                GILL
</b>                    I... I... I know where you can stick it... I
                    know where you can stick it...

        Gill punches a button on the phone, another caller comes
        on.

        Gill punches another button, another caller comes on.

<b>                                CALLER
</b>                    My heart is steaming for you...

        Gill punches another button. He is becoming quite flustered.

</b>                    ...spank you with my...

</b>                    Aww, Spank your ass...

        He punches another button.

        Another caller comes on, and Gill hangs up the phone,
        disgusted, offended, and distraught. The Plague is there,
        witnessing the whole thing.

        It's Kate's turn. Kate is hacking into the Department of
        Motor Vehicles. She adds 113 traffic violations and DUI
        offender status to Gill's record.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY, BUSY STREET.
</b>
        Gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a NYC police
        grunt.  He is thrown onto the hood of his car and
        handcuffed.

<b>                                GILL
</b>                     Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you
                     know who I am?

<b>EXT. CHINATOWN, PUBLIC PHONE.
</b>
        Dade's turn. He hacks into the Secret Service's personnel
        file, and changes Gill's status to "Deceased."

        Phreak clicks the pool scoreboard so it says 60 - 60.

</b>                    Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and

<b>                                DADE

</b>                    And if I win, so do you.

        Dade thinks about it a second.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Deal.

        Kate gives Dade a look that says "I'm going to hold you to
        that."

<b>INT. KATE'S BED. NIGHT.
</b>
        A shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a
        zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands
        caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body
        belongs to Dade Murphy.

        Kate wakes up gasping.  It was only a dream. She pants
        and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed
        that dream.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Oooohhhh...

<b>INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY.
</b>
                    Kate, at her locker, stops Dade.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.

        She opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and
        bikini bottom.

<b>                                KATE

                    aren't you?

        Dade walks off.

<b>INT. DADE'S PLACE.
</b>
        Dade signs an electronic pad for a package from UPS. He
        takes the package.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Thanks.

        He closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop
        computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very
        high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns
        it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks.

                    cowboys. And all those other people out there

                    help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh,
                    think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"!
                    Tell me where the disk is.

        Plague's face vanishes.

<b>INT. JOEY'S ROOM.
</b>
        Joey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking
        despondent. His mother enters.

<b>                                JOEY'S MOM
</b>                    You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not
                    grounded anymore.

        She kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to
        life, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it
        in the air vent.

<b>EXT. PARK.
</b>
        Joey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives.
        Agents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out.

<b>                                PHREAK

                    asking me about it, alright? Will you take a
                    look for me?

        Joey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,
        and Phreak notices.

<b>                                PHREAK
</b>                    Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.

        Joey sees, and runs for it.

<b>                                JOEY
</b>                    Shit!

        The agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after
        Phreak.

<b>INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.
</b>
        Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a
        condom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it
        there with gum.

<b>INT. PHREAK'S ROOM.
</b>
        Phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking
        career. He knows he's about to be busted.

<b>DREAM SEQUENCE.
</b>
        The Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak. He
        still hasn't destroyed any records, and starts manically
        going through everything. Gill is on his laptop screen.

<b>                                GILL
</b>                    I'm watching you...

<b>INT. PHREAK'S ROOM. MORNING.

        A knock on the door. Phreak awakes. It's his mother.

</b>                    Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano.
                    Time for school, come on.

        The secret service bursts in through the window just as
        Phreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps
        to his feet.

<b>                                AGENT

                    Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

        Phreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping
        Phreak, cursing in Spanish.

<b>INT. POLICE STATION LOCKUP.
</b>
        The undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened
        thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he
        is led to his one phone call.

<b>                                COP
</b>                    You get one call. Uno. Understand?

        The cop locks the dial on the phone.

        Phreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He
        starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a
        ringing tone.

        He hangs up just as the cop returns.

<b>INT. SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.
</b>
        Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the
        boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the
        condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from
        the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.

<b>INT. DADE'S PLACE.

        Kate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in.

<b>                                MRS. MURPHY
</b>                    Hi!
                                (looking Kate over)
                    Well, now I see what all the fuss is about.
                                (she shows them to Dade's room)
                    Dade... you have company.

<b>                                KATE

        Kate starts to leave.

</b>                    Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got
                    a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up
                    call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand
                    free access to data, well, it comes with some
                    responsibility. When I was a child, I spake
                    as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
                    as a child, but when I became a man I put away
                    childish things.
                                (pause)
                    What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse
                    11, no duh. Come on.

<b>                                KATE

                    your help to figure out what's on this disc.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    I can't. Everybody who touches that thing
                    gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested,
                    I'm sorry.

                    something.

        Cereal leaves the room.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    What is it with you? I know we've been
                    playing games, but, we're supposed to be on
                    the same side and we really need your help. I
                    really need your help.

<b>                                DADE

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Well, could you just make a copy of the disc?
                    And just hide it in case we get busted, so we
                    have something to give our lawyers, something
                    that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do
                    that?

        A knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in.

<b>                                MRS. MURPHY
</b>                    Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in
                    the fridge. Cereal has.

        She leaves.

<b>                                KATE

                    Thank you.

</b>                    Okay, thank you.

        Later.  Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's
        records on his screen.

<b>                                PLAGUE
</b>                    The girl. The girl has the disc I need.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    I told you, I don't play well with others.

<b>                                PLAGUE
</b>                    Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a
                    file.

        Dade does.

        An extensive criminal record with a strange woman's
        picture comes up. The strange woman transforms into
        Dade's mother.

<b>                                PLAGUE
</b>                    Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the
                    state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement,
                    two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.
                    When she's arrested, she will not have a
                    trial, she will not pass go, she will go
                    directly to jail. Then I change this file
                    back to the original, and your mom disappears.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    That's bullshit.

<b>                                PLAGUE
</b>                    What can I tell you. Computers never lie,
                    kid. Your mom will be arrested at work,
                    she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip
                    searched.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.

<b>                                PLAGUE
</b>                    Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse
                    things than death and, uh, I can do all of
                    them!

        Dade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked
        mother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over
        her.

<b>EXT. PUBLIC PHONE, WET STREET, NIGHT.
</b>
        Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.

<b>                                PLAGUE
</b>                    Talk to me.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's
                    on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it
                    out. She's not the one who planted the virus.
                    You leave her alone.

<b>                                PLAGUE
</b>                    Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,
                    she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?

        Dade hangs up and waits for some time.  A limousine drives
        by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,
        jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase
        but gives up quickly.

<b>INT. KATE'S ROOM.
</b>
        Dade shows up.  Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the
        disc.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Kate, listen.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    I have to tell you something.

<b>                                CEREAL
</b>                    Looks like a hacker wrote it.

</b>                    Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.

        Nikon points out part of the code.

<b>                                NIKON
</b>                    But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This
                    is taking forever and a day to figure out.
                    I'm gonna make some coffee.

        Dade takes Nikon's place.

<b>                                CEREAL
</b>                    Tag, you're in.

        Hours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the
        garbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about
        anything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of
        half-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    This isn't a virus. It's a worm!

<b>                                NIKON
</b>                    What's this one eat?

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    It nibbles. You see this?

        Dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    This is every financial transaction Ellingson
                    conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to
                    the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    And no one's caught it because the money isn't
                    really gone. It's just data being shifted
                    around.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out
                    with the money and erases its tracks.

<b>                                DADE
</b>                    Joey got cut off before he got to that part.

                    running at, what, twice the speed as when it
                    started.

<b>                                KATE
</b>                    Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...

<b>                                DADE

</b>                    Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the
                    fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and
                    that's us. We've got to get the rest of the
                    file, so we can find out where the money is
                    going before the worm disappears, so we can
                    find out WHO created it.

<b>                                DADE

<b>EXT. OUTSIDE ELLINGSON BUILDING.

        Dade and Kate cut through a chain link fence and jump into
        a dumpster at Ellingson. Kate lands on Dade.

        Kate fishes around in her pants, never breaking eye
        contact with Dade. She pulls out a flashlight. They
        start trashing. They get up to leave and are spotted by a

                    threat to the national security. This

                    Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called
                    Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause
                    Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be
                    blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was
                    really the smokescreen, right. What could be
                    so vitally important to protect that someone
                    would create such a nasty, antisocial, very
