          We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.
          A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at
          first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
          laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a
          hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years
          younger, in hot pursuit.
          Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient
          apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young
          people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.

          Their eyes - Lips - Hands
          Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest.
          She reaches out and strokes his hand.
          He stares at their fingers mingling together.
          The woman sighs.

          with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who
          are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son
          JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in
          his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen.
          The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young,
          early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his
          face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a
          kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER.
          The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is
          in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his
          day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie.
          Natalie smiles back.

          Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy
          climbs inside the cab.
          Frank kneels down to Duncan.

          to their equipment, and so on.
          A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been

          A pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The

          the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear
          - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle -
          the shoes pick up the pace.

          Matt & Frank prepare the rig.
          Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of
          LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a
          collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR
          stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem
          exotic.
          Jason's eyes find the hull of "GIGI" an old Boudreau built
          lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles.

          The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI"
          glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
          Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.
          Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the
          island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap
          onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.

</b>          It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore
          though. It's a city. They have electric
          lights. Artesian wells, even a jail
          lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's
          run by a computer When I lived there,
          had no ferry then` so we didn't even have
          cars, can you believe that?

          "harbor people".
          Jason seems to be digesting this.

          Matt hides a smile about to form.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Yep, Jason - we all are.
          Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and
          doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for.

          back on the throttle s and heads for the winch.
          GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA
          LINE into the WINCH.
          A POT surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge. He
          opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He
          tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER
          and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER
          is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to
          Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot
          surfaces.
          Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN
          BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the
          crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW.
          Jason stares at the disfigured creature.

</b>          .what?

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Well, the trap has nylon nets called
          heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the
          lobster can crawl in. The "Bedroom" head
          inside, holds the bait and keeps it from
          escaping--you know the old saying "two's
          company three-s a crowd"?
          Jason nods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Well{ it's like that. You get more than
          two in a bedroom and chances are
          something like this is going to happen.
          That's why Frank can't leave these traps
          for more than a day.
          Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There
          are black balls on both sides of the tail.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Now the older females like this of gal,
          are the most dan erous - especially when

          lobster you can't sell - and as for this
          fine lady, she gets off easy, the state
          says you have to let her go.
          Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.

          Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough.

          manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in
          their garden. In the middle of this sits a two story cape,

          The sounds of Fenwav park emanate from a chea Dort able
          radio.
          WILLIS GRINNEL, early 50's, a stout, silver-haired man, works
          the grill. Standing next to him is Matt, his best friend for
          forty plus years.
          Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie. Sets it down and searches
          through a plastic bread bag.

          Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction:
          A PRETTY WOMAN IN TIGHT DENIM SHORTS. She-s bent over to wipe

          Matt lies in bed reading. He lowers his book and watches her
          brush her tresses with on y, delicious strokes. She sets down
          her bsh and turns. Matt ooks back to his book.
          She climbs into bed next to him.

          classroom. Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess.
          The girls are in shorts and T-shirts, one with a picture of
          the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther. Bri ht
          bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their nec s:
          This afternoon they were sw' Â°ng. A few look sleepy enough
          to be in bed already. Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping
          time and controlling the dynamics. A single girl sings "The
          Drone"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices.
          They sing the Balkan folk song "Oj Savice."

          that village, the prettiest girl.
          Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their
          ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are
          normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a
          place of pure self. The song ends.

          Matt looks from Ruth, out the bedroom door, and into the
          hallway. He sees Frank rounding the top of the stairs.

          For some reason this strikes both of them as funny and they

          move for an October date - basically to
          save the County the cost of housing and
          feeding him as an inmate - But with bail

          They suddenly become aware of the DOORBELL, ringing, over and
          over.
          They watch each other, both reeling, both out of breath. The

          He closes the door before she can thank hÂ°

          Matt stands over her, unsure of which way to go.
          He stares absently into the small mountain of candy in his
          hands - sets it on the coffee table
          He takes a seat at the other end of the couch.

          He lifts her head onto his lap.
          He reaches out, stroking her head, pulling her matted hair from
          her forehead as she sobs into his lap.

          pick up the old banter as if Matt had onl been away on

          The bet's to Matt. He stares at his cards for a very long
          time. Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm.
          This stops him.
          Matt looks up. He sees the patience they are all exercising
          for his typical indecisiveness. This bothers him.
          He stares back down at his cards. Stalling, waiting for
          someone to bust him.
          He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl. They all sort of smile
          uncomfortably. He can't take it.

          No one wants to make the first move.

</b>          O.K. fine!
          He stares back down at his cards.
          Finally it is Carl who speaks.
          There are things of which I may not speak;
          There are dreams that cannot die;
          There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,
          And bring a pallor into the cheek,
          And a mist before the eye.
          And the words of that fatal song
          come over me like a chill:
          A boy's will is the wind's will,
          And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.
          Matt looks up from his cards into Carl's eyes.
          The two men regard each other.

          The game has ended. Matt says goodnight to Henry and Carl, as
          the two of them pull out of Willis Is driveway. Matt is about to
          leave. Just climbing in the front seat. When Willis puts a hand
          on his shoulder.

          Matt sits alone in the room. Be gets up to examine a picture
          hanging on the opposite wall. He's not particularly
          interested, he's seen it a million times, he's just killing
          time. A corner of the room devoted to Naval memories. A
          pristine version of Matt's U.S.S. CONSTELLATION cap serves as
          the center piece.

          A moment.

<b>          THE SOUND OF A LONE F VOICE - SINGING

</b>
          The voice is joined by another and becomes a duet. We turn to
          find the voices and see we are at the foot of a small knoll.
          A steeple in the distance pokes thorough the last blue husk
          as the sun dies. Looking around we see an ancient gazebo -
          then stairs leading up to a stone library - A boulder at the
          foot of another knoll - above - descending toward us -
          The girls, each holding a single candle,dressed in brightly
          embroidered smocks, enter in procession singing -Jennie Mae
          Mama. "
          The effect is beautiful and feels like a sort of quickening.
          The group proceeds down the hill and blossoms into an -
          AMPHITHEATER which faces the harbor. Ruth stands at the
          bottom of the proscenium - her arms up - directing the choir.
          The place is filled with half the town.

          7.65 automatic directly at Richard's face. His gloved hand poin
          grips the gun tightly.

          Richard.
          Richard gets in the driver's seat. Matt climbs in the back.

          Richard finishes backing up and puts it into drive.

          Matt can see the ocean. He uncocks the revolver.
          Matt cracks the window.
          Matt leans down in his seat. He transfers the gun into his
          left hand, removes the glove from his right, and wipes the
          sweat from his bare palm onto his pantleg. He puts the glove
          back on, gripping the gun.
          Richard's Brown Suburban drives down an alley adjacent to Fun

          Matt presses hard with the muzzle against Richard's head.
          Richard flinches and moves his head forward.
          Matt lowers the gun to his lap.

          The Brown Suburban inches forward toward the garage and
          brakes. The engine shuts off.
          Matt keeps the cocked gun firmly trained on Richard. He gets
          out and shuts the door with his hip.

          Richard looks at the gun, then gets out. He moves across the
          grass.
          Matt closely behind, looking at the row of small backyards on
          either side of them and scattered tall trees.
          He glances from house to house. Looking for signs of one
          insomniac neighbor, some man or woman sitting alone watching
          the all-night channel from Boston. All is quiet.
          They move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door.

          Matt can't help but glance at the sink and stove and
          refrigerator: no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack
          beside it, no grease splashings on the stove, the refrigerator
          clean and white.

          Matt gazes up into the trees overhead, the first light just
          kissing their branches, the sky now a husky blue. The
          surrounding houses with the windows still dark, asleep.
