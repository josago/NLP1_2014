</b>          A man finishes feeding the log into the chipper. He pauses to

          himself. As his turn arrives to punch out he receives a rough
          knock by two guys play-fighting behind him. Walter doesn't
          react, punches out, and exits the door.

          middle of a prefab/pre-furnished kitchen, living room area.

          out of the lot. She gets in her Jeep and leaves, tearing by
          the bus stop.
<b>          
</b>           Walter looks after her then turns his collar up against the
          chill. It is late winter. The trees are bare -- black
          silhouettes against the darkening sky.
<b>

          wind. Filling the kiosk, a clothing advertisement displays a

                         second grade. Her husband was hot
                         for me and, god, he was cute. She
                         was an international flight
                         attendant, so we would get it on
                         for days, while she was off in some
                         country we couldn't pronounce. Then
                         he told her, the shit. It broke up
                         our friendship, broke up their
                         marriage. Later she had a nervous
                         breakdown, quit her job, then moved
                         in with her sister who she
                         despised.

          feet away. The girl pulls out a book and opens it. Walter

                         A cherub of a lad has separated
                         from his friends. Candy quickly
                         makes his move. He pats the cherub
                         on his head, ruffles his hair. With
                         his other hand, he offers the boy a
                         bag of M&Ms. Jumbo size.

                         looks for his friends. But his

                           and says, "If you scream, little
                           girl, I'll kill your mother." And
                           of course little Adele doesn't
                           scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a
                           sound. Then he takes her hand and
                           out they go through the front door.

          car. His hands are cuffed behind him, and he is roughly
          frisked. He tries to look back over his shoulder but his face
          is held down.
<b>          
</b>          E) EXT. PARK - Robin dances in circles in the fields, arms
          stretched out as if she is ready to fly.

          cop car. The cops get in the front seat. Walter looks out the
          window at his house as the car pulls away.
<b>          
</b>          Standing on the front steps, his wife turns away, carrying
          his daughter inside. A cop closes the door behind them.

          into the girl with the red ball and white nightgown. The girl
          spins and spins, her dress fluttering in the wind. Slowly the
          girl fades away so the field is empty, except for a number of
          small birds fluttering around the ground.

</b>          Through the window we see Vicki sit down on the couch, and
          Walter sit on the coffee table, facing her. He starts to talk
          and takes her hand. She pulls it away. He continues to talk
          and takes her hand again, not letting her pull away.

</b>          Vicki drives. Walter stares out the passenger window. The sun
          is low on the horizon. Walter wears a pressed button-down
          shirt. He is clean-shaven and his hair neatly combed. His
          hand fidgets in his lap.

          huge body, a dancing cloud against the sky.

          The ashtray is full. She looks out the window.

</b>           icki's POV: Walter and a woman stand in the distance near
          the water. The woman looks a few years younger than Walter.
          There is space between them. Walter faces her, but she looks
          out at the water. After a long moment, he reaches to touch
          her arm.
<b>          
</b>          The woman pulls away and yells something at him. Walter's
          head drops.
<b>          
</b>           icki lights another cigarette. She flips on the radio to
          country music, blocking out all sound. She looks back out the
          window.
<b>          
</b>          The woman yells angrily then falls quiet -- staring at
          Walter. After a long moment, she turns and walks back up the
          hill to her car where Carlos waits, leaning against the car.
          Annette gets in the car, slamming the door. Carlos pauses,
          looking at Walter, then gets in the car and turns on the
          engine to leave.
