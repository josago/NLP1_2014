          Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly
          nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow
          grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First
          Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down
          17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth
          jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a
          wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early
          childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,
          through an open window to the library, we see her mother
          and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.

          As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound
          of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks
          down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the
          bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds
          Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the

          â€¢ prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get
          the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of
          every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most
          company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam
          Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which
          could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the
          highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches
          Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised
          shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.

          are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed
          up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face
          lights up.

          Mrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street
          into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a
          regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese
          scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two
          Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs
          Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them.
          Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the
          soldiers stands on it. She is appalled.

          at the time, and though I sometimes amuse
          myself with arranging such little elegant
          compliments, I always wish to give them

          takes Mrs Bennet aside to a very discrete conference, out
          of hearing of anyone else.

          Elizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses

          followed her as she had hoped.

          will not be affected by your difficult
          relations with the gentleman we were just
          speaking of.

          away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he
          must go not I.
          Pause.

<b>                         ELIZABETH

          manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

<b>                         WICKHAM

          Lizzie nods.

<b>                         WICKHAM

          She stares at him.

</b>          How so?

<b>                         WICKHAM
</b>          My father managed his estate. We grew up
          together, Darcy and I. His father treated
          me like a second son. Oh he was the
          kindest of men and bequeathed me the best
          living in his gift, for I had my heart
          set on joining the church. But when he
          died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave
          the living to another man.

<b>                         LIZZIE
</b>          Why did he do that?

<b>                         WICKHAM
</b>          Out of jealousy, for his father loved me
          more than he loved him.

<b>                         LIZZIE
</b>          How cruel! Are you sure?

          too lowly to be worth his consideration.

          Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the
          next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr
          Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to
           a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham but
           someone else.
           Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again
           looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see

          Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she
          dances beside Jane.

          silent.

          amaze the whole room, and be handed down
          to posterity with all the eclat of a

          attentions have been too marked to be
          mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the

          matrimony in his parish.

          â€¢ that it is at the urging of my esteemed

          Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am

          with a certain relief, in a charming little parlour that
          faces the front of the house. Charlotte pours out tea.

          Mr Collins, Charlotte and Elizabeth are led up a vast
          stairway which is painted with visions of hell. Elizabeth
          stops in front of a painting of a devil. She stares at

          Lady Catherine is a haughty, bossy woman. Pretty

          Lizzie freezes. When he sees Lizzie he, too, falters, and
          recovers himself. Another man (Fitzwilliam) is with him.

          A stiff bow from Darcy, who looks at Mr Collins as if

          trying to collect himself.

          well.
          Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more

          more at stake.

          next to Darcy. There is a pause.

          think it would be very hard on younger
          sisters, not to have their share of
          amusement because the elder is still
          unmarried. And to be kept back on such a
          motive! It would hardly encourage

          - at Lizzie. She's enjoying herself.

          Darcy flinches at her bad manners. He moves away to the
          piano where Lizzie is playing - not that terribly well,
          it must be said. A moment passes.

          your three younger sisters - even, on

          walks to the mirror and stares at herself. After a moment
          suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at

          which were so disgusting to you, but to
          address the two offenses you have laid
          against me. I had not long been in

</b>          preferred your eldest sister. I observed
          my friend's behaviour attentively and I
          could perceive that his partiality for
          Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever
          witnessed in him.
          Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She
          stares at her own reflection as he speaks.

          and witnessed only the families coarse
          appetite for having their daughters
          married favorably. And so in London,
          perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of
          the unfitness of the match citing your
          sisters coolness towards him.
          We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection.

          better worth their while. Let us hope, in
          fact, that her stay in Brighton will
          teach her her own insignificance. At any
          rate she can hardly grow any worse,
          without authorizing us to lock her up for
          the rest of her life.
          Elizabeth gazes at her father - will nothing touch him?
          He gave up on his daughter long ago. For this, just now,
          she hates him.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          No wonder our family is treated with
          contempt.
          She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks
          puzzled at her outburst.

          constant talk of men and marriages.

          arrogance or stupidity. And if they're
          amiable they're so easily led that they
          have no minds of their own whatsoever.

</b>          I've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy.
          He was always a kind and generous person
          even then. Not everyone can see it,
          because he does not make a meal of it
          like a lot of young men nowadays. But he
          is the most sweet-tempered and kind-

          out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the
          bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond
          is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is
          louder.

</b>
          Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being
          unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth
          recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played
          earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She
          follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets
          â€¢ closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she
          is outside the room where the music is being played.

          better of her and she discretely peeps in.

</b>          Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful
          fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and
          fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After
          sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly
          hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind
          Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.
          Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She
          stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.
          It is Darcy.
          Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him
          there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.
          For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with
          surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,
          Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.

</b>          Miss Bennet!
          Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches
          up with her. They both blush, deeply.

          A footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through
          the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound
          of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played
          at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.
          Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel
          her heart racing.
          The footman opens the double doors to reveal the
          magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the
          dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite
          smile falters. Darcy's sister Georgiana plays the piano.
          She jumps up and hurries over.

          Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful
          to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this?
          She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves
          closer to Darcy.

          Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful
          and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with
          Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit
          comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly
          at two large fish that lie beside him.

          We're looking through a window to the stairwell of a
          seedy looking boarding house. An anonymas pair of mens
          boots appear climbing up the stairs. We move across the
          exterior wall of the building to find an open window
          through which Lydia and Wickham can be seen.
          Lydia and Wickham sit, snuggled close beside the fire in
          their room in a humble lodging house. They're eating a
          meal with relish. Giggling, Lydia feeds him a mouthful.
          A knock at the door. They freeze, like naughty children.

          window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and
          bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley

          world and wholly unallied to his family?

          Allow me to say, the arguments which you
          have supported this extraordinary
          application have been as frivolous as the
          application was ill-judged. You have,
          insulted me in every possible method and

          Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the
          night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement
          of having stood so firmly up for herself.

          is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy.

</b>          Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your
          unexampled generosity to both my sisters.
          I know what kindnesses you have done for
          poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the
          happy resolution for Jane also.

          been so in earnest to keep silent. But
          you must know that your happiness was one

          Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is
          staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's
          cheek.

          Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very,
          very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her
          eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the
          kiss becomes passionate.

<b>                         MR BENNET
</b>          Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I
          thought you hated the man.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          No, Papa.

<b>                         MR BENNET
</b>          He is rich, to be sure, and you will have
          more fine carriages than Jane. But will
          that make you happy?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>
<b>                         (UNCOMFORTABLE)
</b>          Have you no other objection than your
          belief in my indifference?

<b>                         MR BENNET
</b>          None at all. We all know him to be a
          proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but
          this would be nothing if you really liked
          him.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          (tears in her eyes)
          I do like him!

<b>                         (WITH PASSION)
</b>          I love him! He's not proud. It's I who's
          been prejudiced, who didn't realize ...
          You don't know him, Papa...if I told you
          what he's really like. What he's done.

<b>                         MR BENNET
</b>          What has he done?

          Darcy, in an agony, paces up and down the lawn. He looks
          at the library window.

          No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't
          want it.

<b>                         (PAUSE)
</b>          We misjudged him, me more than anyone. In
          every way,not just in this matter. I've
          been so blind. He's been so blind! About
          Jane, about so many things. Then so have

          Mr Bennet gazes at his daughter-. He still can't quite
          take it in.

<b>                         MR BENNET
</b>          You do love him, don't you?
          Elizabeth nods.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          â€¢ Very much.
          He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves
          his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no
          doubt.

<b>                         MR BENNET
</b>          I cannot believe that anyone can deserve
          you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I
          heartily give my consent.
          Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him.

<b>                         MR BENNET
</b>          I could not have parted with you, my
          Lizzie, to any one less worthy.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Oh thank you!
          She starts to rush out.

          We move through a vast wedding party, following Elizabeth
          and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham
          are missing. Let everyone have an end.
          Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off
          into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.
          Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy
          and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades
          as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past
          the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to
          Elizabeth and smiles.

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          Allow me, Mrs Darcy.
          He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the
          rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by
          side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          How did it begin?

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or

<b>                         Â€¢
</b>          the look. It was too long ago and I was
          in the middle before I knew it had begun.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Now be sincere, did you admire me for my
          impertinenc?

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          For the liveliness of your mind, I did.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          You may as well call it impertinence,
          though make a virtue of it by all means.
          My good qualities are under your
          protection, and you are to exaggerate -
          them as much as possible. And, in return,
          it belongs to me to find occasions for
          teasing and quarrelling with you as often
          as maybe... and I shall begin directly...
          We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and
          smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter
          and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...
