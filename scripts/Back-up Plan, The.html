<b>INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
</b>
We're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly
sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a
foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish.

<b>                    ZOE (V.O.)
</b>          I can't believe I didn't get a
          pedicure for this. How
          embarrassing. Look at that...

The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide.

<b>                    ZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
</b>          What's wrong with me? If I were
          with a real guy doing this, I
          would've gotten a pedicure. And a
          wax. I'm pathetic.

The CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped.

<b>                    ZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Fuck, that one's even worse. And
          when did my toes get so fat? No
          wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed
          animal.

Zoe lets out a sigh.    She speaks out-loud now.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.

<b>                       DR. HARRIS
</b>          What?

DR. HARRIS (mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's
knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          My toes...sorry.

<b>                    DR. HARRIS
</b>          I'm not looking at your toes.

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          Right.   Duh.

Dr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves.


<b>                       DR. HARRIS
</b>          All done.
<b>                                                           2.

<b>                       ZOE
</b>          That's it?

And now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper
gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something,
girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend.

<b>                    DR. HARRIS
</b>          I'll elevate your legs for ten
          minutes and then you're good to go.

He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her
legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          This is the first time I've heard
          that ticking clock sound and it
          doesn't freak me out.

<b>                     DR. HARRIS
</b>          Good.   Just relax.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I can't, I'm totally freaking out.

<b>                    DR. HARRIS
</b>          Everything's going to be great. I
          have a feeling you and...
              (checks empty syringe)
          Number CRM-101404 are going to make
          beautiful babies together.

Zoe smiles.   Maybe he's right.   Yeah...of course he's right.

<b>                    BOBBY (V.O.)
</b>          Number CRM-101404? Are you high?

BOBBY, 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file
and points to a piece of paper.

Zoe points to a stack of potential donors.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          You think they're all telling the

          good looking, why are they beating
          off into a cup?

          these bags under my eyes? Ricardo
          slept over last night, and he
          wanted to hold me. I actually had
          to fake a seizure.

Zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands.

Zoe and MONA, Zoe's age but looks much older, sit at the
kitchen table.

<b>                    MONA
</b>          You don't want kids.    Trust me.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Easy for you to say.    You have
          four.

<b>                    MONA
</b>          Yeah, and it's awful.

Three CHILDREN run through the kitchen yelling and screaming.
A beat later, a TODDLER runs after them crying.

<b>                    MONA (CONT'D)
</b>          They've ruined my life.

Zoe shakes her head.

<b>                    MONA (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you want to?

Zoe shakes her head again.

<b>                    MONA (CONT'D)
</b>          I would do that for you. To prove
          to you that you don't want to have
          kids, I will show you my vagina.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I don't want to see your vagina.    I
          want a baby. My own baby.

<b>                    MONA
</b>          Is it possible you're just a little
          lonely? You know, you haven't met
          the right guy and--

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          It's not about a guy. I don't need
          a guy. I don't even think I want a
          guy at this point. I've dated a
          hundred guys in the last five
          years, and not one of them is even
          close to being the one. How long
          am I supposed to wait?

<b>                    MONA

          around the corner.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Well, then he's late. And I hate
          people who are late. And what if
          he's not right around the corner?
          What if he's miles away?

Zoe shakes her head.   She becomes very serious.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          I want to have a baby. And time is
          running out. I hear a clock
          ticking every time I close my eyes.
          I need it to stop.

We hear a loud DING.

Zoe opens her eyes. We're back in the exam room.      She looks
at the timer, which just hit zero. She smiles.

</b>          Ding.

Then a tear forms in the corner of her eye. She wipes it
away. She wipes a tear from the other eye. Happy tears.
Then she looks at her legs high above her on the table.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          How the fuck am I supposed to get
          down from here?


<b>INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER
</b>
Zoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly
together, moving only from the knees down. Dr. Harris
passes.

<b>                    DR. HARRIS
</b>          You don't have to walk like that.

<b>                        ZOE
</b>          Oh.   Okay.

Zoe separates her legs an inch.     And then closes them.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Should we hug? We might have just
          made a baby together.


<b>INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still
pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her
own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this
exclusive baby club.

<b>                        ZOE
</b>          Hi.

<b>                        PREGNANT WOMEN

Zoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a
BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club...

<b>                      WOMAN
</b>          Hi.

The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby
with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time.

<b>                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          You're starting to freak me out.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Sorry.

Zoe looks down.    After a beat, she sneaks another look.

<b>                      WOMAN
</b>          Stop it.


<b>EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY
</b>
It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas
inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over
their heads.

Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her
hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's
spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together.

A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Hi!

Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to
walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She
rounds the corner towards the subway station and then,
miraculously, spies a cab.

<b>                      ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Taxi!

She runs (little steps) across the street.


<b>INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe closes the door behind her.

As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices
someone entering the cab from the other side.

This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --
faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.

<b>                    STAN

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          No, but I'm about to rent it.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Actually, if we're being technical,
          you kind of stole it.

</b>          I don't think so.

<b>                    STAN

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I didn't see you.

The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Maybe you're not from around here,
          but there's a code. It's like war,

<b>                     ZOE

Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)

They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)

Zoe storms off with her little steps.

Stan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time.

They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all
the other NEW YORKERS who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab

They nod and separate.


<b>INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY
</b>
Hudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store
filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits.

Zoe enters. Her dog, NUTS, a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind
legs in a WHEELCHAIR, bounds/wheels towards her, barking.
<b>                                                         11.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Hey, Nutsy. How's it going?

She gives Nuts a good scratch. JALISA, mid-30s, Latina
hottie, and Bobby run from the back.

<b>                    BOBBY
</b>          Oh, my God, you're glowing.

          She's glowing, right?

</b>          Everything.

<b>                    ZOE

<b>                    BOBBY
</b>          You just got shot up with a wad of
          red-headed-freckle sperm. There's
          something to tell.

<b>                    JALISA
</b>          He had red hair and freckles?

<b>                    BOBBY
</b>          I tried to talk her out of it.

<b>                    JALISA

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I lay down, put my feet up, five

          barely felt a thing.

</b>          Sounds like Ricardo.

<b>                    JALISA
</b>          Tell me about it, Papi.

Bobby and Jalisa high five.    Bobby then turns to Zoe.

<b>                    BOBBY
</b>          So...what happens now?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Now, we wait.

<b>                    BOBBY
</b>          That's no fun, I want to know if
          I'm going to be a fairy godmother.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          We'll just have to wait and see.

Zoe smiles and heads for the back.


<b>EXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHT
</b>
The lights in the pet store go dark.   Moments later, Zoe,
Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit.

<b>                    BOBBY
</b>          Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can
          have an O'Dhouls or something.

<b>                    JALISA
</b>          We'll go to the piano bar and get
          Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.

<b>                    BOBBY
</b>          Forget it, she's not coming. I can
          tell by the dull look on her face.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Love you.

They all hug.   Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm,
singing.

<b>                    BOBBY/JALISA
</b>          I saw the sign and it opened up my
          eyes, I saw the sign...

Zoe turns to lock up.   While her back is turned, Stan appears
from the shadows.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Hi.

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          Aahhh!

Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's
reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          You scared the hell out of me!

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Oh, wow.   Is he...okay?

Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.   Zoe sets
him upright.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          What are you doing here?

<b>                    STAN

<b>                     STAN

Zoe allows a small smile.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Can I just give you my card? Here.
          Take my card. I'm not a freak.
          Really. I sell cheese.

This hangs out there for a beat.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Cheese?

<b>                    STAN

          We make cheese. You like cheese?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I guess. I've never really thought
          about it.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us
          at the Farmer's market? Come by
          sometime and you can taste my
          cheese.
              (then)
          Okay, I'm going to go. This has
          not gone as planned.

Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Bye.

Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around.
Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go.

Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is
beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.
Zoe opens her eyes.

After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts
up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out
as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.

<b>INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small,
East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a
child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing.

This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL,
40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.

<b>                    CAROL
</b>          Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.

<b>                       EVERYONE
</b>          Hi, Zoe.

<b>                    CAROL
</b>          Welcome to Single Mother's By
          Choice. As the name suggests, we
          are all single mothers by choice.
          Some of us have adopted, some
          conceived with a donor, every story
          is different, but with the same
          common denominator. We wanted to
          have a child, and we didn't need a
          partner to make it happen.

The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense,
somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut,
turns to Zoe.

<b>                    LORI
</b>          Are you a doer or a tryer?

<b>                       ZOE
</b>          Excuse me?

<b>                    LORI
</b>          Are you already a single mother or

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just
          inseminated a few days ago.
              (then)
          Inseminated...makes me feel like a
          cow or something.

<b>                     CAROL

          to do, right?

          yourself.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet
          store on Hudson Street. Dogs,
          cats, rabbits...no birds, they
          creep me out. Before that, I
          worked for Google, which I
          completely hated. One day, I
          decided life was too short, and,
          against my accountant's advice, I
          quit Google, cashed out and bought
          the pet store. Now I'm really
          happy on the work front, but I
          still haven't found, you know, the
          one.

<b>                     CAROL
</b>          Ah, yes.   The elusive "one."

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I always imagined I'd be married
          with kids by now, but it doesn't
          look like it's going to happen that
          way. So, time for Plan B.

<b>                    CAROL
</b>          Society tells us we're supposed to
          find that special person to make us
          happy and complete. But guess
          what...you have to create your own
          happiness. You don't need someone
          to complete you, some...man. You
          already are complete.

<b>                    LORI
</b>          Amen, sister.

<b>                    CAROL
</b>          If you want to have a baby, we here
          at Single Mothers By Choice can be
          your partners. We will be your
          emotional rocks.

Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the
one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with an
even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl
covered in tatoos. And several more...

<b>                    CAROL (CONT'D)
</b>          From inception to college
          graduation and everything in
          between. We're here for each
          other.

Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.

<b>                    ZOE

Dakota looks up from the breast.

<b>INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY

Zoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of
pastries and a pot of coffee.

<b>                    MONA

<b>                     MONA

Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window.

<b>EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY
</b>
The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the
sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby.

Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.    She
looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Oh, well.

She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on
the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a
few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The
Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp
contrast with the tall buildings all around.

As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band.
He's playing banjo.

Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S
BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.

<b>                    OLIVIA
</b>          Can I help you?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (distracted)
          No, I'm fine.

Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some
blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is
looking at Stan.

<b>                    OLIVIA
</b>          Tasty, huh?

Zoe nods and takes another berry.

<b>                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
</b>          All ripe and juicy. And firm, too.
          Bet you could just eat him up in
          one bite, right?

Zoe now turns, confused.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          What?

<b>                    OLIVIA

Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face-
to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo
slung over his shoulder.

          I was just in the neighborhood. I
          thought I'd come by and get some
          blueberries. I'm going to make a
          pie.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          I love blueberry pie.

Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I'm confused. I thought you made
          cheese or something.

<b>EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER
</b>
Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          This is our basic chevre, probably
          our best seller. The cheese that
          started it all, as they say. Then
          over here we have our surface-
          ripened cheeses. These are the
          aged/raw milk cheeses.
              (realizing)
          This is really boring, huh?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          No, not at all.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          It's like you're in a foreign
          country and the only thing to watch
          on tv is a documentary on cheese.
          You don't want to watch it, but
          somehow you can't stop...

<b>                    ZOE

<b>                    STAN
</b>          All right, you asked for it...
              (boring voice)
          The aged/raw milk cheeses are made
          from raw milk and then aged for
          four to six months. Sometimes
          more. Sometimes less. Usually
          more. Depends on the cheese.

up from behind the counter.

Fred points to Stan.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I should really get back to work.

</b>          Come on, say the word and we can
          have a six-course tasting menu at
          Union Square Cafe. I know the
          chef.

<b>                    ZOE

</b>Stan from the Farmer's Market?
He's called twice already.

</b>Really?

<b>          BOBBY
</b>Is he a farmer? Because that's not
okay.

</b>No.   He makes cheese.

<b>          BOBBY
</b>He's a pilgrim?

<b>           ZOE
</b>I don't know what he is. He's cute

<b>          BOBBY
</b>What about the, you know, bun in
the oven?

<b>          ZOE
</b>I really doubt I'm pregnant.

</b>You want to be pregnant. You don't
want to be pregnant. I'm confused.

<b>           ZOE
</b>I want to be pregnant. Of course I
want to be pregnant. I mean, I put
a lot of thought into this, right?
    (then)
So what did Stan say?

<b>          BOBBY
</b>He says to name any restaurant you
want to go to.

              (then)
          He didn't say the "bells on" part.
          I added that. Sounds a little too
          gay, though, so I take it back.


<b>EXT. 8TH STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Zoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen
her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns
into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date.


<b>INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - NIGHT
</b>
Zoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs
in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically.

<b>                    STAN

</b>          Good, right?

Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big.

They clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a
connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay
together, feeling the charge between them.

She pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real.
She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question.

</b>            Are you feeling okay?

Zoe nods.   Her face looks pale.

<b>                      STAN (CONT'D)
</b>            Good, because this should really
            be a culinary adventure. This is
            an underground restaurant that
            moves from apartment to apartment,
            depending on the chef.

Zoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls
the window all the way down and hangs her head out.

<b>                        STAN (CONT'D)
</b>            And some of the guys from the band
            will be there. So, we might get a
            little jam going. Sounds fun,
            right?
                 (then)
            Zoe?

Zoe's POV. Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the
wind swirls her hair into her face. Brooklyn approaches like
a bad dream.


<b>INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is
making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of
sweat on her forehead.

<b>                      STAN
</b>            And this looks like a mache salad
            with grapes and feta.

He takes some for each of them.

Out the window and across the street, we see a drugstore.

Her cell phone RINGS.    It's Bobby.   She picks it up.

Zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag. The tests spill
out onto the floor. She quickly scoops everything back in.

show PLUS SIGNS and CHECK MARKS and DOUBLE HASH MARKS.

Zoe exits the bathroom with a wide-eyed, terrified look on
her face. By the bar, she sees a PREGNANT WOMAN sipping a
glass of wine. She rushes over.

Outside, we hear a banjo and guitar tuning up.


<b>EXT. BACK PATIO - SAME
</b>
Stan, JERRY and SCOOTER are just starting to play. A small
crowd gathers round. Stan starts to sing an old tune called
"Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes."

while he sings.

Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,
she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.

<b>                       ZOE
</b>          Ohhhhhhhh.

She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that
must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the
answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,
mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her
eyes.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)

But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.

The lobby is well-appointed and cheery. A young STAFF works
behind a front desk area. Were it not for a scattering of
PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS, you might think we were at a Ramada.

Zoe walks by the front desk.   ANNIE, an employee, looks up.

</b>Well, if he's the right one, he'll
stay.

<b>          ZOE
</b>Do you really think so?

<b>          NANA
</b>Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that
would be enough to appease you.

<b>          ZOE
</b>Should I still visit him for the
weekend? Or should I just vanish
and hope he forgets I ever existed.

<b>          NANA
</b>Don't be silly. Go up there for
the weekend. Spend some time with
him and see what he's really like.

<b>           ZOE
</b>Yeah.   You're right.
<b>                                                            41.
</b>

<b>                    NANA
</b>          You might find out he's a total
          douchebag and then the whole thing
          is moot.

Zoe looks at Nana.   Douchebag?


<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Zoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly
and a bit maniacally.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Okay, so we'll just hope that he's
          a douchebag. Could happen, right?

WIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat.      He's yawning.

<b>                       ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm sorry.     Am I keeping you up?

Nuts closes his eyes and lays down.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          My whole life is falling apart and
          you can't keep your bug-eyes open?
              (yawning)
          Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why
          am I so tired? I slept nine hours.
              (thinks, then)
          And I'm starving, too. What the
          hell is going on?

Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.


<b>INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY
</b>
Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station
Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a
smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Am I even allowed to drink coffee?

The trucker looks at her.    She looks at him.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you know anything about being
          pregnant?
<b>                                                          42.
</b>

<b>EXT. CAR - LATER
</b>
Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the
middle of nowhere.


<b>INT. CAR - SAME
</b>
Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A
small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar
wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is
in her lap.

Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third
ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a
few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the
little coffee cup.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Thanks a lot, decaf.

She picks up the phone.

<b>                    STAN (O.S.)
</b>          Where are you?

Zoe looks around.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I have no idea.


<b>EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
</b>
Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson
River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green
pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old
carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top.

Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens
the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          He's so not a douchebag.


<b>INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
They enter the front door.    Zoe takes in the charming
carriage house.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I can't believe you live here.
          This is ridiculous.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          I just come on weekends. My
          parents really live here.

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          Oh.   Where are they now?

<b>                    STAN
</b>          In the kitchen.

Zoe stops short.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Wait, they're here? Now? Is this
          a "meet the parents" kind of thing?
          I wasn't prepared for this.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          No. Not at all.    I mean, you'll
          meet them, but--

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          When you said come up for the
          weekend, I assumed it was just us.
              (then)
          I think I need to lay down.


<b>INT. STAN'S BEDROM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her
chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Are you hung-over or something?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I'm just...not myself. Give me ten
          minutes. A ten-minute power nap
          and I'm good. I need to regroup.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Are you sure you're okay?
              (then)
          Zoe? Hello?

But she's already out.   Stan gives her a little poke.


<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Stan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look
up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in-
law.
<b>                                                           44.
</b>

<b>                     EDWARD
</b>          Oh.   It's just you.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          She's taking a nap.

<b>                     JOAN
</b>          A nap?   Now? She just got here.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Mom, I need you to not be
          judgemental, okay. I like this
          girl a lot.

<b>                    JOAN
</b>          How can I be judgemental?    We
          haven't even met her yet.

We hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall.

<b>                    JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          What the heck is that?

The SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls
into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Oh.   This is Nuts.

Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and
then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look.

<b>                    JOAN
</b>          Who's judging?!


<b>INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
It's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position.
Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          What was that?

We hear the GRUMBLE again.    It's her stomach.   She puts her
hands over it.

<b>                     ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Whoa.

Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag
is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and
then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.
<b>                                                         45.
</b>

<b>INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (whispering)
          Stan?

No one in sight.   She waits a beat and then whispers louder.

<b>                       ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Stan!


<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen.   Nuts is with her.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Stan?    Hello?

Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her
stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something
smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the
pot. It's beef stew.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, my God.

She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon.
She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs
a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew
and devours it.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>              (mouth full)
          Oh, my God.

She replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands
there. And stands there some more.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, who am I kidding?

She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This
time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the
other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite.

<b>                       ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh.   My.    God.

Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of
bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one.
<b>                                                              46.
</b>

Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to
toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop.

And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths
bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows
is she's supposed to be open-minded.

<b>                      JOAN
</b>            Would you like a plate?

Zoe shakes her head no.     Wow.   This is embarrassing.

<b>                        JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>            A napkin?

Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over
her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.

<b>                        JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>            I'm Joan.

Zoe nods.   Still can't swallow the bite.

<b>                      JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>            And you must be Zoe.

Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the
best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent
orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back.


<b>INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
</b>
The dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper
and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite
the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable.

<b>                      EDWARD
</b>            The stew is delicious, honey.

<b>                      STAN
</b>            Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.

<b>                      EDWARD
</b>                (to Zoe)
            Have you ever in your life had stew
            like this? Come on, be honest.

Zoe looks at Joan.      Joan smiles.    It will be their secret.

<b>                        ZOE
</b>            Uh...no.    Never.
<b>                                                       47.
</b>

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
They are having coffee and dessert in the living room.
Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like
she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her.

<b>                      JOAN
</b>            So are all the animals in your pet
            store...differently abled?

<b>                       ZOE
</b>            Oh, you can say paralyzed. He
            doesn't mind.
                (then)
            No, our pets are all in great
            shape. Purebreads mostly, but not
            from puppy mills.

<b>                      JOAN
</b>            Those puppy mills are terrible.    I
            read about them in the paper.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>            Well, that's actually how I ended
            up with Nuts. I bought him from
            this pet store near my house. Six
            months later, I had thousands of
            dollars in vet bills and had to put
            him in a wheelchair.

<b>                      EDWARD
</b>            You should have sued that place.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>            I thought about it, but what was
            that really going to do? They were
            still going to sell inbred dogs.
            So...I took the money I made when I
            left Google and just bought the
            place figuring I would do better.

<b>                      STAN
</b>            You worked for Google?

Zoe nods.

<b>                      STAN (CONT'D)
</b>            How could I not know that?

<b>                      ZOE
</b>            You never asked.
<b>                                                        48.
</b>

<b>                    STAN
</b>          And you made a lot of money and
          then bought a pet store?

Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          I love that.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          It's been fun. Beats brand
          management, that's for sure.

<b>                    JOAN
</b>              (to Edward)
          That sounds like us, honey.

<b>                     EDWARD
</b>          It's true.
              (to Zoe)
          When we bought this farm we just
          wanted to make cheese because we
          couldn't find anything we liked in
          the stores. And now, twenty years
          later, here we are...

<b>                    JOAN
</b>          Sometimes in life you just have to
          take matters into your own hands.
          Make things happen your own way,
          you know?

Zoe forces a smile.   If only they knew.


<b>EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT
</b>
The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan
walk the grounds of the farm.

Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair.
This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          I can't believe that Nuts has an
          off-road wheelchair.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          He's got one for snow, too.      With
          little skis on the bottom.

Stan smiles and shakes his head.

</b>          No, I really think you're amazing.
          I mean, that story you told
          tonight. You just quit your whole
          professional life because of this
          little dog? Started your own

Zoe shrugs.

</b>          You're very...unique.

<b>                    ZOE

Stan takes her in his arms.

goes any further, she has to tell him.

It's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese.
Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.

          age. It'll be ready for market in
          several months.
              (then, excited)
          Want to know what it's called?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Okay.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Zoe.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          You named a piece of cheese after
          me?

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Not just one piece. The whole
          line. This will forever in history
          be known as the Zoe.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Unless, of course, it tastes like
          shit, and then we'll just scrap it.
              (with a wink)
          But that'll never happen.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          How do you know?

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Because it's going to be fantastic.
          Sweet and sassy and very complex.
          Why do you think I'm calling it
          Zoe?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          No one's ever named a piece of
          cheese after me before.

Zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          You're kind of hard to read right
          now. You're either seriously
          flattered or totally repulsed.

Zoe smiles.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          What?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I want to kiss you right now, but
          it really smells like cheese in
          here.


<b>EXT. DAIRY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out.
Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like
crazy.


<b>INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Stan carries Zoe up the stairs. They are tripping and
kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.


<b>INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His
body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there,
looking at him before he jumps on top of her.
<b>                                                          52.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (under her breath)
          You're such a douchebag.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          What?

Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.

<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:

<b>INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER
</b>
They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They
look happy and worn out

Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are
all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.

Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...

<b>                    STAN
</b>          That was amazing. I mean, like,
          totally and exceptionally, over-the-
          top, amazing.

Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          Stan.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          There's something I really have to
          tell you.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          There's something I have to tell
          you, too.

Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Can I go first? `Cause if we're
          going to say the same thing, I want
          to say it first.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          We're not going to say the same

</b>

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Well, let me go, because this is
          really embarrassing, and I just
          have to say it.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Okay.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          I've dated a lot of women. I mean,
          not tons, but a lot. And, the
          thing is, I've never...been in love
          before. I've never even told
          anyone I love them before. Because
          I just never felt it. But from the
          day we met, from the first time our
          backs accidentally touched in the
          subway, I feel this, this...
              (he shakes his head)
          Maybe this is too much to say right
          now, but...I love you, Zoe. I
          really do.

Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares
at him.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          In my mind, you were supposed to
          say, I love you, too.

Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A
beat later, we hear her vomit.


<b>INT. STAN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth.    Stan
enters.

</b>          Zoe?

He looks at her.   Sees the tears in her eyes.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Why are you crying? Everything's
          perfect.

</b>            What?

<b>                      ZOE

</b>            Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't
            happen that fast.

Zoe shakes her head.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>            I just found out.

<b>                      STAN

Zoe nods.

<b>                      STAN (CONT'D)
</b>            I don't understand.

<b>                       ZOE
</b>            I know.   It's hard to explain.

            kind of know him. I just don't
            know his name exactly. It was sort
            of anonymous.

</b>            Anonymous?

<b>                      ZOE
</b>            He's a donor. From a sperm bank.

<b>                      STAN

</b>          I know, this is so fucked up.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          When did all of this happen?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          The day we met. That same day.
          And I didn't tell you because I
          didn't think there was any way I
          could be pregnant.

<b>                       STAN
</b>          But...why?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Because supposedly with frozen
          sperm it takes a few tries and...

<b>                    STAN
</b>          No, why would you do this?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Because I wanted a baby. And I'm
          almost forty, and I never met the
          right guy. I was afraid if I
          waited any longer it would all pass
          me by, and I'd miss my chance.

Stan just looks at her.       Speechless.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          I didn't know you. I would have

<b>                    STAN

          didn't know what to do. I made
          this big decision to do this and
          then I met you--

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Well, what am I supposed to do now?
          This isn't how it was supposed to
          be. This isn't what--

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life
          isn't perfect. It's not all neat
          and tidy like your perfect family
          and your perfect farm and your
          bluegrass band. It's messy. It's
          fucked up. This is real life,
          okay? I'm sorry to break it to
          you.

They both stand there.    After the raised voices, the silence
feels more pronounced.

<b>                       ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm sorry.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Sorry?   What's sorry going to do?

Stan walks out. Zoe stands there.     And stands there.   And
then she starts to cry.


<b>INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
Zoe lies in bed awake.    Nuts is beside her.    They are alone.

<b>EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
</b>
It's daybreak at the farm. FARM HANDS move herds of goats
from one pasture to another.


<b>INT. GUEST ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Stan lies awake in a small guest room.   Joan enters and is
startled to find him in there.

<b>                     JOAN
</b>          Oh, I thought you were in your
          room. Sorry.

          Everything okay?

Stan doesn't answer.   Joan sits on the corner of the bed.

<b>                    JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Well, she seems really terrific.
          Dad and I both think so. She's
          smart and poised and...

Next door, we hear Zoe puking again. Joan stops.   Then,
wanting to seem open-minded, continues.

<b>                    JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          And warm and gracious...

Another very LOUD HURL.

<b>                    JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          And pretty and...

Another HURL.    Joan looks at Stan.

<b>                    JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          What the hell's going on in there?

<b>                    STAN
</b>          She's pregnant.

<b>                    JOAN
</b>          Oh, dear God.

We hear the toilet FLUSH.


<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition.
Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet.

<b>                    ZOE

Neither does Stan, who says nothing.    He runs his foot back
and forth in the gravel.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          I guess I'd given up on meeting
          someone like you, and I did what I

Stan still doesn't say anything.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          But, for what it's worth...I love

She puts the car in gear and pulls out.    Stan watches her go.
His hands in his pockets.


<b>EXT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building.   A
beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms.

<b>                       MONA
</b>          Come here.

Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for
a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three
kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down
the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying.


<b>INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Zoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at
the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her
morning ritual.

She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach.    For
the first time, we actually see a little bump.


<b>INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She
looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a
perfect pedicure.

Dr. Harris comes in with a big smile.

</b>          Well, your hormones aren't helping,
          and going through this without a

Dr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the
device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see.

<b>                    DR. HARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Well, the good news is everything

smiles.

Zoe's mouth falls open.


<b>NT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
We're back at Single Women By Choice. The women are sitting
on the floor. Sara is still nursing Dakota. Zoe has her
head in her hands.

<b>                     CAROL
</b>          Twins!   That's fantastic!

Zoe bursts into tears.

<b>                    LORI
</b>          Why are you crying?   That's so
          lucky.

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          Yup.   That's me.   Lucky, lucky, me.

The women are sensing the sarcasm, but not getting it.

<b>                    CAROL
</b>          Are you okay? Is it a financial
          concern? There are many programs--

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          No. I'm fairly loaded, actually.
          Used to work for Google.
               (blows nose)
          I'm sorry. This is hard for me. I
          don't know if I can talk about it
          yet.

<b>                     CAROL
</b>          Take your time. When you feel like
          sharing, we're here for you. We're
          all sisters here.
               (then, to the group)
          Let's give Zoe some space. When
          she's ready to talk, we're ready to
          listen. Deep, cleansing breaths,
          Zoe.

Carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out.

<b>                    CAROL (CONT'D)
</b>          Now, in the meantime, does anyone
          else have anything they want to
          discuss? Problems? Concerns?

Tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her hand.

<b>                    TABITHA
</b>          I'm having a hard time. Luca keeps
          asking why he doesn't have a daddy,
          and I just don't know what--

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (blurting out)
          There's this guy. His name is
          Stan. And he's fantastic.

<b>                       CAROL
</b>          I knew it!

<b>                    TABITHA
</b>          Uh...wasn't I just speaking?

<b>                    CAROL
</b>          I knew you were with that guy!

<b>                       SARA
</b>          What guy?

<b>                    LORI
</b>          Zoe, this group is called Single
          Mother's By Choice.

</b>          I know.   I'm sorry--

<b>                    TABITHA
</b>          Um, excuse me. What about Luca?
          He's been really, really sad.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (floodgates opening)
          Have you ever met a guy and you get
          butterflies and you think this is
          the kind of man who could take care
          of me forever? The kind of guy who
          makes you re-examine everything?
          Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home
          mom and be barefoot and pregnant.

The women stare blankly at Zoe.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          He actually lives on a farm! Plays
          the banjo! Maybe I could learn to
          sew and take care of the animals.
          Like Laura Ingalls.

Even Dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one.


<b>EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
The women file out. No one dares look at Zoe. It's very
awkward, although Zoe seems unaware. She turns to Carol.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Carol, thank you. This has been
          really helpful. Just getting it

<b>                     CAROL
</b>          I'm going to have to ask you not to
          come back.

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          What?   Why?

<b>                     CAROL
</b>          I don't think we can help you, and,
          quite frankly, you're against
          everything we stand for.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          But, I thought we were all sisters.

<b>                     CAROL
</b>          No.  Not you.
              (then)
          Do you know how long it took me to
          conceive? Five years. I had three
          miscarriages and spent every last
          dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The
          woman with the short hair?

</b>            She   just flew to Memphis to watch
            her   baby being born. Seconds after
            the   birth, the birth mother changed
            her   mind and refused to give it up.

Zoe's face changes.     She starts to get it.

<b>                      CAROL (CONT'D)
</b>            So, as you can see, we are really
            dedicated and choosing to be single
            mothers, and you seem to be in a
            slightly different place. You're
            carrying two healthy babies, and
            you have no idea how lucky you are.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>                (after a beat)
            You're right.

<b>                      CAROL
</b>            I like you, Zoe. We all like you.
            But you kind of need to figure out
            where you are.

Zoe nods.


<b>EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY
</b>
Zoe and Nana are walking the loop around the courtyard. Zoe
looks terrible. Like she hasn't slept in days. They
complete a lap. Arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign.

<b>                      NANA
</b>            That man is obsessed with my ass.

<b>                       ZOE
</b>            I know.   It's kind of upsetting.

<b>                      NANA
</b>            He wants to take me on a cruise so
            that we can finally tie the knot.
            But, I don't know. What's the
            hurry?

<b>                      ZOE

<b>                      NANA
</b>            No reason to rush into anything.

Nana looks over at Zoe.     She sees the bags under her eyes.

</b>          You must really love him, huh?

</b>          Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and
          I'm sure he loves you, too. But,
          you have put him in a really
          awkward position. Having a baby is
          a big adjustment for any couple.
          And you're not married. And he's
          not the father. And you've only
          been together a little while. And
          now you're having twins. And--

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Please stop.

<b>                    NANA
</b>          I'm just saying, if he actually
          wanted to stay with you right now,
          he'd be the greatest man in the
          world, and, quite frankly, I don't
          think any man is that great.

They complete another lap around the courtyard.   Arthur
smiles at them and then "raises the roof."

<b>                    NANA (CONT'D)
</b>          Arthur's just about the best man I
          know, and look at him. He's a
          fucking idiot.


<b>EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
</b>
Stan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has
the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look
older. Thinner.

Joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit.

<b>                    JOAN
</b>          You know, people thought we were
          crazy when we bought this farm.

</b>             All of our friends in New York,

Stan nods.    We get the feeling he's heard this before.

<b>                       JOAN (CONT'D)
</b>             I guess I'm saying that you may
             have envisioned your life going one
             way, but the reality is, it could
             go a totally different direction.
             You just have to be open to it.

Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse.      He
shrugs.

<b>                       STAN
</b>             Having a baby with someone I barely
             know, someone else's baby...it's
             just not how I pictured it.

<b>                       JOAN
</b>             I used to work on Wall Street. Now
             I wear boots covered in goat shit.
             This isn't how I pictured it,
             either. But guess what...I'm
             happy.

She gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away.


<b>INT. STAN'S BEDROM - NIGHT
</b>
Stan lies in bed looking up at the "stars." There's even
less glow now than last time. He sighs and then turns over
to try and sleep.

ANGLE ON Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room.
Stan looks at it and can't help but smile.


<b>INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Zoe and Nuts lie in the bed. They are looking at each other
on the pillow. Zoe scratches behind his ears.

Zoe goes to the mirror and does her usual. The bump is
growing. For the first time, we see a smile.


<b>INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their
usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.

Zoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly.

No one knows what to say.

<b>EXT. HUDSON STREET - DAY

Zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as
far as it will go.

Zoe walks on. She sees her reflection in a store window and
smiles. She looks like an actual pregnant person now. As
she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar
voice.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Hi.

Her P.O.V. Stan appears next to her in the reflection.     For
a brief second, they look like a family.

Zoe turns. They both stop. Unsure of whether to hug or
what. They just stand there.

Zoe nods.   Another silence.

</b>            I miss you.

A group of SCHOOL KIDS, lost in their own conversations, push
up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment. This
separation makes the moment all the more tense.

            much. And I think that it's that a
            lot of people talk about doing
            things, but you actually do them.
            You're really kind of daring. How
            you quit your job and took over a
            pet store all because some asshole
            sold you a lame dog. You came and
            found me at the Farmer's Market

            longer. Well, that's just the same
            kind of thing. It's...brave. And
            I can't love you for being that way

Stan takes her hands.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          It's big. And you're allowed to
          take all of this back when I tell
          you.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          It's not just one baby....I'm
          having twins.

Stan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He
takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he
starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one.

And then, Zoe starts laughing too.   The whole thing is just
so ridiculous.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          This is insane.


<b>INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to
face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the
little bump, new since he's last been with her.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Do you feel any kicking?

<b>                       ZOE
</b>          Sometimes.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          What does it feel like?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Like butterflies.
<b>                                                                 70.

Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her
belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Are you really sure you want to do
          this?

<b>                       STAN
</b>          Yeah.     I'm really sure.

They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes
her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as
she dozes off.


<b>INT. EXAM - ROOM
</b>
CU of a MONITOR where we see two distinct baby shapes
floating head-to-toe.

Dr. Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly. Stan
doesn't say anything. He looks on in total amazement.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Are you okay?

<b>                    STAN

          like real babies.

<b>                    DR. HARRIS
</b>          Would you like to know the sexes?

They look at each other.      Zoe smiles.   Stan shrugs.   Zoe
nods. Stan does, too.

Stan gets tears in his eyes.

</b>          Two girls?

<b>                       ZOE

<b>EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY
</b>
Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW
YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to
meetings, or fighting for cabs.

But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so
often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing.
Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the
street.

<b>                       STAN

<b>INT. UNION SQUARE CAFE - NIGHT

We PAN past several small plates of food on a table.   A chef
tells us what delectable items we are looking at.

<b>                    CHEF
</b>          Here we have a yellowtail sashimi
          with ponzu sauce and pea shoots.
          This is carpaccio with shaved white
          truffles. And, finally, an
          heirloom tomato salad with fresh
          Buratta flown in from Italy this
          morning.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible.

Sam tops off their champagne and exits.   Stan picks up his
fork and starts eating. Zoe does not.

The CASHIER reads back Zoe's order.

Stan stands behind Zoe with an incredulous look on his face.


<b>INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Zoe and Stan lie in bed, each reading a copy of "What to
Expect when You're Expecting."

Zoe has the McNuggets box on her chest. She dips each nugget
in three different sauces and then takes a bite. Stan
watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion.
<b>                                                        73.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          No. I stopped reading when you

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Really?

Zoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another McNugget.
She takes a seductive bite.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Are you coming on to me? It's kind
          of hard to tell right now.

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          Yeah.   I'm coming on to you.

Zoe throws the McNuggets on the floor and climbs on top of
him. She puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss
him voraciously. After a beat, Stan stops.

<b>                     ZOE (CONT'D)

Zoe and Mona are on the elliptical machines. Zoe is going
very fast, while Mona is barely going at all.

<b>                    MONA

Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the
closet.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Everything okay in there?

A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Never mind.

He waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out.

Another dress sails through the air.

</b>          Fuuuuuuck!

<b>                    STAN
</b>          You always look great. I've never
          seen you not look great.

Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black
dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          That's perfect. You look hot.

<b>                      ZOE

Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper
are ten inches apart.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Do you have a shawl or something?

Zoe bursts into tears.


<b>EXT. PERRY STREET - LATER
</b>
A cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the
door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. While
it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          You look smokin'.

</b>          Let's go.     We're super late.

She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight.
Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around,
but again, the dress is too tight.

<b>                       ZOE

          first and then turn around.

Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie
down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh.

<b>                    ZOE

Zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board.

<b>                    ZOE

She sucks in her breath and tries to sit up. As soon as she
bends at the waist, we hear a horrific RIP. She bursts into
tears again.


<b>INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

<b>          STAN
</b>Or like how you're horny all the
time? Is that you? Or is that
pregnant you?

<b>           ZOE
</b>    (lying)
That's me.

<b>          STAN
</b>When all of this is over, who will
you be?

<b>          ZOE
</b>Hopefully, myself again.

<b>          STAN
</b>But...who is that?
<b>                                                           80.

<b>INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
The clock by the bed says 2:30 a.m. Stan is snoring
slightly. Nuts is on the pillow beside him. Zoe's side is
empty.


<b>INT. ZOE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a
box of photographs.

We FOLLOW her back into the bedroom and onto the bed. As
Stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph.

His P.O.V.    It's a picture of a woman's ass.

<b>                       ZOE
</b>             This is my old ass.

Stan blinks a few times.      His eyes adjusting.

<b>                       STAN
</b>             Why do you have a picture of your
             ass?

<b>                       ZOE
</b>             My college boyfriend took it. So,
             I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't
             look exactly like this anymore, but
             it's pretty close. It's held up.

<b>                       STAN
</b>             It's a nice ass.

<b>                       ZOE
</b>             You said you don't know the real
             me, so I thought I'd show you.

She picks up another photograph. This one is of Zoe at
twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and
acne.

<b>                       ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>             This is me in seventh grade.

Stan props himself up in one elbow.

<b>                       STAN
</b>             Wow.

<b>                       ZOE
</b>             I know.
<b>                                                        81.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          You look like Anthony Michael Hall.

<b>                     ZOE
</b>          This period, as horrible as it was,
          made me who I am. I think every
          person should go through a
          hideously ugly phase. It builds
          character.
              (then)
          It also taught me that I should
          never, under any circumstances,
          have short hair and a perm again.

She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and
Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm
around Nana.

<b>                      ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          This   is one of my favorites because
          look   how happy I am. I don't even
          know   what place yellow is, but I'm
          sure   it's not good.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Fifth place.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          But I still look super happy,
          right? That's all because of Nana.
          Whatever I did, she thought it was
          the best.

The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe.
Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in
regular clothes.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          These are my best friends, Bobby
          and Mona. Mona and I met in high
          school and Bobby passed out on my
          couch in college and never left.
          You haven't met them yet because
          they might scare you away.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Why are you dressed like that?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Halloween. We were supposed to be
          a traffic light but Mona bagged out
          at the last minute and so Bobby and
          I just look like idiots. That's
          typical Mona, by the way.

Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman
in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          This is my mom.

Stan takes the picture and studies it.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          You look just like her.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          This is the last picture of her
          that I have. She lived for a few
          more years, but we never took any
          pictures because she didn't want us
          to remember her like that. I was
          eight when she died.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          I...can't imagine.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          She had a great laugh. And really
          soft hands. She used to rub my
          back before I went to sleep.

Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up
next to her clock.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Do you have any pictures of your
          dad?

Zoe doesn't say anything.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm sorry. If you don't want to
          talk about it...

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          My mother was in a coma for two
          years before the end. That's when
          my dad left her.

<b>                      STAN
</b>          Oh.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          So...that's when he died.    To us,
          anyway.

<b>                      STAN
</b>          God, Zoe.    I'm so sorry.
<b>                                                         83.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (after a beat)
          It's okay. It was an important
          lesson. That's when I realized
          that nothing lasts forever.

This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          So, that's my story. That's the
          real me.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Things can last forever, you know.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Not for me they can't.

Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while.
Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room.
Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          That's weird.


<b>INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          I'm confused. Why did you say you
          would come witness this birth in
          the first place?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I don't know. Seemed like a good
          idea at the time. I was trying to
          get back in their good graces. Go
          home. I'll meet you there. I
          don't want them to see you anyway.

<b>                    STAN

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Fine. I'll just pop in, show my

<b>INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks.
Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a brownie.

Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and
rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.

<b>                      CAROL
</b>            Zoe, it's so nice of you to come,
            especially at this crazy hour.

<b>                      LORI
</b>            You're really one of us now.

<b>                      ZOE

            You're so calm.

</b>            Oh, I'm sure.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>            Well, I just wanted to come and say
            a quick hi and good luck.

<b>                      LORI

<b>                      CAROL
</b>            You have to stay. Lori wants us

            I've been wanting to tell you guys
            for a while but, the truth is...

Lori drops her head on Zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant
MOAN. It's long and it's awkward.

<b>                      CAROL
</b>                (whispering)
            She's having a contraction.

Zoe nods.   This is weird.   Lori breathes through it.

<b>                       LORI
</b>            Okay.   What was it you were saying?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Actually, he makes cheese. He
          named a cheese after me. Isn't
          that romantic? Sort of?
              (off their blank stares)
          Well, anyway, I'm not technically a
          single mother by choice anymore.
          So, if you want me to leave right
          now, I totally understand. I'll
          just walk out the door and--

<b>                    LORI
</b>          No, I really want you to stay.

<b>                      ZOE

</b>          Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're

          Bring him to group any time.

<b>                    LORI

Zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse.
After a few moments, it's clear that she cannot.


<b>INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Stan looks up from the Hunan Lotus take-out menu he's been
reading to pass the time.
<b>                                                       86.

</b>          I don't know, Zoe.

<b>                    ZOE

          scared of them. Please?


<b>INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
Zoe and Stan hover over the dessert table. They both eat
brownies and keep their eyes down. Sara is next to them
nursing Dakota.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          This is weird.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Good brownies, though. This one

Carol walks by with a little DRUM, which she bangs
rhythmically.

<b>                    CAROL
</b>          Come on everybody, it's time.

<b>                    ZOE

Zoe grabs another brownie and exits.


<b>INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
In the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is
an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who
is now naked and pushing.

Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand.    Carol
is beside her, playing the drum and chanting.

</b>          I know. It's amazing how the body
          can open up like that.

Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw
up. She stumbles for the door.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I'm just going to get some air.

Lori then GRUNTS through another big contraction.

</b>          Push, Lori. Push.

While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out.    Carol
chases after, still beating the drum.

Carol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single
Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant.

<b>                    CAROL
</b>          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her
legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth.

              (then, back to chanting)
          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag.   Zoe
turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie.

another WAIL.

Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The
midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side.   Lori lets out a
loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN.

<b>                    JESSIE
</b>          We can see the head, Lori.

<b>                    CAROL

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (woozy, afraid)
          I don't think that's the baby's
          hair.

<b>                    LORI
</b>          I want to see the head. Get me a

<b>                    ZOE

Zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room.

<b>INT. LORI'S FOYER - SAME
</b>
Out in the foyer, Stan is paralyzed.   Next to him is Dakota,
who is crying.

Through the hallway mirror, he can see what's going on in the
living room: a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable
swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag.

<b>                    CAROL (O.S.)
</b>          Stan, get the mirror!


<b>INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Stan, walks backwards with his head down, holding a mirror.

<b>                       STAN
</b>          Excuse me.     Hello. I'm Stan.
          Excuse me.     Hi. I'm Stan.

Carol grabs the mirror and holds it under Lori. Lori lifts
her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry.

<b>                    LORI

Stan steals a look, starts to dry heave and rushes to Zoe.

<b>                    STAN

          Let's get the hell out of here.

Suddenly, we hear a huge SCREAM.

Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and
plop into the water.

CU of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the
umbilical cord.

CU of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces.

Zoe's eyes roll back and we:

<b>                                              FADE TO BLACK.
</b>
OVER BLACK we hear silence. Blessed silence. No drums. No
chants. No screams. Nothing. Until, we hear the SPLASH.


<b>INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We are CLOSE on Zoe's face.    She opens her eyes.   Blinks a
few times.

</b>          Are you okay?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I don't know. Why am I wet?

WIDEN to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool.
Her eyes go from side to side. The horror of the situation
becoming clear. A spongy, purple thing floats by.

<b>EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY

14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to
unload their wares.

Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like
soldiers back from battle.

They turn into the Farmer's Market.

ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little
Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.

<b>                    STAN

ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese
stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on
Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.

                 (then, to Stan)
          Wow.

At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It
says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

They pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of
leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and
eyes closed.

</b>
Zoe has her box of photographs.   She pulls out a picture from
the very bottom.

<b>                    NANA (V.O.)
</b>          Because if you don't learn how to

          in the past.

The photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like
her, that it can only be her father.

After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to
the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make
up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother
from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other.

Over this image, we hear a quartet playing WEDDING MUSIC.

<b>INT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
The music takes us into the church and there we find Nana,
lovely in her wedding gown, and Arthur, dashing in his
morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands. Both have
tears in their eyes. Arthur lifts her veil and gives her the
sweetest kiss.

handkerchief back and forth.

Bobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition
of "What a Wonderful World."

Nana and Arthur are alone on the dance floor.   It's their

<b>                       ZOE
</b>          What?

Bobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake
style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk
away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path
and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his
ass triple-time, like Beyonce.

<b>                       BOBBY
</b>          Haaaaaay.

<b>                    ZOE

A crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping,
thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine.

<b>                    BOBBY
</b>          Smack it, Bitch.

Bobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it.

</b>          You know you love it. Uh-huh.
          That's right. Smack it.

The old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new
dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples
smacking each other's asses.

While this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face.

Bobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he
lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he
hits the floor.

<b>                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>          What the hell?

An OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle.

wheel. She leans out and waves.

And then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST
MARRIED...FINALLY! "Ensure" cans tied to strings bump along
behind them.

And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely
for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady
herself.

Fred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs
bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off.

<b>                    FRED
</b>          Whoa. I've had nightmares that
          started like this.
<b>                                                      109.

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Stan!

Stan turns.

<b>                      STAN
</b>          Zoe?

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Stan!

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Are you okay? Don't run!

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I can't help it!

She keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her.
They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Are you all right?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (panting)
          Great. I'm great.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Why are you in a hospital gown?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          I'm in labor.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          What?   What the hell are you doing
          here?

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          It's you.

<b>                      STAN
</b>          What?

<b>                      ZOE
</b>          Nana's my birthing partner, but she
          passed out and needed stitches, and
          Bobby asked me who I most wanted
          with me, and...it's you. It's only
          you.
               (then)
          I don't want to be alone anymore.
          I love you. You don't know how
          much I love you.
<b>                                                          110.
</b>

Stan doesn't know what to say.   He's literally speechless.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          More than anything in the world, I
          love you.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          I've been in love with you since
          the moment you stole my cab.

Zoe bends over, holding her stomach.   A contraction.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab,
          hee-hee, hoo-hoo.

The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again.      Stan
laughs and throws his arms around her.

<b>                      ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Ow.   Ow.   Ow.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just
          love you. I love you so much.
              (then)
          Let's get the hell out of here.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Yeah. I think I really need to go
          to the hospital now.

They kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other.
Stan has tears in his eyes.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          Let's go have our babies.

People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's
Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help
but applaud the big moment.


<b>INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing...

We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling.    She does not
look scared. And she does not look alone.

WIDEN to reveal Stan by her side.
<b>                                                        111.
</b>

And we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr.
Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one
by one.

We FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed
back to Zoe and Stan.

Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other.
They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.


<b>INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's night.   Zoe is asleep.

She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she
is. She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to
her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed.

To the side of the bed are two bassinets.   Each baby sleeping
soundly in a little pink hat.

And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her
forehead.


<b>EXT. 6TH AVENUE - DAY
</b>
Nuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that
says, "I'M A BIG BROTHER."

We TILT up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each
with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it. Both
girls have flaming red hair.

A woman pushing a stroller passes by.   She smiles at Zoe and
Stan. They smile back.

<b>                     WOMAN
</b>          Hi.

<b>INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - DAY
</b>
They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Who knew you were such a romantic.
<b>                                                112.

<b>                     STAN
</b>          Well, it's the anniversary of our
          first date. Where else would I
          take you?
              (then)
          Cheers.

They clink dogs and each take a bite.

<b>                    STAN (CONT'D)
</b>          What a year, huh?

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          Incredible. Wouldn't change a
          thing. Well, except for the part
          where you dumped me.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          And the part where you dumped me.
              (to the babies)
          Girls...Mommy and Daddy were
          stupid.

The babies smile and coo.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>              (baby-talk)
          Yes, we were. Yes, we were.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          The first time we held hands was in
          here. It started out as a high-
          five, but then I strategically
          turned into a hand-hold.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          How do you remember that?

<b>                    STAN
</b>          We both agreed that we were totally
          sick of weddings and hated when
          people wrote their own vows.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          That's right. I remember that.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          So...I hope you won't hold it
          against me.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>          What?
<b>                                                         113.

Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling.    Zoe looks at
them, confused.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          What are you doing here?

And then Bobby comes through the door.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          Bobby?

And then Mona.

<b>                    ZOE (CONT'D)
</b>          What's happening?

And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori
and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest.
And we...

<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:

<b>INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - LATER
</b>
Zoe and Stan, still wearing the Baby Bjorns, stand face to
face in front of the guests and the priest.

<b>                    STAN
</b>          I promise to love you even though
          you still eat chicken McNuggets in
          bed. I promise to name cheeses
          after all of our children no matter
          how embarrassed they are by it. I
          promise to always check out your
          ass when you walk away, and I
          promise to love you more tomorrow
          than I do today, which doesn't even
          seem impossible...

And slowly, the sound of Stan's voice fades out and the sound
of Louis Armstrong's voice fades in...

And we watch Zoe's face as she realizes that there are some
things that really will last forever.
