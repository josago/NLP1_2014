<b>          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY
</b>
          A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.
          Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
          corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.
          Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,
          stands.
          Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
          thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet
          tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.
          With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
          apart with a single cough of a shot.

<b>                         LATER
</b>          Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
          Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars
          of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.

<b>          EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY
</b>
          Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.

<b>          JOE (V.O.)
</b>          Time travel has not yet been
          invented. But twenty five years
          from now it will be. Once the
          technology exists, it will be
          relatively cheap and available to
          the public at large. And so. It
          will be instantly outlawed, used
          only in secret by the largest
          criminal organizations. And then
          only for a very specific purpose.
          Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
          from the flatbed.

<b>          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          It's nearly impossible to dispose
          of a body in the future. I'm told.
          Tagging techniques, whatnot. So
          when these future criminal
          organizations in the future need
          someone gone, they use specialized
          assassins in our present, called
          loopers.

<b>          INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY
</b>
          Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,
          opens it, and dumps him in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          JOE (V.O.)
</b>          And so. Thirty years from now. My
          employers in the future nab the
          target, they zap him back to me,
          their looper. And I do the
          necessaries. So the target has
          vanished from the future, and I've
          just disposed of a body that
          technically does not exist. Clean.
          The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little
          flare of angry red fire.

<b>          EXT. DINER - DAY
</b>
          A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's
          truck in front.

<b>          INT. DINER
</b>
          Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A
          waitress sets down coffee.
          Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.

<b>                         BEATRIX

</b>          How's the French?

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Slow. How's the coffee?

<b>                         BEATRIX
</b>          Burnt.
          Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.

<b>          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY
</b>
          Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized
          city on the horizon.

<b>          INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY
</b>
          Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a
          basket labeled â€œLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESâ€�
          Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
          a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Two, Jedd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>          Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
          A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old
          hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.
          In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.
          The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.
          Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.

<b>                         DALE
</b>          Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Yup.
          Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
          his gun and exits.

<b>                         DALE
</b>          Four, Jedd.

<b>          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
</b>
          High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.
          Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a
          coffee table in place over it.
          Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.

<b>                         LATER
</b>          On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!

<b>          INT. CAR GARAGE - EVENING
</b>
          Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda
          Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.

<b>          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY EVENING
</b>
          Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and
          he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.

<b>          EXT. STREET CORNER - EARLY EVENING
</b>
          A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling
          beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He
          kicks it in frustration.
          A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to
          Joe's.

<b>                         SETH
</b>          Walk around! Around, I'm not
          kidding. Wide around, ya shit.
          The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Seth.

<b>                         SETH
</b>          Hi Joe.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          That's new.
          Seth kicks the bike.

<b>                         SETH
</b>          Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going
          to the Belle?

<b>          EXT. DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS
</b>
          Seth and Joe.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick

<b>                         SETH
</b>          Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,
          they get respect.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          They get respect cause they run the
          town. How much did that thing set
          you back? How much?
          Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.

<b>                         SETH
</b>          I was gonna pull up in it.
          Tonight. Heads or tails, call it
          in the air.
          The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.

          with me instead.
          Joe notices the floating quarter.

<b>                         JOE (CONT'D)
</b>          And don't, if we're going in, don't

<b>                         SETH

<b>                         JOE
</b>          It's tacky, don't do it.
          Seth catches the quarter, sullen.

<b>          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          When the TK mutation started
          appearing in the general populace
          it was on every magazine - â€œNext
          Step in Evolution, what's next.â€�
          Everyone got tested. But turns out
          this was it, and now it's just a
          bunch of assholes thinking they're
          blowing your mind by floating
          quarters.

<b>          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT
</b>
          A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.
          Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,
          big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.
          All trying very hard to be big time.

<b>          JOE (V.O.)
</b>          Big heads. Small potatoes.
          Drives past, revving the engine.

          Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.

<b>          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE
</b>
          A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth
          ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.

<b>          INT. COAT CHECK
</b>
          A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat
          check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and
          stops the two.

<b>                         SETH

          Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.

<b>          INT. BACKSTAGE
</b>
          A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.
          DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.
          Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth
          struggles to keep up.

<b>                         SETH
</b>          So are we - hey -
          Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.

<b>          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE
</b>
          An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet
          curtained doorway leads to back rooms.
          Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,
          SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off
          through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.
          A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.

<b>                         MADAME

          Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them.

<b>                         SETH
</b>          Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what-

          And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.

<b>          INT. STEEP STAIRS
</b>
          A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young
          loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          What?

<b>                         DALE
</b>          Zach. In there right now, with
          Abe.
          Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
          eyes.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          For what?

<b>                         DALE

<b>                         JOE
</b>          No shit?
          The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another
          looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder
          then retracts into the door.
          The loopers watch him in awe.

<b>          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

<b>          JOE (V.O.)

          ever existing.
          A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
          head kneels in front of Zach.
          Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.

<b>          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          So. If they're busted, and if

          and zap him back to us, like any
          other job.
          Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
          several dozen gold bars taped to his back.

<b>          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          through the sack.

<b>          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

</b>
          Lurid and very loud mixture of a dance club and cabaret. One
          by one the LOOPERS emerge from side exits, sneaking in.
          Paupers at the feast.

          Joe and several other Loopers pass around an EYE DROPPER.

          Joe staggers out on the dance floor. Miles high.

</b>
          Joe and the loopers are kicked out by burly GAT MEN, followed
          by Kid Blue, pointing and yelling at them. The loopers laugh
          their asses off.

          Joe's Miata screams through the abandoned city streets,
          racing with several other loopers in trucks and sports cars.

<b>          IN THE CAR

          high. Suddenly one of the Loopers SHOUTS -- Joe slams the

</b>
          Screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished BEGGAR KID.
          Caught in the headlights. Behind him, a miserable vagrant
          village in a field.

<b>          IN THE CAR
</b>          Joe stares at the kid, frozen. A moment. Then spins the
          wheel, peels out. The Loopers hoot and shout. Joe's Miata
          screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village,
          whizzing past open fires and dirty huddled families.
          JOE'S FACE - serene and focused. Going somewhere.

          Joe drops Seth off at his building with its bright red
          garage.

          Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.

          An alarm wakes Joe, red-eyed.

<b>          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - MORNING
</b>
          In his bathrobe, Joe checks his apartment mailbox. A slip of
          folded paper inside, with â€œ14:30â€� handwritten on it.

<b>          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT
</b>
          Dressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase
          and heads out.

<b>          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY
</b>
          Joe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields.

<b>          EXT. CORN FIELD
</b>
          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears before Joe.
          Shoots the man in the chest, without hesitation.

<b>          INT. DINER - DAY

          Joe sits at a booth, the waitress Beatrix brings his coffee.

          JEDD, 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room.
          Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in
          the hall.

<b>          JOE (OVER SPEAKER)
</b>          Two, Jedd.
          Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then
          hands him out a small stack of cash.
          Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number â€˜2'.
          All the other transactions have the number â€˜4'.

          Joe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating
          at another table.

<b>                         DALE
</b>          What's that, fourth loop closed

          Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his
          eyebrows at passing ladies.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Fourth.
          On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can
          dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As
          her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage.

</b>
          Suzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her.

          She leaves him watching her go.
          He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen
          this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.

          Joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance.

          Joe staggers in. Not doing so hot.

          Looks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops
          open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out
          an eye dropper and puts one in each.

<b>          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A harsh POUNDING.
          Joe, flopped on the bed, stirs. Then wakes with a jump,
          shaky on his feet.
          Goes to the door. A screen shows nobody in the hall outside.
          Still punch-drunk, Joe listens. POUND POUND POUND. The
          window. Joe slides it open. Seth tumbles in off the fire
          escape.

          A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it.

          Kid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at their
          base.

<b>          INT. WAITING ROOM
</b>
          Dingy with a few benches. In one wall three steep stairs
          lead to a high door. Kid Blue knocks. Muffled voice from

<b>                         WITHIN:

<b>          ABE (O.S.)
</b>          Two minutes.

<b>                         LATER
</b>          Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid
          stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to
          engage.

<b>                         KID BLUE
</b>          You know why they call that pea
          shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's
          impossible to hit anything farther
          than 15 feet, and impossible to
          miss anything closer. A gun for
          fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat.
          A gat has range. Accuracy.
          His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than
          Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Alright, cut it out Kid. You're
          gonna blow your foot off again.
          The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.

<b>                         KID BLUE
</b>          You're right, it'd be real easy for
          it to accidentally go off.
          He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          C'mon.

<b>                         KID BLUE
</b>          Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper.
          Joe stifles a chuckle.
          In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the
          face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe.
          Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory.
          Lowers his gun.

</b>          What the hell is going on out there-
          The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the
          side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall.
          Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn.
          ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway.

<b>                         KID BLUE
</b>          S'alright, s'alright.
          Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again.
          After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the
          tension breaks.

<b>                         ABE
</b>          Alright. Joe.
          Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.

</b>          You didn't shoot your other foot

          The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid.

          Cluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a
          handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek.

</b>          This man is from the future. He
          was sent back here by the mob, a

          That's low effort even for Abe, so
          to pass the time he recruited some
          real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he
          runs the city. Any other city,

          blunderbuss up to here on you. But
          I remember they brought you in, I

<b>                         ABE
</b>          That's yeah, you had rolled one of
          our fronts, a watch shop. And they
          had you, your arms pinned, this
          kid. Like an animal. But you
          looked at me, your hair stuck to
          half your face so just this one eye
          looking at me. And I thought
          what's this kid lived through, what
          he had taken away from him. What's
          he lost. And I could see, like
          seeing it happen clear as seeing
          it, the bad path in front of you,
          the bad version of your life. Like
          a vision I saw it happen, you
          turning bad. So I cleaned you up
          and put a gun in your hand. I gave
          you something that was yours.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          You know I'm grateful, Abe.
          Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.

<b>                         ABE
</b>          I gave you something that was
          yours. And I remember that kid,
          and I think when you ask yourself
          you ask who would I sacrifice for
          what's mine, I think Seth is deep
          and cozy inside that circle.
          Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.

          coincidence.

          Joe holds Abe's gaze for a moment, then his eyes drop and
          it's over.

<b>                         JOE

          change to the future. What we'll
          do is dangerous in that regard, but
          not as dangerous as killing him,
          and not by twice as having him run
          free.

          At the end of the hall, Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a
          cigarette. Not sexy, just tired. She sees Joe, and is about
          to say no. But she sees Joe's eyes, and doesn't.
          Exhaling a plume of smoke, she withdraws into her doorway.
          Joe follows. Through her smoke.

<b>          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
          Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes
          to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.
          All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,
          knocked out of place.
          He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a
          bright smear of fresh red blood.

<b>          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
</b>
          A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a
          train yard.
          It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence
          bordering the train yard.
          Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and
          wraps first his left hand then his right.
          But stops.
          On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly
          carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.
          Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,
          revealing his clean bare forearm.
          Then his face changes.
          Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
          more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.
          The scars spell out clearly: â€œBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15

<b>                         MINUTESÂ€�
</b>          Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up
          and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.
          He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist
          himself over... and stops again.
          His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just
          gone, its stump worn with age.
          Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.
          A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,
          leading out of town. Behind him, the city.
          Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it
          takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing
          has changed to a ragged whistle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          24.
</b>          He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...
          and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.

<b>          EXT. CITY STREETS
</b>
          The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back
          into town.
          He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his
          thumb.
          He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no
          right hand, just a stump.

<b>                         OLD SETH
</b>          No no no no no!
          A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying
          on the sidewalk.
          He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left
          hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.
          Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the
          street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.
          The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows
          Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.

</b>          Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the
          DRIVER. Jams on the gas.
          Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.
          His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.

<b>          EXT. WIRE STREET
</b>
          The car hits a pole.
          Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing
          a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.
          Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.
          He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.
          Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,
          an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.
          Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one
          arm, slams it.
          Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings
          open.

</b>          With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and
          Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.
          Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.
          Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical
          frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.

<b>          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
          Joe wakes with a start.

<b>          EXT. CORN FIELD
</b>
          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his
          stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling
          before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots
          the man in the chest.
          Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and
          purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.
          Similar.
          He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the
          shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.
          Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.
          Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.

<b>          INT. PLANT - DAY
</b>
          Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and
          vanish in a puff of distant fire.

<b>          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY
</b>
          Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.
          Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.
          But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,
          confused.
          2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the
          man is supposed to appear.
          Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.
          2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.
          But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over
          and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.
          Holy shit.
          Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on
          the trigger.
          Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face
          that stares back at Joe is his own.
          57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.
          And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his
          finger eases on the trigger.
          It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body
          into a spin.
          Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact
          blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn
          jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They
          caught the blast.
          In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab
          one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt
          and the bar back towards Joe.
          Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes
          focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.
          Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun
          aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's
          head, a fist and then

<b>          THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER
</b>          Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,
          still squawking French lessons. Sits up.

          Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no
          truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But
          realizing.

          Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from
          his pocket, chucks it.

<b>          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
          Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.
          Looks up at his lit window. Debating.

<b>          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY
</b>
          Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.
          It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.

<b>          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT
</b>
          Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to
          pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars
          missing. But the apartment seems empty.
          Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a
          wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.
          Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --
          footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just
          as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.

<b>          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM
</b>
          Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of
          gold bars.

<b>          KID BLUE (O.S.)
</b>          That's twenty four there. I'm

<b>          KID BLUE (O.S.)

          Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.

          The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the
          floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In
          the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.
          CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws
          his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.
          SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his
          momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles
          back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.
          Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and
          SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.
          With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's
          fingers.
          A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door
          clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to
          crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,
          panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts
          clear and earnest:

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell
          Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell

          to god I'm going to fix this, I'm
          going to find my loop and I'm gonna
          kill him. Tell Abe-
          CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door
          splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right
          ear explodes.
          More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls
          back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now
          footsteps running down the hall.
          Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across
          the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,
          shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding
          as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.

<b>          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT
</b>
          5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets
          shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe
          barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,
          slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out
          the window and shooting down at him.
          Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -
          three stories at least, falling.
          When he hits the ground the world goes away.

          Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance,
          ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks
          his watch, confused. 2:30 and change.
          This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being
          replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's
          different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.
          And something very different happens:
          Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.
          Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He
          pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe.
          He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket.
          Joe has closed his loop.

          Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a
          moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about
          happening inside.
          Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing
          thrashing and bleeding from his head.

          Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog
          tied. Put a sack over his head.
          Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.
          One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a
          large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.
          Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:
          flashes of his WIFE, screaming.
          Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES
          one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry
          and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.
          Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded
          number on his blood-smeared hand.
          A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The
          machine hums angrily. Ready.

          Flash and crack and he is sent.

          And appears in front of his younger self.
          The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe
          hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.
          Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his
          younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.

          Old Joe drives the truck into the city.

          At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls
          the blunderbuss on the clerk.

          On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,
          watching the window high above. Weighing his options.
          He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.
          Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man
          loading their bars in the back.

          Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement
          between parked cars.
          It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the
          apartment building weighing his options.

          After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the

          Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from
          the alleyway, wiping their hands.

          They enter the building.
          Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the
          sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT
          MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.

          The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.
          Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.
          When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,
          blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat
          Man Driver is torn apart.
          Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the
          bloody mess frantically, finding the GAT.

          Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the
          high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's
          right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.
          He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops
          when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.
          Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire
          escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.
          Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots
          upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.
          Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on
          the hood of a parked car.
          Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.
          Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
          Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat
          out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car
          hood.

          He lifts him in his arms.

</b>
          Joe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on
          the outskirts of town.
          Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight
          bandage on his ear.
          A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link
          fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.
          A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,
          heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.
          Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.
          Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight
          zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards
          the city.

          A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist.
          A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens,
          Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables,
          finds what he's looking for at a desk.
          A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.
          Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and

          Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.
          On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to
          his wrist.
          Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,

          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
          apartment with over-eager purpose.
          Empty. He deflates. Thinks.
          Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.
          A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.
          An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.
          Kid Blue stops scanning, hits â€˜PLAY'. Joe feels around the
          door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.
          Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.
          Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's
          about to step away when his eye catches something.
          He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a
          live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.
          Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.
          On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a
          little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring
          into space.
          Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.
          Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly
          exits.
          Kid Blue stops the screen.
          He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.
          The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled â€œCOFFEE.â€�
          Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.
          It's full of knives.
          Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small
          rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.
          Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces
          together. Lights a cigarette.

          confused now but you're listening.
          I hope the voice of god sounds like
          an old man speaking French. Old
          men speaking French sound like
          primeval trees in a strong wind,
          just irrefutable. Wise, strong,
          gentle, all these things in
          harmony, complimentary. At once.
          Old men speaking French. Young men
          speaking French sound, without
          exception, like weenies. Fact.
          You ever hear a Frenchman under 40
          try to sound threatening? It's
          hilarious. English is a tight t-
          shirt, flatters the young. Rat a
          tat tat. French is a double
          breasted suit. Young man can put
          it on, but it always feels like
          he's putting something on. Some
          things, you just need the years.
          It's my favorite language.

          Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and

          but as they go back they get
          cloudier, until they're totally
          obscured. It's like a fog.
          Because my memories aren't really
          memories, they're one possible
          eventuality now, and they grow
          clearer or cloudier as they become
          more or less likely. But then they
          get to the present moment
          (the left straw)
          And they're instantly clear again.
          Like a wall of fog moving forward
          with the present moment. I can
          remember what you do after you do
          it.
          He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it
          pushes the pepper with it.

          Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time,
          and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest
          sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it,
          he breaks off his gaze.
          The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he
          turns it into anger.

          A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it.
          Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.

<b>                         OLD JOE
</b>          No you don't understand. We don't
          have to give her up. I'm going to
          tell you why I'm here now.
          He puts his hand on the folded papers.

<b>          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm gonna save her.
          A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he
          jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into
          him. Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his
          face into the table.
          When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.
          Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table.

<b>          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
</b>          The Rainmaker is alive right now.
          Living here, somewhere in this

          out of my way and not get caught.
          I know how to fix this, I won't
          stop till I finish it. I'm going

          Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.

          a warm-up.
          Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.
          Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled.
          Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the
          hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters
          to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look
          out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.

          Joe's fearful face says â€˜no.' Old Joe draws his gat.

<b>          OLD JOE (CONT'D)

<b>                         JOE

          A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old
          Joe gets the gat.
          With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there
          are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe
          returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.
          Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.
          Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.
          Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the
          booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have
          their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath
          the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.

<b>                         OLD JOE
</b>          Shit.
          Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind
          Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the
          broken window, jumps...

<b>          EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING

          ...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.

<b>          EXT. FRONT OF DINER

          Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their
          guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,
          followed by Joe.

          corn but not there yet.
          The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after
          him while running but they're too far away (and they're
          running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,
          sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the
          dust.
          When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four
          of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers
          slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.
          It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
          there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize
          that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards
          the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the
          Gat Men fires.

          moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike
          the engine turns over with a ROAR.
          The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the
          open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The
          bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.
          Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running
          back to the Gat Men.

          Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He
          BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful
          stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out
          of sight.
          Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn
          paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe
          scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.
          Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and
          scattered farm houses.

          A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts
          the dead stump of an old tree.
          A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the
          trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.
          Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near
          distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.
          Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.

          Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a

          fields, spraying something chemical.

          She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible
          cigarette.
          Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it
          has been here for awhile.
          The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.
          Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going
          anywhere.

<b>          INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

          Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,
          puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.

          Then freezes.

          fields. Watching her.
          She watches right back for a long moment.
          Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no
          hesitation at all plows outside.
          The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.

<b>          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,
          shotgun extended. Not fucking around.
          Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
          fields, where she plants herself and shouts:

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Listen up fucker. I have shot and
          buried three vagrants in the past

          care what hobo sob story you've

          angry at our lot in this world and

          and move on, but if you show your
          face again I will cut you the fuck
          in half.
          Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara
          turns, walks briskly back.
          Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He
          takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.

          afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.
          Put your gat on the table.
          Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he
          doesn't take his hand off it.

          Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance
          door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards
          the street.
          But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The
          Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.

          He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,

          ceremony.
          BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES
          into the wall. He drops like a doll.
          Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg
          hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.
          In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps

          Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps
          off. In its absence the darkness swarms.
          She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.
          Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.
          And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.

          Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.
          In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah
          backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man

          From a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the
          WINDOW. A child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through

          MAN, advancing towards her menacingly.
          At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the
          light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised
          at the Dark Man.
          And the Dark Man STOPS.

          Joe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the
          man's face: it is not Old Joe.
          It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A
          greasy sign around his neck: â€œPLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD

          Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling

          Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face.
          She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined,
          swollen under the lids.

          She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in

          sweating.

          Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine
          leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Thirsty. Thirsty.
          Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him
          through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the
          porch, 6 years old, named CID.
          Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he
          kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a
          straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup
          with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.

<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
          A darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant. A
          small STAKE BED TRUCK rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder.
          Sara at the wheel. Sits a second. Then climbs out.
          Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed. He lands in the dirt.
          Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed.
          Joe weakly grabs her ankle. She pries his hand off, and
          discovers CID'S CUP in the dirt beside him. Takes it
          angrily, strides back to the truck.

<b>          INT. STAKE BED TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          Sara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her. Looks

          at Cid's cup. For a long moment.

          Dawn breaks. Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets
          with flashlights, stopping every passerby.
          On the outskirts of the city. Vagrant fires burn distant
          orange. A large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek.

          A fist comes straight at us. SMACK!
          We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy.
          A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before.
          Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing
          hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar
          fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the
          first time. In her green dress. Whisps of fog drift into
          frame.

          A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and
          off down the street.
          Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it,
          this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm.
          Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the

          afraid of.

          couldn't let me die, you won't kill

          He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over
          to her.

          with me. Does that well have
          water? I'll fill it from there.
          Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote
          on the back. 07153902935.
          And everything changes.

          She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number
          is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.

          For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her
          eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than
          she was ten seconds ago.
          Joe scoots back

          Who are you and what are you here
          for? Who are you?
          Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his

          Turns. Sees Old Joe, standing now.
          Stillness between them. OLD JOE'S FACE. Struggling to be

          Old Joe spins, his breath up into his head.
          The map falls to the ground. The park around him, green and
          full of children.
          He keels over onto his knees and cries. Grabs the grass,
          holds it in his fingers, thick and green.

          â€œGod you have to be kidding me.â€�
          Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the

          touches his hand.

<b>          INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - EVENING
</b>
          Old Joe's little hide-out. He violently washes his hands in
          a trench of water.
          Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face.
          Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above.
          Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water.
          His eyes close. His breathing shallows.
          In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other
          on the gat. The map beneath it.
          Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining.
          And the missing corner, edge torn.
          CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep.
          Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on
          his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror

          but it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the
          steps, gun in hand.
          Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his
          finger to his lips. Shhh.

</b>
          Dark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it:
          an arrangement of toys.
          With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a
          flashlight and sets it on the table.
          Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out
          wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid.

<b>                         CID

          Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.

          He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and
          an identical one next to Joe lights up.
          The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.

<b>                         CID (CONT'D)
</b>          But I need to make it stronger.

          Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he
          goes back to fitting the backing on a toy.
          A long beat, Joe thinking.
          Broken by a PIERCING NOISE.
          They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is
          shrieking, sirens blaring.
          Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off,
          they both freeze.
          And look up at the ceiling.
          Silence in the house.
          With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck
          from Joe and finishes up his work.

          Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up

          Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished
          highrise, looks down on the activity in the streets.
          Spread on the floor are maps with notes. He's been searching
          for Old Joe.
          And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs.

          He sees: Across from the park, a cheap APARTMENT BUILDING.
          He checks his map - the 2nd circled address. Kid number two.
          He waits.

          diminished but still formidable. Joe approaches.

          She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette.

<b>          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING
</b>
          A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally
          with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.
          Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the
          address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.
          Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just
          at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.
          Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.
          The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping
          exhausted, up the stairs.
          And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.
          It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,
          pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.
          He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the
          apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.
          Towards apartment 205.
          Jesus it can't be.
          Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,
          relieved.
          She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely
          indistinct conversation between her and the girl that
          answers.

<b>                         SUZIE

          here, lookin for god knows...
          Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a
          sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the
          neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.

          He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.
          Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.
          On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.
          Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long
          red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife.

          in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe

          in the kitchen, listening.

          Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell
          if they're coming through the living room or hall. He
          hesitates.

          Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as
          they enter from the living room.
          Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours
          him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.

          This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,
          of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.
          Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with

          not sure.

          Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees

          creeps down the stairs.
          He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't

          Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.

          Sara stays silent. A long beat.
          Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.
          She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket
          and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's

          When he looked at me then, on the

          On the screen - Kid Blue rips the sack off and holds Old
          Joe's bloodied face up to the camera.

          The door buzzes open. Kid pushes Old Joe through the long
          entrance hallway, past a dozen Gat Men, who watch him with
          shocked amazement.
          Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the
          tiny coat check room, and Big Craig stops him, then sees Old
          Joe.

          farm on the east side. That's why
          all the Gats are here, the whole
          crew's arming up to make a sweep.

          huh? I'm taking him up to
          This happens very fast:
          Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back
          into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall.
          Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts
          one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the
          Kid's midsection.
          He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in
          the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway
          while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic
          rifle.
          He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but
          mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky
          still for a moment.

          jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper
          into the club.
          A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.
          He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
          and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards
          the club.

          Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking
          grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle
          into the smoky aftermath.
          And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being
          gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.
          The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.
          Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing
          everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.
          It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way
          people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper.

</b>
          Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the
          office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find
          the door to Abe's inner den.

<b>          INT. ABE'S DEN
</b>
          Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table.

          Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door

          Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun.

          Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the
          middle of the highway.
          Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his
          Blunderbuss.

          Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.
          Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his
          chest is grazed.
          The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.

          Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue
          stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.
          Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.

<b>          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING

          Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara
          loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat.

<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY
</b>
          Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He
          tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored
          truck.
          Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
          gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.
          The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He
          throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between
          them.

<b>                         OLD JOE
</b>          Bon jour. You take this truck, you

          your life. No one's coming after

          how you fix it.

<b>                         OLD JOE
</b>          That's how. You got your life

          about what that's worth to you.

<b>          106.
</b>          Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot
          scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.
          Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.

<b>                         OLD JOE
</b>          Stupid little shit! You let him

<b>                         JOE
</b>          I haven't seen that yet.
          Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's
          chest and knock him back.
          Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has
          until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.
          Kid Blue.
          The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to
          the dusty pavement.
          The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its
          wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a
          stop and spin it around.
          Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.
          Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as
          a rock.
          Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires
          scattershot.
          Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.
          Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round
          after fiery round.
          Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.
          KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud
          of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to
          slow the bike but can't in time.
          In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.
          He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
          FIRES his buss.
          A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without
          a driver. It skids, crashes.
          When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.

          At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them,
          is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand.
          Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.

          Cid nears the corn fields, running. Seconds from safety.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA
</b>
          Old Joe. Gun raised. Pocket watch wrapped around it. His
          wife's picture in it. Clear as day.
          No time to move around Sara. Now or never.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE
</b>
          Joe running, useless gun in hand.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          No!

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA
</b>
          Sara, not going anywhere.

<b>                         OLD JOE
</b>          I'm sorry
          He pulls the trigger.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE
</b>
          Joe running. Time slows. Watching:

<b>          EXT. FIELD - OLD JOE & SARA
</b>
          Everything is a little surreal. Dream-like. Slow.
          Old Joe shoots Sara.
          We hear no gunshot. Just the wind in the corn, and young
          Joe's breathing. She falls, giving him a clear shot at Cid.

<b>                         JOE WATCHING:
</b>
<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID
</b>
          Just as Old Joe gets him in his sights, Cid breaches the corn
          fields and is gone, vanishing in the stalks.
          Old Joe lowers his gun, stunned but still frantic. He
          stumbles towards the corn, still far off, his face breaking.
          Trips, falls in the mud. Corn field vast in front of him.
          Cid is gone. He lost him. He holds his pocket watch. Sobs.
          Lost.

          On the horizon, a train.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE
</b>

<b>                         JOE WATCHING:
</b>
<b>          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR
</b>
          Cid sits in a darkened car, holding a bloody rag to his jaw.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE
</b>
          Joe watching, seeing:

<b>          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR
</b>
          Cid's face. Bloody. Dirty. His eyes full of hate. The
          train rumbles towards the dark city.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE
</b>
          Joe watches. Sees, in his mind's eye, all of this.
          And through all of this we have only heard the wind. And Joe
          breathing.
          Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop. A moment of decision.
          Joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and FIRES.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA
</b>
          Revealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still
          in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara.
          But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant
          shot is heard.
          And Old Joe DISAPPEARS.
          Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she
          doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells

<b>                         SARA
</b>
<b>          CID!
</b>
<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID
</b>
          Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field.
          There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is
          gone. The field is empty.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - SEEN FROM JOE'S POV
</b>
          We don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his
          mom, into her arms. Sara lifts him, holds him.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA
</b>
          She carries him. Walking fast back towards a far distant
          figure lying still on the edge of the field. Joe.
          Then a faint buzz. The flasher, in her pocket. She pulls it
          out. Two flashes.
          She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes.

<b>                         CID
</b>          Where's Joe?

<b>                         SARA
</b>          He had to go away, baby.

<b>                         CID
</b>          He took the bad man with him?
          She kisses him.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - FROM JOE'S POV
</b>
          In the distance, Sara turns away and carries Cid back towards
          the farmhouse.

<b>          INT. CID'S BATHROOM
</b>
          Sara bathes Cid, dresses the wound on his jaw.

<b>          INT. CID'S BEDROOM
</b>
          She tucks Cid in, holds him close. Kisses his forehead.

<b>          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
          Sara emerges from the ruined front door, crosses the porch.

<b>          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN
</b>
          Sara crosses the lawn, and walks across the field.

<b>          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS
</b>
          Joe's body. Sara goes to him, slowly. She kneels beside him.
          His pocket watch in the dirt. Open. No photo inside.
          Ticking away. Around and around.
          She closes it.Touches his hair. The wind through the corn.
          After a long while, the sun breaks through the clouds.
