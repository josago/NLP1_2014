    Heavy leaden skies over the arachnoid stands and floodlights

    Flashlights pop as DON REVIE, (late 40's), the most
    successful manager in English football, walks out in front of
    a pack of newspaper and TV REPORTERS. He is flanked by the
    Chairman of Leeds United, (MANNY CUSSINS, 60's), and several
    other white-haired blazer-wearing members of the Board.

<b>                        REVIE
</b>           I'm just going to make a brief
           statement.

    CAPTION: "JULY 4th, 1974"

    REVIE stands under a large trophy cabinet, filled with the
    silverware he has won. REPORTERS wait: intimidated. Cowed.

                        REVIE (cont'd)
           Yesterday afternoon at 3.00, I
           accepted the FA's offer to become the
           next manager of the England national
           football team.

    A gasp among the JOURNALISTS. A burst of flashlights. The
    BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence. Bereaved
    fathers losing their favourite son.

                        REVIE (cont'd)
           Obviously that involves me leaving
           Leeds United after 13 happy and
           successful years, which makes me very
           sad. I'd like to think I have built
           the club into a family and there must
           be sadness when anybody leaves a
           family. However, when one man goes,
           another steps into his place. I know
           who I think that person should be, the
           man to replace me, and I shall make my
           feelings clear to the directors. Thank
           you. No further comments.

    REVIE turns and walks out, a volley of REPORTERS shouting
    questions...

    Two young BOYS, (12, 9) stare out of car windows. Raindrops
    on the panes of glass. Their father, BRIAN CLOUGH, (39),
    slick, modern, cocky, handsome. About as big a contrast to
    DON REVIE as it's possible to find, is up front. Driving..

                  (singing)
           "Let me see what spring is like..."

    The car turns a bend, and suddenly the floodlights and stands
    of a football stadium come into view. The BOYS' eyes widen.

<b>                        BOY 1
</b>           There it is! Dad! There it is!
    The BOYS smile in excitement.

<b>                        CLOUGH
</b>                  (singing)
           "..on Jupiter and Mars.."

    `LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB' written on the side of the
    stadium. CLOUGH smiles, then puts his foot down. The car
    accelerates past the turning. The BOYS' smiles fade.

<b>                        BOY 1
</b>           Where are you going? Dad? You've
           missed it.

</b>             Today we welcome Brian Clough as he
             starts his new job as manager of Leeds
             United, taking over from Don Revie -
             the most successful manager in the

             won everything..
<b>                          CLOUGH

<b>                          MITCHELL
</b>             ...but pretty much everything else.
             Daunted?

<b>                          CLOUGH
</b>             Daunted? Not at all, Austin. Looking
             forward to it.

<b>                          MITCHELL
</b>             The biggest challenge of your life,
             and you'll be without Peter Taylor,
             for the first time. Your lifelong
             professional colleague.

<b>                          CLOUGH
</b>             Yes, Pete's at Brighton now. He had
             the opportunity to come with me, but
             Brighton was his choice. Leeds was
             mine.

<b>                          MITCHELL
</b>             A surprising choice, some might say.
             Because you've been very vocal in your
             criticism of them over the years.

<b>                           CLOUGH

              You called Norman Hunter, Norman

<b>                           MITCHELL
</b>              I'm curious. Why do you now show such
              alacrity to joining them after such
              vituperative criticism of them for so
              long?

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              Football is a beautiful game, Austin.
              It needs to be played beautifully. I
              think Leeds have sold themselves
              short...

</b>              ..they've been champions but they've
              not been good champions in the sense
              of wearing the crown well. They've not
              been loved. But then that's hardly
              surprising, given the type of
              operation there's been in place there.

     He places the bottles on his desk. Then puts two cut crystal

     A flicker of jealousy on PETER TAYLOR's face, almost like a

     greet the arriving team.

     He turns the corner to see the LEEDS COACH a hundred yards
     down the street, the PLAYERS getting off the coach and
     walking towards him..

     TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat".

     CLOUGH cranes his neck. Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set.
     Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his
     coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His
     assassins. His "Goodfellas". His right and left hand.

     CLOUGH walks towards him. Hand outstretched..

     But REVIE walks past without shaking hands, without talking,
     without even breaking stride..

     ..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with
     Les Cocker and Syd Owen.

     CLOUGH stares. Hand still outstretched. He looks over at
     PETER TAYLOR, who can't help smiling, `Forget it'.

     TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON walk off, but CLOUGH still stares at
     REVIE in disbelief.

     "Beeeep", the REF's whistle blows. A Derby PLAYER rolls in
     agony, cries out, a terrible, cynical challenge. Horrified,

     quietly applauding the Leeds PLAYER. Encouraging more of the
     same. As the Derby PLAYER is stretchered off..

     Presently, RRROOOOAAAARRRRR goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and
     his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0.

     TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON immediately start shouting out
     encouragement to the Derby PLAYERS, new instructions, as the
     game restarts..

                          TAYLOR (cont'd)

     dugout.

     Suddenly:

     "Beeep!", whistle! Penatly Leeds! CLOUGH leaps off the bench
     in outrage. Screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..

     REVIE shaking hands with his COLLEAGUES. Smiling amongst
     themselves. Congratulating themselves. Celebrating.

     The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by,
     "Beeeeeep", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in
     disbelief. Robbed. Deflated.

     The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game.

     CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking
     PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, (assuming TAYLOR's the
     manager), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds
     already on their next game...

             it, or what he did or didn't bloody do

             Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean,
             and sensible. No fifty-fifty's.
     CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short..

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Right, I'll play myself. You might
             learn something, Irishman. Two hundred
             and fifty-one goals in two hundred and
             seventy-four starts.

     CLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it
     up onto this head - down onto his chest, then "WHAM" volleys
     it into a distant goal..

     The game starts. CLOUGH, leading by example, anxious to prove
     himself, is soon darting about, calling out...

                    (clapping hands)
             Here, son. To feet. Keep it simple.
             Think and give. On the deck. Nice and
             crisp. Yes, to me, Sniffer. To me.

     CLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another
     player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out..

     "CRUNCH", a bone-shaking tackle from "BITES YER LEGS".

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!!

     CLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON
     runs up to NORMAN HUNTER..

</b>             Fucking matter with you? He said no
             fifty-fifty's.

     HUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is
     immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS.
     Crowding the referee. Intimidating him.

<b>                          HUNTER
</b>             What are you going to do about it?
             Book me?

     JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on
     the floor. In agony. Holding his knee.

     CLOUGH listens to the PLAYERS laughing at him. Disrespecting
     him. His face darkens.

     The sound of coarse, cruel laughter among the LEEDS PLAYERS.

     SAM LONGSON, BRIAN CLOUGH, PETER TAYLOR and DAVE MACKAY are
     all celebrating with all their families.

     The trophy is centre-stage. CLOUGH sings a Sinatra classic..

<b>                           CLOUGH
</b>              "Love and marriage, love and marriage,
              it's an institute you can't
              disparage.."

     To everyone's amusement: CLOUGH sings to PETER TAYLOR, not
     his own wife..

                           CLOUGH (cont'd)
              "Try, try, try to separate them, it's
              an illusion. Try, try, try and you
              will only come to this conclusion.."

     In another corner: MACKAY is amiably ribbing LONGSON..
<b>                           MACKAY
</b>              ..."the man's crocked", "older than
              time" "broken more bones than Evel
              Knievel?"

<b>                           LONGSON
</b>              All right, I admit it, I was wrong.

     LONGSON starts eating his trademark felt hat. Much cheering
     as he munches in disgust and swallows with difficulty.

     Suddenly, DAVE MACKAY looks up, sees the television. Calls
     for quiet!!

     ON TV: a live awards presentation. From London. DON REVIE is
     being presented with an award...

<b>                           REVIE
</b>              ..for Leeds to win the First Division
              title, and for me to be named as
              English Manager of the year...feels
              like a dream come true...

     CLOUGH watches. His expression changes. His eyes burn into
     REVIE's.

<b>                           CLOUGH
</b>              You enjoy it, Don. Go home, put your
              feet up and fucking enjoy it. There's
              a good lad. Because we'll be in the
              First Division next season. And we're
              going to have you!

     Loud CHEERS from LONGSON, TAYLOR, MACKAY and CLOUGH. OVER
     THIS: we fade in the sound of roaring...

     Presently the building reverberates with a large...

     A goal. But scored by whom? Derby or Leeds?

     CLOUGH looks up at the clock. The clock on the wall shows

            You ever see eighty five or perhaps                            
            ninety percent of chairmen talking -                           
            I'd love a few chairmen on your                                
            programme occasionally - I believe the                         
            very sight of them brings the game                             
            into disrepute (some clap in the                               
            audience). And every time they open                            
            their mouths it kills it. Because the                          
            very thing they've given me a lot of

            talking too much and going on

            very people who can put two words                              
            together and its rather embarrassing                           
            to me that a man - or men - can stop                           
            me talking to people like you. I love                          
            football. It's deep, it goes right                             
            down through. It's in every nerve,                             
            vein, you name it. It consumes me. And                         
            when I have to come and talk about I                           
            like the passions of football to come

              thing about how QPR will play. Mr
              Revie would have files and dossiers
              prepared. Had the reserves playing the
              Rangers way all week. Had the first
              team looking out for this and that.

</b>              Bollocks to Mr. Revie! You're
              professional footballers. Stop Stan
              Bowles! That's all you need to know
              about QPR. And I don't have to justify
              myself to you. Not how or when I
              conduct training. Not who I buy or
              pick to play.

               Effectively we were playing the

               And he suddenly feels very, very
               lonely because there's no one else to
               talk to. Nobody else but him.
      CLOUGH's SON falls asleep. CLOUGH doesn't notice..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               So he decides that he's had enough,
               that he can't bear being this lonely,
               and so he climbs up to the top of the
               one building still standing. The Post
               Office Tower. And then he jumps off.
               And he's falling down, down and down
               and down, the sixteenth floor, the
               fifteenth floor, the fourteenth, and
               that's when he hears the phone
               ringing...
      CLOUGH looks down. And gets two unexpected shocks.

      The first is that his SON is already asleep. The second is,
      there is a tear running down his own cheek.

             defence, there are a couple of things
             I'd like to say...

<b>                          CUSSINS
</b>             This is Martin Hughes. He runs
             Mercedes here in the North.

<b>                           CLOUGH
</b>                     (double-takes)
             What?

<b>                          CUSSINS
</b>             We hear that's what you like to drive.
             A Mercedes?

<b>                          CLOUGH
</b>             It's..what I used to drive at Derby.
             Yes.

<b>                          CUSSINS
</b>             Well, we can't have Leeds United being
             outdone by Derby County, can we? So
             Martin here is going to take you over
             to his showroom and get you sorted
             out.

      They begin to walk to the door. CUSSINS puts his arm round
<b>      CLOUGH...

                Also we figured if you were sitting in

                be a little more bloody lenient with
                your senior players, who've kicked
                off, as you can imagine - being denied
                what's rightfully theirs.

      With a loud ROAR the game against Luton gets under way.

      CLOUGH takes his seat alone in the dugout. Unseen by him, in
      the stands behind him...

      DON REVIE arrives, shaking hands, taking a seat.

      Immediately, as soon as they see REVIE, the LEEDS FANS start
      cheering, "There's only one Don Revie.."

      CLOUGH turns, to see REVIE. Waving back. Acknowledging the
      crowd.

      The LEEDS FANS chant, "There's only one Don Revie!"

      In the directors' box, MANNY CUSSINS notes the reaction of
      the crowd.

      In the press boxes, the JOURNALISTS and TV COMMENTATORS also
      note the reaction of the crowd...

      CLOUGH's face: stinging with humiliation. And as if that
      weren't bad enough...

      "RRROOOOAAARRRRR", Luton score a goal.

      In the director's box: MANNY CUSSINS' face..

      see MANNY CUSSINS and SAM BOLTON waiting. Grim-faced.

      turned and walked away.

      CLOUGH walks in as several players walk in, too. CLOUGH takes
      a seat. CUSSINS calls for quiet...

<b>                            CUSSINS
</b>               This is the worst start to a season
               Leeds has had in twenty years. Four
               points from five games? Second from
               fucking bottom? What's going on? As
               far as I can I see, there's no
               relationship, no understanding between
               players and management. Not a healthy
               one, anyway.

      PLAYERS heads low. Avoiding CLOUGH's eyes.

<b>                            BREMNER
</b>               Perhaps if Mr. Clough were to step
               outside, we would all feel a little
               more like speaking our minds.

      CLOUGH can't help smiling..

</b>                      (under his breath)

      Of course, CUSSINS will reprimand him. Refuse his request.

<b>                            MITCHELL
</b>               Good evening. Tonight the football
               world was stunned by the news that
               Brian Clough has been sacked as
               manager of Leeds United. We'll be
               talking not just to Brian Clough, but
               also to the man he replaced, who's
               success he couldn't emulate, Don
               Revie.

      MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH..

                            MITCHELL (cont'd)
               To Brian Clough first of all. What's
               your reaction to being sacked in this
               fashion?

<b>                            CLOUGH
</b>               Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction
               is one of shock at finding myself here
               with Revie...

<b>                            REVIE
</b>               See? Not so easy to make accusations
               when it's to someone's face...

<b>                            CLOUGH
</b>               ...but in answer to your question, six
               weeks is hardly a long time to be
               given a chance in any job. I would
               hope Revie would get a lot longer time
               in his.

</b>             Do you consider it was possible to

             replace you?

<b>                          REVIE
</b>             Being very, very honest, I think it
             was a difficult job for anyone to do.
             But I do feel Brian Clough, I won't

</b>              And before that, you also topped ALL
              the disciplinary charts. You should
              have been docked points and sent DOWN

<b>                           CLOUGH

              outbursts, his defaming of fellow
              professionals, have brought this game,
              this beautiful game into disrepute.
              Who had one of the best jobs in the
              country, at Derby, and managed to get
              the sack. Who had one of the best
              partners in the game, in Peter Taylor,
              and threw him away. Who was given the
              greatest gift in British football
              Leeds United, a team that in ten years
              hasn't finished outside the top four,
              and took them to the bottom of the
              first division. Yes, it's fair to say
              we all know who you are now.

      AUSTIN MITCHELL's eyes widen.

<b>                           MITCHELL
</b>              OK, gentlemen, we're going to have to
              leave it there..

<b>                           CLOUGH
</b>              Well, let's see where we are in a
              year's time, Donald Revie.
<b>                           REVIE
</b>              Dear oh dear..

<b>                           CLOUGH
</b>              Let's see where we both are in five!

<b>                           AUSTIN MITCHELL
</b>              That's it for tonight's show. I'd like
              to thank Brian Clough and Don Revie
              for joining me...

<b>                           REVIE
</b>              Thank you, Austin.

      The show wraps up. Theme music starts playing. REVIE removes
      his microphone, turns and walks out.

      CLOUGH is left staring, hollow-eyed. Wishing the ground would
      swallow him up..

       A silence. CLOUGH continues to drive.

                              CLOUGH (cont'd)
                 Who is the least mature person in this

                 Who's been making a right arse of

      PETER TAYLOR is working in the garden. He looks up to see
      CLOUGH standing in the gate to his house..

      TAYLOR looks at CLOUGH. Their eyes meet. A poignant moment.

<b>                          TAYLOR
</b>             They've kicked you out, already?

<b>                           CLOUGH
</b>             They have.

<b>                          TAYLOR
</b>             So how long was that?

<b>                          CLOUGH
</b>             Forty-four days.

<b>                           TAYLOR
</b>             Impressive.

      TAYLOR strains not to show his satisfaction..

                          TAYLOR (cont'd)
             So what are you doing here?

<b>                          CLOUGH
</b>             Don't make this difficult for me,
             Pete...you know why I'm here...and I
             won't bloody grovel.

      TAYLOR shrugs, "Please yourself". Turns and starts walking
      inside.

                          CLOUGH (cont'd)
             All right. I'm grovelling. I'm on my
             knees.

      TAYLOR turns. Sees CLOUGH on his knees. Begging for
      forgiveness.

<b>                          TAYLOR
</b>             "I apologize unreservedly for being a

<b>                             CLOUGH

      CLOUGH tails off, realizing he has no option..

                            CLOUGH (cont'd)
               "Please, please baby, take me back."

      CLOUGH's sons watch from the car as PETER TAYLOR opens his
      arms, and the two MEN fall into an embrace.
      But in the clench, TAYLOR's smile fades, his expression
      suddenly becoming serious.

      TAYLOR holds CLOUGH tight, and whispers...

<b>                            TAYLOR

</b>               I know. But it won't stop you.

      A beat. CLOUGH thinks, then..
