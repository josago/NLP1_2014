<b>          INT. BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN
</b>
          22 year old Stephanie Browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep
          as the alarm clock BUZZES. She hits the snooze button and
          plops back down onto the pillow. After a few seconds of pure
          sleeping bliss, she wills herself up.
          She moves through her Ikea furnished bedroom, past a "Hang in
          there, baby" poster and into the bathroom.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER
</b>
          Stephanie turns on the shower. While waiting for the water to
          heat up, she looks into the mirror and with exaggerated
          pronunciation, recites:

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          There is no friction, with proper
          diction. Good sounds abound, when
          the mouth is round.
          She catches herself on the last word, a hint of "Missouri
          twang" slipping through.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Round.
          Yawn. She slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the
          steaming shower.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
</b>
          She opens the refrigerator: A half grapefruit sits next to an
          inviting slice of chocolate cake. She's tempted, but chooses
          the grapefruit.

<b>          EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD PARKING STRUCTURE - MORNING
</b>
          A sunny Southern California day. Commuters speed by.
          Stephanie's FORD FOCUS pulls into the PARKING STRUCTURE,
          across the street from the BANK OF CALIFORNIA. She steps from
          the car, smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward
          the intersection. The traffic signal changes to "Don't Walk".
          A BUSINESS MAN next to her, sprints across the street.
          Stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign. She
          looks down to see a little KITTEN. It rubs against her ankles
          and PURRS.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Well, you're a little cutie.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          2.
</b>          A car's HORN blares, spooking the kitten. It darts into the
          intersection and freezes at the sight of an oncoming VAN.
          Stephanie races into the intersection, snatches up the kitten
          and places it safely down on the other side of the street.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Hey! Slow down!
          The Van roars past. She pets the Kitten. It PURRS and licks
          Stephanie's face. She sets it down.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Go on home. Shoo now!
          She heads for the Bank. The kitten follows. She turns back,
          frowning.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Shoo!

<b>          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA -- DAY
</b>
          Stephanie site at her desk, across from a young MEXICAN
          COUPLE. She studies their mortgage. application.

<b>          MEXICAN MAN
</b>          We keep getting the same thing.
          Because I'm not employed by an
          American company, they won't take
          my application until they get my
          solvency statement. And the Mexican
          Treasury Department says that's
          going to take at least four more
          weeks.

<b>          MEXICAN WOMAN
</b>          And the house will be gone by then.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          It says, here your employed by
          Pemex?

<b>          MEXICAN
</b>          That's right.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Isn't Pemex a subsidiary of Union
          Oil?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>          a MEXICAN MAN
           Yes. So? 0

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          So technically, your employer is an
          American company. I think we can
          make this work. I'll call you this
          afternoon and let you know.
          The happy couple shake Stephanie's hand and exit. ELLEN,
          Stephanie's pretty, twenty two year old, roommate, flops down
          into the seat across from her.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          I need clarification on the shoe
          issue.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Okay...

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          First of all-- you know you've got
          the only perfect pair of black
          dress shoes in L.A. So was that a
          definite, irrevocable, "no way" or
          t just a rather not at this time, "no 
          way"?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          It's an absolutely, positively,
          forget about the shoes already, "no
          way". They're my only good pair and
          I need them in good shape for
          tomorrow.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          What's Up?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Dinner with Ray's parents.
          Ellen picks up a desktop photo: A shot of Stephanie and her
          handsome boyfriend, Ray, locked in an embrace, standing in
          the spray of a waterfall.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Ray's got a nice butt. Really tight

<b>          AND---
</b>          Stephanie takes back her photo.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          1 --I know. Thanks.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          He's a keeper. But I told you about
          his mom, she's another story. I
          used to waitress at her country
          club, and with her, it's all about
          what private school you went to and
          who you know. You still up for that
          promotion? That would help.
          Stephanie looks longingly to...

<b>          THE VACANT OFFICE
</b>          of the former Assistant Manager. The large oak desk. The
          executive chair. Waiting to be filled.
          Stephanie turns back, pushing the thought away.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I'm not putting on a show. She'll
          either accept me for who I am or
          not.

</b>
<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Are you reading self help books
          again?
          The Kitten peers out through Stephanie's partially opened
          desk drawer.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Hello there!
          Ellen reaches for the Kitty but Stephanie waves her off.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          --Shhhl I can't let my boss see
          him.
          Stephanie glances to her manager, MR. JACKS, a heavyset man
          sitting behind a large desk.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          What about the shoes?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I told you. No. Now beat it.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          5.
</b>          Mr. Jacks sneezes, rubs his nose. He looks suspiciously about
          the bank for the source of his allergy. 0

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Uh Oh. You better bring the kitty
          home for me.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Sure. If I can take the shoes.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I told you, no.
          Mr. Jacks sneezes again, his eyes water. He turns to his

<b>          SECRETARY.
</b>
<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          Has someone brought a damned animal
          into my bank?!
          Mr. Jacks looks about the Bank, his twitching nose leading
          him toward Stephanie's desk.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Okay, fine! Take the shoes!

<b>          
</b>          Hidden from Mr. Jack's view, Ellen quickly scoops up the
          Kitten and places it into her purse.
          As Mr. Jacks arrives at Stephanie's desk, he overhears:

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Just don't expect me to take care
          of it.
          This catches Mr. Jack's Attention. He turns to the ladies,
          wondering what they're talking about. Stephanie takes Ellen's
          hand and vigorously shakes it goodbye.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Of course not. I'll take care of
          everything. And thanks for choosing
          Bank of California.
          Ellen plays along.

</b>
<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Okay. Then I'll see you later. I
          mean--- whenever the next time I'm
          in the bank. You know-- for a loan.

<b>          OR--
</b>
<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Goodbye.
          As Ellen passes, Mr. Jacks sneezes again, harder.

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          Someone has definitely brought an
          animal in here.
          He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I don't see any cats. Or any
          animals.

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          Hope to hell, not.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          By the way, I put the paperwork for
          the Mcpherson loan on your desk.

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          Mcpherson?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          That big corporate loan I've been
          trying to set up? It's just
          preliminary but--

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          Oh, right. I'll look it over when I
          get the chance.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Mr. Jacks, I was wondering it you
          had made any decision regarding the
          Assistant Manager's position yet?

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          I'm still deciding. Right now it's
          between Stu and yourself.

</b>
<b>          STEPHANIE 
</b>          Stu? The trainee?
          Stephanie turns to see Stu, the balding loan officer who sits
          at his desk, watching, trying to figure out what Jacks is
          saying to her.

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          I know he's new but he's also quite
          aggressive and we like that. Don't
          get me wrong, you're well liked
          here, but we're also looking for
          someone who's not afraid to crunch
          the numbers and make the tough
          decisions.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Mr. Jacks, I feel that I'm
          perfectly capable of--

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          --I'll let you know as soon as,I
          decide. In the meantime, take him
          through our loan qualifying
          procedures... just in case.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Oh. okay.

<b>          MR JACKS
</b>          And would you mind taking your
          lunch now?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Sure.

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          And on your way back, maybe you
          could bring me a turkey club?
          Stu overhears them as he passes by.

<b>          STU
</b>          Turkey club. Excellent choice, J.J.
          Then to Stephanie:

<b>          STU
</b>          Mind picking one up for me?

<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          8.
</b>
<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          No problem.
          Jacks heads back toward his desk. Stephanie grabs her purse
          and keys and as she heads out, Stu calls after her:

<b>          STU
</b>          On toasted rye! And spicy mustard!
          Stephanie doesn't like fetching lunch for the trainee but
          hides her displeasure.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Sure.

<b>          EXT. UCLA - WESTWOOD CAMPUS - DAY
</b>
          Stephanie enters the Ivy-covered red bricked Department of
          Psychology Building.

<b>          INT. UCLA LECTURE HALL - DAY
</b>
          RAY DALTON, a handsome twenty-nine year old man is lecturing
          before a class of UCLA students. They listen attentively.

<b>          RAY
</b>          The conscious mind abhors
          uncertainty. It seeks a pattern or
          reason for everything. When we
          can't find that pattern or reason,
          we sometimes ascribe it's cause to
          the world of the supernatural. The
          spiritual world is created by the
          human mind to conveniently explain
          everything we can't. So when does a
          belief in the supernatural cross
          into the field of abnormal
          behavior? Where do you, the
          Psychologist, come in? When these
          beliefs negatively affect our
          patients activities of daily
          living. Their jobs, their friends,
          their sense of well being--
          The class bell RINGS.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Tomorrow we'll be covering the
          clinical manifestations of
          psychosis. You'll find it all

<b>          
</b>
<b>          9.
</b>          The students pack up their books. Ray smiles as he sees
          Stephanie enter the lecture hall, holding a bag of deli food.

<b>          INT. RAY'S UNIVERSITY OFFICE - LATER
</b>
          Stephanie eats a salad as she goes over a financial statement
          of the Mcpherson Corporation.
          Ray grades papers.

<b>          RAY
</b>          How're things at the bank? How's
          that new position looking?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I don't know.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Really? You sounded so sure.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Well, now there's this new guy...
          they're considering him too.
          Ray sees how bummed out she is. He moves close, taking her in 
          his arms.

<b>          RAY
</b>          That job needs somebody with your
          experience. They know that.
          Stephanie nods.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Oh, I've got something for you.
          She rummages through her purse and hands Ray an envelope. He
          removes a coin. An old nickle.

<b>          RAY
</b>          A 1925 Indian head! Hey, good find.
          Where'd you get it?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          One of the tellers found it for me.
          Ray puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into
          his pocket.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>          RAY
</b>          Thanks.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I'd better get back to work.
          She quickly gathers her things. Ray returns to grading his
          student's exams. The telephone RINGS. Ray hits the
          speakerphone.

<b>          RAY.
</b>          Doctor Dalton.
          It's the voice of an older woman, TRUDY.

<b>          TRUDY ON SPEAKERPHONE
</b>          Hello dear.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Hi Mom, can you hold on a sec?
          He turns from the phone, whispering to Stephanie:

<b>          RAY
</b>          I'll call you tonight.
          She kisses Ray and exits.

<b>          INT. HALL OUTSIDE RAY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          Stephanie stops at the water fountain for a drink.

<b>          RAY'S VOICE
</b>          Nothing much. Just had lunch with
          Stephanie. And trying to get these
          midterms graded--
          She halts as she hears her name mentioned on Ray's
          speakerphone. She moves closer to Ray's office to eavesdrop:

<b>          TRUDY'S VOICE
</b>          --Stephanie? The one from the farm?

<b>          RAY'S VOICE
</b>          You know who she is. She's coming

</b>          What?

<b>          TRUDY'S VOICE
</b>          I mean she's just a teller at some
          bank right? Raymond there's a
          reason that your father and I
          raised you in a certain way. We
          have expectations.

<b>          RAY'S VOICE
</b>          Please, mom, not this again--

<b>          TRUDY'S VOICE
</b>          I heard that Julie Kulick is
          looking for someone to play tennis
          with. You know she graduated Yale
          law with honors. I'm told she's
          quite a successful attorney now. I
          gave you her number but her mother
          says you never called.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          RAY'S VOICE
</b>          Because I'm with Stephanie. I'm

          A downhearted Stephanie quietly exits.

          As Stephanie pours herself a cup of coffee, Stu and Mr. Jacks
          take the first bites of their sandwiches. Stu makes a face.
          He inspects the sandwich, shakes his head.

<b>          STU

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          You never said that.
          Stu rolls his eyes to Mr. Jacks.
          Stephanie caught Stu's look, but what can she do? She
          exits.

<b>          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - LATER
</b>
          Stephanie sits at her desk, entering data into her computer.
          She glances across the bank to see Stu and Mr. Jacks emerging
          from the break room. Stu is about to return to his desk when
          he remembers something: he's got two tickets to a Dodger game
          that he can't use. Mr. Jacks happily accepts the tickets.
          Stephanie looks to the vacant office of the Assistant
          Manager. She can feel her promotion slipping away.

<b>          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...
</b>          Stephanie looks to the source of the sound...
          A withered hand. An involuntary tremor causes it's yellowed
          fingernails to SCRATCH across the surface of Stephanie's
          desk...

<b>          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...
</b>          The hand belongs to MRS. SYLVIA GANUSH, the aged woman who
          site across from Stephanie. She wears a.formal dress and hat
          from another era. The outfit is threadbare in spots but great
          care has been taken to maintain it.

<b>          MRS. GANUSH
</b>          (Hungarian accent)
          Will you help me?

<b>          STEPHANIE

          Mrs. Ganush coughs up phlegm and spits it into a linen
          handkerchief, which she tucks back into her puree. She hands
          Stephanie a bunch of crumpled papers. Stephanie reviews them.

          The old woman nods.

</b>          This is a delinquency notice... it
          says that the payment on your loan
          was due a number of months ago. And

          Stephanie hides her revulsion.

</b>          Well... do you have the payment
          with you now?

<b>          MRS. GANUSH

          a little more time.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I don't think my manager is going
          to extend you anymore credit. I'd
          like to help but...

</b>          Okay. Wait here.
          Stephanie stands and moves off. The Old Woman picks through a
          bowl of hard candies on Stephanie's desk.
          Stephanie stands before Mr. Jacks. He acknowledges her
          without looking up from his work.

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          What's up?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I've got an elderly woman asking
          for an extension on her mortgage
          payment.. They're in the process of
          repossessing her home. She's on a
          fixed income and she's had some
          medical problems. I was wondering
          if we could give her a break.
          Stephanie hands Mr. Jacks the loan file. He puts on his
          bifocals, studies it.
          Stephanie glances over her shoulder.

<b>          STEPHANIE'S P.O.V. - HER DESK

          tips the bowl of hard candies into her purse. She reaches.
          into her mouth and removes a set of stained dentures that she
          wraps in her linen handkerchief.
          She places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it
          with a wet SUCKING sound. The Old Woman's one good eye,
          wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on the sugary treat.

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          Apparently, we've already granted
          her two extensions. And you know
          on this type of foreclosure, the
          bank makes a sizable amount in
          fees.
          He hands her back the file.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          It would mean I'd have to throw her
          out of her house.

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          Tough decision. Your call.
          He leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies
          her. Stephanie glances to the vacant office of the Assistant
          Manager. The large oak desk. The thick carpet.
          She sees a calculating Stu Rubin eyeing her from his
          workstation.

</b>          Mrs. Ganush, another extension on

<b>          
</b>          Stephanie leafs through the loan documents. She finds a name.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Mrs. Ganush, you've given your

          says here, she lives nearby...

          with her?

<b>          MRS. GANUSH
</b>          I would not burden her.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Okay well, there's several fine
          "assisted living" facilities for
          the elderly.

          never have I begged for anything.
          But I will beg for you now. This

          Let's not make this personal. It's
          just the bank's policy. I'm really
          sorry Mrs. Ganush.
          Stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly
          into a manila folder. she glances up but Mrs. Ganush is gone..
          Stephanie turns in her chair and is startled to see the old
          woman, kneeling before her. She clutches Stephanie's leg with
          her gnarled hands.

<b>          MRS. GANUSH
</b>          Have mercy on me.
          Stephanie stands, tries to pull free, but the old woman will
          not release her leg.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Please, let go.
          Customers turn to look. Mr. Jacks glances up from his desk.

</b>          Please, take your hands off me.
          But the old woman only clutches tighter.

          Mrs. Ganush finally releases her grip and bows her head in
          humiliation.

<b>          MRS. GANUSH
</b>          You shame me.
          She composes herself. Then, slowly stands, puffing up her
          chest. Mu3tering her damaged pride.

</b>          I begged you...
          Her one. good eye fixes it's hardened gaze upon Stephanie.

<b>          MRS. GANUSH
</b>          .and you shame me.
          Mrs. Ganush suddenly grasps Stephanie's arm. Stephanie tries
          to pull away but the old lady's grip is strong. Mrs. Ganush
          reaches out to pluck the charm bracelet from Stephanie's
          wrist-- but the Security Guard intervenes.

<b>          SECURITY GUARD
</b>          I think your business here is
          finished, ma'am.
          The Guard escorts Mrs. Ganush from the bank. Through the
          banks's window, Stephanie watches the Guard lead Mrs. Ganush
          to a old, Chevy Cavalier on the street.
          Stephanie composes herself and when she again looks up, the
          old woman's car is gone.

          Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home. Stephanie loads a pile of
          contracts, a ruler and a desk stapler into a cardboard box
          and exits the bank. The Security guard locks up behind her.

          Stephanie waves as the last of her co-workers drive off. It's
          then that she notices the battered Chevy Caviler. It's parked
          in the structure.
          Stephanie looks closer. There's no one behind the wheel.
          She nervously glances about. No sign of Mrs. Ganush.
          Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car.
          Her FOOTSTEPS echo in the deserted structure, more loudly
          than she would like.
          She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the
          doors behind her. She places the box of contracts on the seat
          next to her. As she starts the engine, she notices a strange
          sight: something moving, skimming along the surface of the
          lot.
          It's Mrs. Ganush's linen handkerchief.
          It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer.
          Stephanie watches transfixed, as it flies right toward her
          car. It dips beneath her hood and is gone. It suddenly sweeps
          up into view, flittering up, over her windshield, and is
          carried off by the wind.
          Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled
          hands come up around her face! Mrs Ganush sits up in the
          back seat of her car! SHRIEKING with rage at Stephanie!

          Mrs. Ganush's razor sharp fingernails lash out towards
          Stephanie's eyes. But Stephanie grabs the old woman's wrists,
          halting her.
          The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's
          throat. Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically
          searches for a weapon. Her hand finds the box on the seat
          next to her. She grabs a handful of colored push pins and
          jams them into the old woman's arm. Mrs. Ganush releases her
          grip. Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before
          Mrs. Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie's hair!. The old
          woman yanks upon it. Stephanie's head is pulled back, over
          the edge of the seat. Ganush braces her feet against the back
          of the front seat to pull even harder... Stephanie's neck is
          now bent so far back it's about to snap!
          Stephanie's hand finds the stapler, trips the release. It
          springs open. She swings it back over her shoulder!
          Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk!
          With each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs. Ganush's
          forehead.
          Ka-Thunk! A lucky shot-- the old lady's white eye is stapled
          shut.
          The old woman HOWLS, but her grip on Stephanie's hair only
          tightens.
          Stephanie, about to black out, throws the car into gear and
          hits the gas. As the car' accelerates, Stephanie fastens her
          shoulder harness with the last of her strength.
          The old woman's stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for her
          to see... an oncoming concrete column.
          Stephanie's car slams into it. Stephanie is held fast by her
          shoulder harness.
          But Mrs. Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat,
          impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force.
          Close shot of the old woman's head slamming into the dash. In
          a spray of broken teeth, her dentures eject from her mouth.

</b>          Both women are dazed from the impact. Stephanie regains her
          wits first. She reaches across Mrs. Ganush and opens the
          passenger door.
          Mrs. Ganush stirs, but before she can come to, Stephanie's
          foot shoves her out. The old woman hits the ground hard but
          she sits up suddenly with a SNARL and starts to climb back
          in. Stephanie shifts the car into reverse. The opened
          passenger door knocks Mrs. Ganush back down to the pavement.
          The car's rear bumper slams into a concrete column. Stephanie
          is dazed.
          Mrs. Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the
          car.
          Stephanie tries to focus. A blurred image in the rear view
          mirror: Mrs. Ganush running closer,'SHRIEKING with old world
          rage!
          The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but
          Stephanie closes it and locks it just in time! Mrs. Ganush
          furiously pulls on the door handle to no,avail.

          The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie's view. Stephanie
          looks about. Where'd she go?
          The old woman pops up into view, raising a chunk of concrete
          and... CRASHI Stephanie SCREAMS as the window shatters.
          The old woman's head juts into the cart She clamps her
          toothless maw down upon Stephanie.'s chin. Suckling it,
          gumming. The old woman's good eye rolls about in ecstacy.
          Stephanie SHRIEKS as she pushes the slobbering head away.
          Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old woman's mouth
          to Ste
          phanie's jaw.
          The old woman's wrinkled hands grope about the front seat.
          She finds her dentures, now damaged from the fight. She
          GRUNTS as she jams them back into her mouth. She comes at
          Stephanie, mouth wide open and SHRIEKING!
          Stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and
          shoves it down the old lady's throat. Mrs. Ganush gags,
          trying to retch up the ruler.

          standing above her, WHEEZING.

          gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of
          Stephanie's coat. She waves the button through the air, and
          breathes out a single word:

          Clouds move past the setting Sun. A shadow falls over

          Stephanie sits up, reaching for her button. But the old woman

<b>          MRS. GANUSH
</b>          You want it?
          Stephanie snatches the button back. Mrs. Ganush smiles
          cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the button into her coat
          pocket.

<b>          MRS. GANUSH
</b>          Soon it will be you, who comes
          begging to me. It begins tonight
          when you hear the cry.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          What cry?

<b>          MRS. GANUSH
</b>          The Lamia. It's coming for you.
          A large black, BUZZING fly lands on Stephanie's face. She
          swats it away. Her vision blurs and she grows dizzy. She
          leans against the car for support. When she finally looks up,
          Mrs. Ganush is gone.

</b>
<b>          RAY
</b>          What about a restraining order?

<b>          OFFICER NAIMARK
</b>          Well that's usually only something
          we do if there's a pattern of
          harassment. But like I said, we'll
          file a report and keep it on record
          in case you do have a continuing
          problem. But once we send an
          officer around to have a word with,
          her, I don't think she'll be
          bothering you again.

          A breeze. She shivers. He wraps his arms around her
          protectively and after a moment, they walk on. Stephanie
          watches wistfully as a YOUNG COUPLE coo over their BABY.
          Behind the couple, Stephanie notices a neon sign in a
          storefront window. It reads: PSYCHIC.

          Rham Jas, a small, dark skinned, fifty year old Indian man.
          He wears a plain black suit and a white turban. His

</b>          Sixty dollars? Isn't that a little
          steep for this kind of thing?

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Then go. There are many who would
          claim to be seers. But they are
          not. Although you would pay them
          little... you would receive
          nothing. If you.are not serious,
          go.
          Rham Jas turns to depart through the beaded curtain.

</b>          Wait.
          She removes some bills from her purse but Ray waves her off,
          handing Rham Jas a credit card.

          sit at a card table. Stephanie giggles with excitement.

          what the fates have in store.
          Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Freud said destiny was not an act
          of fate but rather something
          created by our subconscious to
          control our conscious choices.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          That is true. But... "We should not
          pretend to understand the world
          only by intellect."

<b>          RAY
</b>          Carl Jung...

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Yes. From his treatise
          "Psychological types".

<b>          
</b>          Ray studies this strange man as he strikes a match and lights
          a candle. There's more to him than meets the eye. Ray brushes
          it off.

</b>          Jung-- the New Agers' favorite
          psychologist.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Because he wasn't afraid to bring

          Rham Jas takes a seat at the table, across from Stephanie.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Your hand, please.
          Stephanie extends her hand to Rham Jas. He closes his eyes
          and concentrates. Stephanie smiles excitedly to Ray, who

          the one I told you about... she
          plucked the button right from my
          sleeve.

</b>          Why would she do that?

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          If you would please, both be quiet.
          Rham Jae concentrates, his eyelids flutter. Stephanie appears
          uneasy. The flame of the candle begins to flicker as a breeze
          sweeps through the room. The wind chimes TINKLE. Ray pulls
          his collar closed against the sudden chill in the air. Rham
          Jas's back stiffens.

          perspiration from his brow.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          I think that is enough for now.

          funky Silver Lake rental house.

          Stephanie site at the kitchen table in her flannel pajamas,
          entering financial data into her laptop. An episode of
          "Desperate Housewives" plays in the background on TV. A
          baking timer CHIMES. Stephanie removes a beautifully browned
          cake from the oven and sets it on the counter to cool. Her
          roommate, ELLEN, comes down the stairs, snuggling the kitten.

          Ellen exits.
          Stephanie places butter into a mixer for the cake frosting.
          Through the kitchen window we can see Ellen walking down the
          path, toward the street. She steps through the iron gate,
          latching it closed behind her.

<b>          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Ellen's car pulls away. The wind kicks up, whisking leaves
          about, as though something where moving up the path and
          toward the front gate of the house.

          An unsettling SHRIEK! what the hell was that? Stephanie sets
          down the measuring cup.
          She moves to the front door. Locks it.
          She looks out the kitchen window. The iron. gate is now open.

          1 Wind sweeps through the kitchen, whipping dead leaves about.
          The hanging pans bang together! KLANG! KLANG!
          Stephanie forces the windows closed.
          The wind dies. The room grows eerily quiet.
          A car passes in the street below. It's headlights sweep
          across the house. The headlight beams throw moving shadows on
          the wall. Stephanie notices that one particular shadow is
          darker than the others. It becomes the silhouette of Mrs.
          Ganush, but there's no one in the room with her.
          The car passes and the shadows vanish.
          Sensing something, the Kitten arches it's back. Now Stephanie
          feels it. A presence. The light bulb begins to sputter.
          She holds her breath, listens.
          The floorboards CREAK. Something is walking towards her. She
          spins around, but there's nothing there. The SOUND of
          footsteps drawing closer.
          She backs against the wall, trembling.
          Suddenly Stephanie's face is struck by an invisible hand! She
          cries out. Her mouth is bleeding.
          She runs for the door. She's almost there. Her hand reaches
          for the knob, when something unseen picks her up. She SCREAMS
          as she is thrown against the wall. She falls to the floor.
          Lifting her head, she catches her own reflection in the

<b>          WINDOW:
</b>          In the reflection, as the light bulb flickers, we see a flash
          of ghostly hands that grope at her body. They reach up
          through the floor, and clutch at her legs, buttocks and
          breasts.

</b>          I don't understand.

<b>          STEPHANIE

          That old woman... after she knocked
          me down, and pulled the button from

          sweatshirt, concludes his interview with Stephanie. He
          carries a small black medical bag as he steps from the living
          room to speak with Ray.

          some paranoia and a sense of panic.
          Classic symptoms of a post
          traumatic stress disorder. Probably
          a result of being assaulted by that
          old woman.
          Doctor Rangavertz scribbles out a prescription and hands it
          to Ray.

          She tries to fall back asleep, but the sound of a dripping

          She gets control. Ray smooths out the tangled hair from her
          sweaty face. He looks deeply into her eyes, afraid of what's
          happening to her. The phone in the next room, RINGS.'Ray

          Ganush away.
          But the Old Woman's yellowed teeth SNAP and press ever

          The muscles in Stephanie's arms are trembling. She is
          weakening. Mrs. Ganush, closes in, about to clamp her teeth
          down upon Stephanie's face when--
          Stephanie suddenly awakens with a GASP. It was all a dream
          within a dream.
          She bolts up out of bed. Takes her bearings. She's alone in

          moves to her desk, hoping Mr. Jacks won't notice. She's
          almost there when Stu Rubin "accidently" knocks a note book

          Stu is taken aback by Stephanie's outburst. He retreats to
          his desk in confusion.
          Stephanie sits, rattled. A drop of blood falls onto a piece
          of paper on her desk. The blood is trickling from her nose.
          Stephanie grabs a tissue to halt the bleeding. She looks
          down to see a large black fly land upon the drop of blood.
          She gasps and stands, her mind racing. She knows what she
          must do. She finds Mrs. Ganush's loan documents. She stuffs
          them into a folder, grabs her purse and bolts for the exit.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Lamia. Right. That's the word the 
          old woman used.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          It is a nasty spirit. A taker of
          souls. A creature of misfortune for
          you and those around you. It is
          often summoned by the Gypsies for
          their dour deeds. On the third day
          the Lamia comes for the owner of
          the accursed object.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Accursed object? What object?

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Something that the old woman took
          from you, cursed, then gave back.
          Now it dawns on Stephanie. She looks to the threads on her
          coat.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          The button...

<b>          
</b>          Stephanie's hand slowly emerges from her coat pocket. The
          thin brass button in her palm.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          .this?
          She holds the button up for him to inspect. But it's presence
          makes him uneasy..He wags his finger back and forth. She
          lowers it.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          What if I just burn the thing?

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          No matter what condition the button
          is in, you would still be the
          owner. The Lamia would still come
          to take you.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Take me where?

<b>          NO

</b>          Rham Jas gives her a sad smile and closes the text. She
          knows where. Stymied, she tucks the button back into her coat
          pocket.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          There's got to be something I can
          do.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Yes. There are many ways to appease
          a spirit. The simplest is a blood
          offering. An animal sacrifice. A
          small creature would do. You could
          sacrifice a chicken. It's all in
          here...
          Rham Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he
          sets before her.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          No way. I'm a vegetarian. I'm a
          member of PETA, for Christ's sake.
          I don't go around killing animals.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          You will be surprised what you will
          be willing to do when the Lamia
          comes for you.
          She considers his words, looks down to the book.
          CLOSE ON A DIAGRAM OF AN ANIMAL SACRIFICE - A creature's
          heart being cut from it's body.
          CAMERA pulls back to reveal that Stephanie now site at her
          kitchen table, reading the book. We see other diagrams: The
          heart being placed into a skillet over an open fire. The
          burial of the smoking heart. Stephanie's kitten PURRS, as it
          rubs against her leg.
          Stephanie closes the book, shutting out the disturbing
          images.
          She hears the SHRIEK of the rusty gate outside. She moves to
          the window and peers out. The rusting iron gate is open.
          Stephanie senses a change in the room... Shadows shift and
          grow deeper. The air is suddenly oppressive. Something is
          coming.

          1b But then--

<b>          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...
</b>          She runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door.

<b>          INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM
</b>
          She can hear the sound of the SCRATCHING, even here.,
          She rushes to the phone picks it up: No dial tone, only high
          pitched static, the sounds of the Lamia buried within.
          She sets the phone down.
          For a moment all is quiet. Should she go back down? Then she
          hears a tiny SQUEAKING. The knob on the front door, turning.
          Then the CLICK of the lock, followed by the CREAKING of rusty
          hinges as the front door swings open. She calls through her
          bedroom door.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Ellen? !
          But it's not Ellen. 
          Stephanie puts her,ear to the door. The sound of an animal's
          hooves on wood. Something is climbing the stairs. It stops
          outside her bedroom door.
          Stephanie holds her breath, listening.
          She sees a shadow beneath the crack in the door.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I know that you're there!
          The window behind her explodes into the room with a deafening

<b>          ROAR!
</b>          She ducks for cover. Another window is blown inward and the
          glass sent her way. She SCREAMS and runs toward the bathroom
          door. It SLAMS shut in her face!
          BOOM! Another window is SHATTERED by the angry, unseen thing.
          The force knocks her to the bed. The blankets are torn from
          the mattress, throwing Stephanie to the floor. The bedsheets
          whisk around the room, flapping and twisting about like
          1b drunken ghosts.

          into the air, suspending her upside down, taking her on a
          wild and harrowing ride about the room.
          Abruptly all the madness halts: She drops to the floor. The
          bedsheet wafts to the ground beside her. Whatever it was,
          .it's gone. It's quiet now. A terrified Stephanie sits,
          shaking, in the wreckage of her room.

<b>          INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - LATER
</b>
          With a trembling hand, she jams a ZAGNUT BAR into her mouth,
          and drops the wrapper onto a pile of others on the floor.
          She chases it with a double shot of Maker's Mark Whiskey. She
          removes a knife from the butcher block and hefts. it's weight.
          She sings out, in a sweet but trembling voice.

          She moves closer until her face fills the screen.

          The distant SCREAM of the kitten is heard. We hear it again
          and again until it is finally silenced. 4

</b>          No. Why would there be blood?

<b>          ELLEN

          Stephanie glances at the red spot on her sleeve.

<b>          STEPHANIE

          inside making a salad and... I cut
          a tomato and I must have gotten it

          Ellen gives her roommate a worried look.

          Stephanie closes her bedroom door so Ellen can't see the
          damage. Stephanie cleans up the place. As she picks up some
          of her things, she comes across an old photograph.
          CLOSER: It's a photo of 16 year old Stephanie. She was
          obese. Her belly unflatteringly protrudes from beneath a "4-
          H" tee shirt. She stands before some barnyard animals, a
          bucket of feed in her hand.

          tears up the photo and dumps it in the waste basket.

          The music grows lighter as Stephanie models a couple of
          dresses in front of Ellen, who's helping decide on the
          evening's wardrobe.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Go with the short skirt.

          She hold up a longer, more formal dress.

<b>          ELLEN

          trying to impress you with my
          conservative taste."

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          But that's what I want it to say.
          Ellen shakes her head, no. Stephanie takes a last look in the
          mirror, decides to go with the short skirt.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Okay. This is it.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Tell me again... the exact words he
          used.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Just that this little cabin would
          be a great place for us to really
          connect and that there was

          about with me.

          She tunes in a rock station and turns it up loud. She smiles
          at Ray and takes his hand.
          She hits the gas and her Ford Focus opens up, accelerating
          down a long, tree lined street, the wind blowing through
          their hair.

          Ray gives her a reassuring nod.
          The front door opens revealing Ray's parents, GEORGE AND

          thinly veiled disapproval. Stephanie self-consciously tugs it
          lower.

          Trudy has to stifle her gag reflex. George returns and hands
          Ray and Stephanie a cocktail.

          for a promotion. Right, Steph?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I'd like to think so... actually,
          It depends. If I could close this
          big account that I'm working on, it
          would really help.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Well, I was reading the Wall Street
          Journal and found this innovative
          medical supply company that was
          interested in expanding but didn't
          have the liquidity. I met with
          their CFO and presented a formula
          for restructuring-some of their
          long term debt. It created an
          environment where I was able to
          offer them a rather attractive loan

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You sure sound like you've got a
          lot going for you, Stephanie.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          Your mother must be very proud.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I suppose. I don't see her much.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          Why is that?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Well, ever since my dad died she
          doesn't talk much. She mostly stays
          on the farm and... keeps to
          herself. Because...
          There is an awkward silence.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          Does your mother have a drinking
          problem?

<b>          RAY
</b>          Cut her some slack, mom, she--

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Yes. I'm afraid she does.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          I'm sorry. It's nothing to be
          ashamed of. And I find your honesty
          refreshing.

          other girl Ray brought by... What
          was her name? Alicia? She was

          Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at
          Ray.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          No. Not at all. That's what mom's
          are for.

</b>          Thank you, Stephanie. Maybe I will
          try that Harvest cake of yours,
          after all.
          Trudy cuts herself a piece. Stephanie tastes the cake and
          emits a tiny cough.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Excuse me.
          She clears her throat. But the cough returns, grows larger.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Just a little tickle in my--
          She stands and takes a few steps away from the table. Ray
          looks on concerned.

</b>          She waves him off, clearing her throat. Tries to smile
          demurely, but erupts with a harsh cough. She's choking on
          something and is trying to bring it up from deep within her
          throat. With all her might she emits a BARK and a large
          black fly buzzes out of her mouth.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          Oh! OH MY GOD!
          The fly lazily BUZZES across the table, slowly circling
          Trudy's head.
          Trudy spits out a mouthful of harvest cake into her napkin.
          George lowers his fork and pushes away his plate of unclean
          farm cake.
          Ray is baffled, too stunned to speak.
          Stephanie's gaze shifts to the kitchen door. From The other
          side, she hears the sound of a hoofs.
          Ray tries to cover for Stephanie:

<b>          RAY
</b>          I'm so sorry, Stephanie. I don't
          know how that fly got. into your--

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          --Wait. What's that sound?

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          What sound-?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          SHHH! Listen!
          Trudy listens along with the others. They can't hear
          anything. But Stephanie hears the FOOTSTEPS drawing closer.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          I'm sorry, I can't hear anything.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          (mutters under her breath)
          Must be deafer than a post!
          But Trudy heard that and takes offense. But before she can
          say anything, a SHADOW appears at the base of the door.
          Stephanie stands and shouts at it:

<b>

<b>

          fuck alone!
          Stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past
          Trudy's head. It shatters against the base of the door,
          spraying everyone with bits of broken china and fish. The
          shadow and FOOTSTEPS are gone.
          Ray rushes to her side.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Steph, it's okay! There's nothing
          there.
          She looks about. George and Trudy regard Stephanie as if she
          were mad.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I... I think I'd better go.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          I think that's best, dear.
          She heads for the door. Ray starts to go after her but his

<b>          
</b>          mother stops him.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          Let her go, Ray. She's a sick girl.

<b>          RAY
</b>          She needs me.
          Trudy grabs Ray's arm.

<b>          TRUDY
</b>          I'm telling you not to go after
          her.
          Ray gently pulls free of his mother's grasp and chases after
          Stephanie.

<b>          EXT. DALTON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Ray rushes outside stopping Stephanie as she is about to get
          into her car.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          The thing that's coming for me.
          What the old woman sent.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Listen to me. What you're going
          through right now-- It's like the
          doctor said, it's a stress reaction
          and --

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          No. I wanted to believe that-- but
          it's real, Ray. You just don't want
          to open your eyes to it because it
          threatens you. Because if I'm right
          and there is something out there,
          then you'd have to throw out
          everything you teach. And where'd
          that leave you? Like a plow without
          a mule.
          Ray just stares at her. A long moment passes as he wonders if
          maybe she isn't right.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Unless you're willing to take a
          chance and believe in me, I can't
          be with you any more.
          She steps into the car and drives off. Ray watches her tail
          lights, as they vanish into the night.

<b>          EXT. ECHO PARK HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
          An older home with bars on the front windows. Stephanie
          knocks at the front door.
          She turns toward a distant sound: A chilling, high-pitched
          SQUEAL. Was it just a bus's air brakes... or something more?
          When Stephanie turns back, the door has been opened a crack.
          An EYE peers out at her.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Hi. Yes. I came to see Sylvia
          Ganush. Is she here?
          The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old
          Gypsy girl. ILENKA GANUSH. Bottle of beer in her hand, long
          black hair, earrings and a snake tatoo on'her neck. She
          wears a low cut shirt and tight shorts.
          EASTERN EUROPEAN HIP HOP and LAUGHTER are heard from within
          the house.

<b>          ILENKA
</b>          I'm Ilenka, Sylvia's granddaughter.
          Who are you?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Stephanie Brown. I'm... sort of...
          a friend of hers. Actually, I've
          been trying to help her with a loan

<b>          THAT-
</b>
<b>          ILENKA
</b>          Wait. I know who you are. Grandma
          told me you'd come. You're the
          woman from the bank. The one who
          took her house.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          It was really the bank that took
          the house. I just work there. In
          fact, I tried to help your grandma
          get-the house back, but my boss
          wouldn't let me.
          Ilenka knows she's lying. Stephanie knows that she knows.

<b>          ILENKA
</b>          That's not what happened, is it?
          Are you going to stand here on my

<b>          ILENKA
</b>          I can tell. You know, you caused my
          grandma a lot of pain. That house
          was her pride. When you took that
          from her, she had nothing left.
          You're not welcome here.
          She starts to close the door. Stephanie halts her. Desperate
          now, no where else to turn.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Okay! I did it. It was me who
          denied her the loan. I was trying,
          to get ahead at work and I
          shouldn't have done it. It was
          wrong.

<b>          ILENKA
</b>          Damn straight it was wrong.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          And I'm ashamed about it. And I'm
          going to get down on my hands and
          knees and beg her to forgive me.
          She said-that I hadn't suffered
          enough. But now I think she'll see
          that I have and then maybe she'll
          let me...

<b>          ILENKA
</b>          .make everything all right for
          her, is that it?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Yes.
          Ilenka gives a bitter, cryptic smile. She motions for
          Stephanie to follow. They enter a room filled with young
          Gypsies drinking, smoking and talking loudly in a Slavic
          tongue.
          A WOMAN WITH A CANE shouts as she throws a pair of dice. A
          Hungarian man with a long, braided ponytail, curses his bad

          the Corpse of Mrs. Ganush!
          As per the custom of the Gypsy wake, there is no coffin, just
          her dead body that rests atop a coffee table.
          Stephanie has landed atop the corpse! The leg of the coffee
          table breaks under the weight of the two women. Stephanie
          tumbles to the ground, the corpse landing atop her. The crowd
          of mourners GASP.
          The dead woman's opened mouth bobs up and down upon
          Stephanie's chin, as through it were once again suckling it.
          Stephanie shoves the corpse off of her and backs away in
          revulsion.

</b>          Still going to make everything all
          right?
          The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table.
          Ilenka addresses the crowd in Hungarian. She tells them that
          it was this white trash farm girl that threw her grandmother
          t from her home and that she now bears the curse of Lamia. 
          A mother shields her daughter's eyes from the sight of
          Stephanie, the cursed one, then hurriedly kisses her
          .crucifix. A man spits at her feet then walks off.

<b>          STEPHANIE

          He's always running off, have you
          noticed that?

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          Stephanie. I was in the back yard
          and I saw where the ground was dug
          up. I started digging and... You
          buried that little kitty in our
          backyard. What happened?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I didn't want to tell you. It fell
          out the window and died. It's sad,

</b>
<b>          ELLEN
</b>          I found the bloody knife in the

</b>          I can't get the twenty thousand.

</b>          How much?!
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that we are'in a PAWN SHOP. Men
          haggle loudly in Arabic over the price of a gold chain. The

          He hangs up. The line goes dead. She tries to throw the phone
          but it's attached with a short metal cord. She turns to the
          Pawn Broker.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I'll take it!
          Stephanie thinks about how she'll get the extra cash. She
          hesitantly dials a number on the pay phone. It rings and
          rings as she glances to a picture buried deep in her wallet:
          A. photo of...
          The younger, obese Stephanie and her stern looking Mother.
          Both stand before a bleak snow covered, mid-western farm.

          pretty sick and I need to borrow
          some money for an operation. I need

</b>          Mr. Jacks, this is kind of awkward
          for me... I know it's not official
          yet, but I was wondering if I could
          get a copy of the employment
          contract for the new position you
          offered me?

<b>          MR. JACKS
</b>          The assistant manager's position?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Yes. See, one of my family members
          is having a little emergency which
          requires me to get them an

<b>          MR. JACKS

          loan pending,,I find out that they
          just made their deal over at First
          National. I got a call in to see,
          what exactly happened but right now
          this doesn't look too good for you
          or me. So this assistant manager
          promotion has been delayed. In
          fact, I think that with everything
          that's been happening, I'm gonna
          have to give that job to Stu.
          Stephanie is devastated.

<b>          STEPHANIE

<b>          STEPHANIE

<b>          SHUAN SAN DENA
</b>          I lost a young boy's soul to the

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          That's reassuring.

<b>          SHAUN SAN DENA
</b>          I was an. inexperienced seer then.
          I've learned much since that woeful
          day. I have waited these long years
          for a chance at redeeming myself. A
          chance to destroy the foul thing.
          Tonight my chance will come. But to
          summon it, I will need your help.

<b>          STEPHANIE

          He knew I would sense his spirit
          in this place as I have sensed
          others. It was to be our way of 
          being together after he died. In
          earlier times it was a sacred place
          to the Tuanteteck indians. And
          their stories told that the place
          was a burial ground of the "old
          ones" that inhabited the earth
          before them. Here, there is a
          particular alignment of energies. A
          confluence, that allows doorways to
          be opened. Through which, we might
          pass.

          Milos removes the tea.

<b>          SHAUN SAN DENA
</b>          It is time for us to begin.
          Shaun San Dena turns out the electric lights, leaving only
          the tables' candlelight for illumination.
          We hear the BLEATING of a goat. Stephanie startles. Milos
          reenters the room pulling a black goat along by a chain. The
          goat catches sight of Stephanie. It BLEATS in fear and
          attempts to run. But Milos holds it fast and tethers it to a
          post. He moves to the table and lifts a velvet cloth
          revealing a large cattle slaughtering blade.

<b>          SHAUN SAN DENA
</b>          Lord Jesus bless this knife and

          She makes the sign of the cross. she pours a .vial of holy
          water over the blade. She turns to Stephanie.

<b>          SHAUN SAN DENA

          Stephanie leans close to speak quietly with Rham Jae.

</b>          Yes. Now repeat these words... I

          Rham Jae waits for Stephanie's response. She's shifts in her
          seat uncomfortably.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I welcome the dead into my soul...

          search the room.

</b>          echoes about the room.

<b>          SHAUN SAN DENA

</b>          Stephanie grips the table.
          And just when the SCRATCHING SOUND is deafening... All

          Stephanie holds her breath.
          A wind whips up in the room sending papers whirling about,.
          yet all the windows are closed.
          Shaun San Dena's eyes roll up into her head. She emits a low
          and powerful MOAN. Her head slumps onto her shoulders. Then
          she straightens with a new vigor. Stephanie and Rham Jas
          watch as her lips move rapidly and a garbled sound comes out

          Shaun San Dena's chair abruptly spins about to face

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          It was my manager, Jim Jacks. 
          He was the one ! He--

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Silence! Lamia, please, surely we
          can dissuade you from taking this
          insignificant woman? Surely she's
          not worthy of your greatness.
          The possessed Shaun San Dena laughs.

<b>          SHAUN SAN DENA
</b>          (demonic voice)
          No! I will enjoy watching her skin
          blister and pop in hell's flame. I
          come for her!
          Stephanie quickly grabs Shaun San Derna's hand and places it
          on the goat's head.
          Shaun San Dena's eyes clear for a moment as she struggles to
          regain control.
          Now there are two spirits battling within her. She attempts
          t to force the spirit of the Lamia from her body and into the
          goat. The Goat BLEATS and bucks wildly as the spirit is
          transferred. Milos raises up the slaughtering blade.

<b>          SHAUN SAN DENA
</b>          (demonic voice)
          No! You--

<b>          GOAT
</b>          (demonic voice)
          --tricked me!
          The possessed goat emits a terrible cry! The bone chilling
          SHRIEK of Lamia! It's oval eye reflects the blade as it
          descends toward it. The possessed Goat jerks aside and the
          blade misses, slicing into the chair.
          As Milos raises the blade for another blow, the goat bites
          his hand. In that moment, the spirit of the Lamia is
          transferred to him.
          A Possessed Milos SCREAMS and spins toward Stephanie, glaring
          at her with black goat eyes. He SHOUTS at her in a gibberish
          of tongues! His body jerks up into the air. He dances a jig
          atop the table, now laughing uncontrollably.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Lamial I command you to leave this--
          A chair sails through the air and shatters across Rham Jas'
          back, knocking him to the ground.
          Milos' body is hurled up against the chandelier, shattering
          it. Glass rains down upon Stephanie.
          on the ceiling, Milos is spun.about like a pin wheel.
          Stephanie races for the door but a
          .huge bureau lurches in
          front of her, blocking her path.
          Rham Jas rouses a stunned Shaun San Dena.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          You must banish the spirit!
          Shaun San Dena places her hands on her ayes, then over her
          heart and chants an ancient Gypsy incantation up toward
          Milos.
          Milos SHRIEKS. A white vapor streams from his body as the
          Lamia is torn from him.

<b>          MILOS
</b>          (in his normal voice)
          Stop the chanting. I beg you!
          But Shaun San Dena only chants louder. Milos SCREAMS grow
          more intense as-his body spasms in pain. Stephanie grasps at
          Shaun San Dena.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          For god's sake, stop the chanting,
          it's killing him!
          Rham Jas pushes her aside.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          You must not stop!
          A withered pair of hands reach down from above and clutch at
          Stephanie's face! It is Mrs. Ganush that now floats above
          her! Her long yellowed fingernails scratching at Stephanie's
          skin.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          No! Get her off!
          Mrs. Ganush grabs at Stephanie's head. Stephanie pulls away
          but it costs her a clump of hair that Mrs. Ganush rips from
          her head.
          Mrs. Ganush opens her mouth... wide... wider still... she
          vomits out Stephanie's dead cat. It lands atop the table.
          Stephanie screams uncontrollably.
          Shaun San Dena, is trembling as her chanting comes to a
          climax.
          Mrs. Ganush changes back to the possessed Milo. The last of
          the white vapor is torn from Milos body as the spirit of the
          Lamia leaves him. Milos falls to the floor and all is quiet.
          An ashen faced Shaun San Dena halts her chant.

<b>          10 STEPHANIE 
</b>          Is it gone?
          Stephanie notices that the cat has vanished. Was it ever
          there?
          Rham Jae kneels at Milos' side. He's starting to come around.
          Milos stands, shaken. The Lamia is gone.
          Shaun San Dena grabs at her chest, struggles for breath.
          Stephanie rushes over to steady her.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Let me help you...

<b>          SHAUN SAN DENA
</b>          My heart.
          Shaun San Dena collapses into Stephanie's arms. Rham Jas
          moves to assist her. They lower Shaun San Dana to the floor.

</b>          She's not breathing.
          Rham Jas attempts to administer CPR to no avail.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          My God. My God...
          He checks her pulse one last time. The CPR is finally halted.
          Rham Jas closes her eyes, then touches her forehead, praying:

          Stephanie and Rham Jas watch as PARAMEDICS load the covered
          body of Shaun San Dena into the ambulance. They close the
          doors and drive away.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          It's sad:

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Yes.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Strange how things work out. She
          waited years for another chance to
          overcome the lamia ..and finally
          she did.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          No. I'm afraid you misunderstand.
          Rham Jas looks at her with pity.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          What?

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          The,Lamia can not'be banished by a

          thing...

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          No. You saw her drive the Lamia
          from the seance. That is all. It
          will be back.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          But then, what am I supposed to do?
          Rham Jas shrugs. He fishes in his pocket for his car keys.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Perhaps on this final evening, you
          should finish up the business of
          this world. For before the night is
          through, the Lamia will come for
          the owner of the accursed object.

<b>          STEPHANIE'S HAND
</b>          Slowly emerges from her coat pocket. She studies the thin
          brass button in her palm. 0

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Unless, of course... you were no
          longer the owner.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          No longer the owner? I don't
          understand.
          Rham Jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank
          envelope. He places the button within and seals it.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          The Lamia comes for the owner of
          the accursed object. Just make a
          gift of it...
          To demonstrate, he hands the envelope to Stephanie.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          .and you've given away the curse.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Because we are speaking of murder.
          Stephanie looks from the envelope containing the button to
          Rham Jas. She places the envelope carefully into the side
          'pocket of her purse. Rham Jas tries to conceal the sadness
          and fear he feels for her.

<b>          RHAM JAS
</b>          Whatever you decide, you have until
          sunrise.'
          She nods goodbye as Ray's car pulls up. Ray opens the door.
          for her and she gets in.

<b>          INT. RAY'S BMW - NIGHT
</b>
          Ray and Stephanie drive through the quiet Pasadena
          neighborhood.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Is it over?
          Stephanie, stares at her envelope, thinks about telling him,
          then...

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Yes. It's all over.
          Ray squeezes her hand. Appreciating the two of them now more
          than ever.
          Stephanie SCREAMS as...
          MRS. GANUSH.appears in the headlights, standing on the road
          before them! Ray hits the breaks. The car SCREECHES to a
          halt!
          Stephanie's purse with the envelope and.some of Ray's papers
          fall to the floor.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Are you okay?
          Stephanie nods, catching her breath.

</b>          That guy came out of nowhere.
          Stephanie looks to the figure in the road. Mrs. Ganush is
          gone. In her place is an old man who mutters angrily at them
          and moves on.

<b>          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT -- LATER
</b>
          RAY'S BMW pulls up and Stephanie gets out.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Are you'still okay about the Santa
          Barbara trip?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Yes, everything's fine.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Okay. Our train leaves tomorrow
          morning. Seven A.M. When do you
          want me to pick you up?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          It's better if we meet at the
          D station. There's something I've got
          to do on the way.
          Stephanie suddenly' clutches at her purse. The envelope is
          gone!

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Wait! Where's my envelope?

<b>          RAY
</b>          What envelope?
          She opens the car door and frantically rummages around the
          floor, through Ray's papers.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          It's got to be here!
          Then, Stephanie comes upon something under the seat. She
          smiles and stands. A white envelope held tightly in her
          hand.

</b>          The time is 1:30 A.M.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          drinks coffee and stares at the white envelope that's tucked
          into the side pocket of her purse. She scans the patrons and
          considers giving it to each of them, then one by one, rejects
          the idea.

<b>          A WAITRESS
</b>          Comes by, removes a dirty dish and refills her coffee.

</b>          takes a deep breath, stands and walks to his table.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I wonder if you could help me out?
          The Old Man looks up, sees her desperation.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Just take the envelope and I'll

          The Old Man considers. He reaches for the envelope when an
          OLD WOMAN, his wife, hobbles toward the table. The Old Man
          helps her sit and puts away her cane. They turn to Stephanie
          who withdraws the envelope.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Never mind.
          Stephanie returns to her seat, ashamed at what she almost 
          did.
          She returns the envelope to the purse pocket, racking her
          brains, trying to think of some way out of this. Her gaze
          lands upon a stack of newspapers on the next table. She
          grabs the paper and finds the OBITUARIES.

<b>          CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER:

          hankie. It.flies against Stephanie's windshield and gets
          caught on the wiper blade. Stephanie GASPS. It flaps in the

          swerves.
          Her car crashes into a tree.

<b>          LONG SHOT - CRASHED CAR

          flash of lightning. It illuminates:
          The wrought iron gates of the OAKWOOD CEMETERY. A hill of
          tombstones beyond.

<b>          EXT. OAKWOOD CEMETERY - RAINY NIGHT

          A light drizzle falls as Stephanie'searches the graveyard for
          the burial place of Mrs. Ganush. She carries the shovel
          defensively, ready to swat at anything that might leap out at
          her.
          She stops before a freshly dug grave. A temporary marker
          reads the name. "Sylvia Ganush".
          She's scared now, not sure if she can really go through with
          it. A church bell TOLLS five times. There's no time to think 
          about it. Stephanie looks around to make sure no one is
          watching, then starts to dig.

<b>          DISSOLVE TO:
</b>          LATER - It's raining harder. The hole Stephanie digs is now
          several feet deep.
          CLUNK: The shovel has hit the buried coffin. The rain
          intensifies.

<b>          DISSOLVE TO:
</b>          LATER - Mud is pouring down the sides of the grave. In the
          bottom of the pit Stephanie has unearthed the simple pine
          casket. She jams the shovel blade between two boards and
          pries off the coffin's top and shoves it aside.
          A lightning flash illuminates the corpse. Mrs. Ganush's white
          eye is open and staring at Stephanie.
          Stephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from
          her coat.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I'm giving it back to you.
          She grabs Mrs. Ganush's hand and tries to get her clenched
          fist to open, but rigor morris has locked it shut. Stephanie
          pulls with all her might, causing...

<b>          MRS. GANUSH'S CORPSE
</b>          to lurch up and out of the coffin. Her dead arms, thrown
          forward from the momentum, wrap around Stephanie. Stephanie
          SCREAMS! The withered face leers! Stephanie pushes the corpse
          away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          You'll take it, all right...
          She picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old
          woman's mouth, wedging it between her teeth. She pries the
          jaw open. Mud and rivulets of water begin pouring down into
          the grave from all sides. The body of Mrs. Ganush is quickly
          being re-buried.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I, Stephanie Brown, do hereby make
          a formal gift of this button to
          you, Sylvia Ganush.
          She jams the white envelope down the old woman's throat.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Choke on it, bitch.
          She kicks the old woman's jaw.. It SNAPS shut, trapping the
          envelope between her broken teeth.
          Muddy water cascades down into the grave, flowing over Mrs..
          Ganush's face. It covers everything, except the jutting
          envelope and a single, staring white eye.
          Stephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick.
          She grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it
          tears away, unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up
          to her armpits.

<b>          THE HEAD OF MRS. GANUSH
</b>          Bobs up, through the mud. The Old Woman is grinning, with the

<b>          THE INFLUX OF MUD
</b>          pushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie. Her grinning
          face led mashed against Stephanie's cheek. Stephanie's SCREAM
          is cut short as she and Mrs. Ganush disappear beneath the
          mud.
          The only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain. CAMERA STARTS TO
          PULL AWAY when...

</b>          rips up through the mud, grasping the tree root.

          STEPHANIE steps from the shower, quickly towels her hair. She
          stops for a moment and studies herself in the mirror. She
          has survived. The phone RINGS in the bedroom; the machine
          picks up.

<b>          MR. JACKS' VOICE

          Sorry I'm calling so early-- but

<b>          MR. JACKS' VOICE
</b>          Apparently he stole your file on 4
          the Mcpherson loan and then tried
          to broker his own deal at First
          Federal. I guess he thought we
          wouldn't find out. When I
          confronted him he broke down crying
          and well, we won't be seeing him
          around anymore.

          The Eastern sky is growing brighter. Stephanie's car pulls
          into the lot. She removes a week end bag from her trunk and
          walks briskly toward the station.

<b>          MR JACKS
</b>
<b>          (V.O.)
</b>          It looks like the loan's coming
          back to us. And I just wanted you
          to know that come Monday morning,
          that assistant manager's position
          will be waiting for you.

          She glances down at her own coat. Notes the missing button.
          with distaste.
          Inside, a SALESWOMAN is preparing to open the shop.
          Stephanie taps on the window, shouts through the glass:

          coat in the window.
          The Saleswoman considers.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          My boyfriend and I are taking a
          very special trip this morning.
          Stephanie's smile is bright. Her joy is contagious. The
          Saleswoman relents and lets Stephanie in.

          Moments before sunrise, the sky is streaked red.
          Ray waits on the train platform, clutching two tickets and a
          small garment bag. Behind him, other Passengers arrive. From
          his pocket, he removes a velvet case. He opens it and peeks
          t inside A diamond ring. He stows it back in his pocket.
          He looks for Stephanie.
          Then, his face brightens as Stephanie emerges from the crowd,
          radiant in her, new coat.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Ray!
          Ray embraces her and grabs her luggage. A TRAIN WHISTLE
          sounds as the train approaches.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Is everything okay?

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          Great.

          try and live up to that.
          They share an intimate moment. A romantic kiss. He breaks off
          and smiles.

<b>          RAY
</b>          Did I tell you, you look great?

<b>          RAY
</b>          What'd you do with your old coat?
          Just the mention of it, makes her face darken.

<b>          STEPHANIE
</b>          I got rid of it. I never want to
          see it again.

<b>          RAY

          Ray produces the envelope. And from it, withdraws... THE

</b>          CAMERA RACES INTO A HUGE CLOSE UP OF THE BUTTON with a
          terrible CLASHING of symbols!.
          Stephanie can't breathe.

</b>          Yeah, it was in my car. Hey, have
          you seen my Indian Head nickel? I
          put it in an envelope just like
          this one.
          Stephanie stares at the button, shaking her head in
          disbelief. The RUMBLING of the approaching train builds on

          of the platform.

          In her last moment of life, she turns her head to see...

</b>          Racing at her!
          Through the swirling smoke, the engine's mechanical face,
          resembles the goat like face of the demon Lamia.
          It VOMITS STEAM as it angrily bares down upon her.

          before. In every door creak... in every cold night wind... a
          haunting, soulless sound... the cry of Lamia.
          Ray races to the edge of the platform. The two lover's eyes
          find each other one last time.
          Stephanie SCREAMS as the Lamia swallows her and pulls her
          down into hell.

<b>          THE PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM
