</b><b>CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
</b>

<b>FADE IN:
</b>

<b>EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAY
</b>
A VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off.

<b>INT. VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAY
</b>
We move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regular
mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying
freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-
shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...

...a very nervous MAN.

Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.
We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then
we continue moving into --

<b>THE COACH SECTION
</b>
Stopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to
"VACANT" and...

<b>JAMES EARL JONES
</b>
(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of
description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones)
steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia:
multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the
works. He heads up the aisle towards --

<b>THE FIRST CLASS CABIN
</b>
Where he is stopped by a --

<b>                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>           I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is
           restricted to first cl...

Mr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET.

<b>                         JAMES EARL JONES
</b>           Is this what you're looking for?

She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just
handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes:

<b>                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>           Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there
           anything I can get you?

<b>                         JAMES EARL JONES
</b>           Scotch, blended. Straight.

He continues into the first class cabin and toward --
<b>
</b><b>CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              2.
</b>
<b>THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM
</b>
Where he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his
name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window.

After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and
leans, slightly, towards Jones.

<b>                        PASQUAL
</b>                 (tentatively)
          They say birds can't fly this high.

<b>                        JAMES EARL JONES
</b>          They say only angels can.

Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something
from his pocket when they are interrupted by --

<b>                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>          Shall I pour your scotch?

<b>                        JAMES EARL JONES
</b>          No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you.

She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off
the glass. She shrugs, leaving...

Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes
a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about
your end of the bargain?"

From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet
pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find
diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.

He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath
candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,
high-tech triggering mechanism.

<b>                        JAMES EARL JONES
</b>          Ah, c-5. The most dangerous
          explosive material ever invented.
          Hard to believe that this little
          contraption could blow up ten city
          blocks.

<b>                        PASQUAL
</b>          Be careful with it, huh?

Both men smile.   Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is
done.

Then suddenly, the lights blink out.

Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in-
flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a
torch.

</b><b>CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              3.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Columbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam
Sandler in "BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE."

James Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes.

<b>                           JAMES EARL JONES
</b>             Another movie from an old TV show?

<b>                           PASQUAL
</b>             Well, what're you gonna do?

<b>                               JAMES EARL JONES
</b>             Walk out.

<b>                           PASQUAL
</b>             That's very funny.

But James Earl Jones is dead serious.

<b>                               JAMES EARL JONES
</b>             No.   It isn't.

Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the
back of the plane, shouting:

<b>                            JAMES EARL JONES (CONT'D)
</b><b>             EVERYONE!   FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS!
</b>
Now Jones does the unthinkable. Holding Pasqual tight,
he yanks open the emergency door release.

With a RUSH, the cabin decompresses.

Panic erupts as air, paper and everything not belted in
screams out of the open door, including --

<b>EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - FALLING AWAY FROM THE 747 - DAY
</b>
-- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug.
They plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's
frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely.

<b>DROPPING WITH THEM
</b>
They continue to fall, gaining speed. Pasqual is
terrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried. In fact,
casually, he glances at his watch, and then looks --

<b>FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKY
</b>
At the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the
distance...
<b>
</b><b>CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               4.
</b>
<b>CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK
</b>
It's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps
out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the
sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards

<b>JONES AND PASQUAL
</b>
who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal
velocity. Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMS
and tries to clutch onto him, desperate.

<b>                        JAMES EARL JONES
</b>                 (over the rushing wind)
<b>          PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAVE
</b><b>          COMPANY.
</b><b>                        PASQUAL
</b><b>          WHAT?
</b>
Suddenly -- WHOMMPPPH!! -- the skydiver spread-eagles,
stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and
immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him.

All three are still free-falling.

James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the
helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman.

Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels.
She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale --
only she's playing for the good guys.

She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's
rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He
flies upward, leaving --

Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.    Below the
ocean screams up at them. Not much time left.

James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies
up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his
entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig.

Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute
unfurls, and now...

Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards --

<b>EXT. THE BIG BLUE SEA - DAY
</b>
A cigarette boat floats through the choppy water, a
gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling
<b>V-8.
</b>
Say hello to NATALIE THOMPSON, Charlie's second angel.
At a glance, she's the brainy-shy girl next door.

<b>                                                 (CONTINUED)

</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle, and she's
unstoppable.

Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under
Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off
her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake.

Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat
underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his
dashiki-chute, and then all three look up...

Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,
catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still
bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed
at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones.

<b>                           PASQUAL
</b>             You crazy bastard!

<b>                           JAMES EARL JONES
</b>             I think you mean crazy bitch.

With that, James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face
off. Latex rips free, and standing there (without his
dashiki, James Earl Jones has a great figure) is...

... stunningly beautiful DYLAN SANDERS, angel number
three. She's the wild one.

Pasqual's jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free, then
reaches in her mouth --

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>                    (still with James Earl Jones' voice)
             Don't need this anymore.

-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>                    (now in her real voice)
             But I sure could use this.

And she pulls from her pocket the airplane-size bottle of
Johnnie Walker Black. She twists it open and downs it.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Damn I hate to fly.

<b>EXT. BEACH DOCK - DAY
</b>
Now, MEN IN "FBI" WINDBREAKERS haul Pasqual away, two of
them carefully handling the certs-explosive. A harmless
fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock.

It's JOHN BOSLEY, Charlie's lieutenant.

</b>
He reaches the boat, which Natalie ties off while Alex
and Dylan neatly fold their parachutes.

<b>                           BOSLEY
</b>             Well, Angels, the experimental
             explosives are back in the hands of
             the government, and the free world
             can breathe just a lit-tle bit
             easier tonight, thanks to you three.

Alex, Natalie and Dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand,
each starting to unzip/unbutton/unsnap their action gear and
hand it to Bosley as they continue walking.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             And thanks to you, too, Bos.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             We couldn't have redirected the
             flight path without your help.

Bosley puffs, proud. He speaks over the ever-growing
pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki...

<b>                           BOSLEY
</b>             Nothing a little teamwork can't do.
             At least, that's what Charlie's
             always telling us, right ladies?

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>             Charlie will be joining us, won't he?

<b>                           BOSLEY
</b>             He sends his regrets. But he
             wanted you to know that dinner is
             on him, so feel free to celebrate.

By now, the Angels have stripped off all of their
equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             If it's on Charlie, we will.

The Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy
duds at a private beach club, where a WAITER greets them
with a tray of champagne flutes.

They each take a glass, turn to each other and raise
them. Another Angels Mystery... Case Closed.

FREEZE FRAME.    And the TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS...

<b>                           CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>             Once upon a time...

THREE FOURTH GRADE SCHOOL PHOTOS FILL THE FRAME, side by
side by side. These are three very different girls.

NATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic
schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit
awkward and gangly, even shy.

ALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is
sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten.

DYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded,
street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation
and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence.

<b>                           CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>             ... there were three very
             different little girls.

The triptych remains on screen.    Now it shifts into:

<b>VIDEO TAPE - THE THREE GIRLS (STILL IN TRIPTYCH)
</b>
Now TEENAGERS, on HOME VIDEO.

NATALIE, working the A-V equipment at school, hides her
face in embarrassment, uncomfortable with the camera.
<b>FREEZE.
</b>
ALEX, in riding gear, accepting her steeple-chase trophy.
She knows where to look for the camera. FREEZE.

DYLAN, smoking with her tough-girl friends in the girls'
room of her reform school, is caught on camera. She
flips it off. FREEZE.

<b>                           CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Who grew up into three very
             different women.

<b>TRIPTYCH CONTINUES
</b>
They're all WOMEN now, in their early twenties.

NATALIE, a research fellow at MIT (and beautiful, but not
flaunting it) demonstrates a chess-playing computer
program to a room of impressed advisors.

ALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her
address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents.

DYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She
sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend.
She decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar.

<b>                           CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>             With three things in common...
<b>
</b><b>CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              8.
</b>
<b>TRIPTYCH ENDS
</b>
With photographs again. The women, as they are now:
Natalie, Alex, Dylan. All gorgeous, all self-assured.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>           They're brilliant. They're
           beautiful. And they work for me.

Now, FIREBALL EXPLOSIONS completely fill the screen.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>           My name is Charlie.

ANGEL SILHOUETTES appear, in flames.    New MUSIC kicks in.

<b>                        "CHARLIE'S ANGELS"
</b>
...And a new title sequence takes over:

<b>VARIOUS SHOTS:   MONTAGE (OVER MUSIC)
</b>
Credits continue as we watch the Angels in action (from,
presumably, previous adventures...)

-- A microscope-peering Natalie cuts a ruby, drops it in
a laser housing, shoots a red beam.

--   Dylan, wielding kendo sticks, spars with two Yakzuza.

-- Alex side-kicks two baddies, spins, drops a third.
ZOOM BACK: she is at the Parthenon.

-- A motocross race. Natalie digs in for the finish,
attacking the last jump with gusto.

-- Dylan, in traditional Islamic robes, finds a secret
switch. She pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs.

-- At a ballroom dance competition, Alex wows the crowd
while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple.

-- Bosley, as "Luka, the Bad Ass Pimp," bitch-slaps a
couple of "ho's" -- actually Dylan and Alex -- then winks
at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off, scared.

--   Natalie bites into a messy hot-dog, has to just laugh.

-- The three angels elbow their way through a roller-
derby match.

-- In orange prison jumpsuits, Alex and Dylan work in
female chain-gang.

-- Window-washer Natalie peers into a skyscraper office,
surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
-- On an Italian street, the three Angels buy a paper,
grin at the headline, "Mystery Women Save European
Union." As they high-five, Dylan's cone of gelato drops
to the sidewalk. The Angels look at it, look at each
other...and just have to laugh.

<b>TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS.
</b>
OVER BLACK we hear a DIGITAL RING...

<b>INT. TINY HOUSEBOAT BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
CLOSE ON Dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly
sheets, disoriented and a bit hungover. She hears the
RINGING -- where is it coming from? Why is it drilling
into her head?

Checking the floor, she finds her jeans. Digs in the
pocket to find her cell phone. Answering...

<b>                            DYLAN
</b>             Hi.
                     (recognizing voice)
             Hi.   Okay. I'll be right in.

She clicks the phone off, then starts looking around.
Where the fuck is she?

From the next room, we hear a male VOICE singing "My
Sharona." She checks under the sheets. Oh God. She's
naked. She pulls her shirt from the floor, puts it on.
Closing her eyes, she prays...

<b>                            DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Not him.   Not him, not him, not him.

<b>                            DYLAN
</b>             Oh God no.

At the door, skinny shirtless CHAD holds a skillet of eggs.

<b>                            CHAD
</b>             Hungry?

<b>EXT. CHAD'S CRAPPY BOAT - DAY

Blinded by the daylight, Dylan emerges from below,
relieved to see the boat is docked. Chad follows her
outside, pleading...
<b>                         CHAD

</b>             Then how come we keep getting back
             together? It's fate.

Dylan just keeps walking.

<b>CLOSEUP - MAN'S FACE
</b>
This is Jason Gibbons, handsome, action-movie stud.       He's
concentrating fiercely.

<b>                           ALEX (O.S.)
</b>             If you don't defuse this bomb,
             Logan, L.A.'s going to be a new
             underwater attraction.

A bead of sweat drops down Jason's face.

<b>                           JASON
</b>             Get off my back, Sanchez.   I know
             what I'm doing.

REVEAL ALEX, her face right next to his.

<b>                            ALEX
</b>             Which wire?   The red one or the blue one?

<b>                           JASON
</b>             Marix has a thing for red. Red
             cars, red boats, red-headed hookers.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             So the red one.

<b>                           JASON
</b>             That's why I'm gonna say blue.

He makes a "snip" motion.     They both breathe a sigh of relief.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             You saved the world again, Logan.

She leans forward, closer and closer, right in his face.

it, but pulls away for a second.

ALEX and JASON are in a fully macked out Airstream,
sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. We
can tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal
Hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away
from home.

She licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again.

As she smiLes, a cell phone RINGS. Both Alex and Jason
reach for their phones. It's hers.

Jason stands in the doorway in his robe as Alex tosses
her stuff in the back of a very excellent car.

             I don't get it, what kind of

A burst of steam clears, revealing Bosley. He waddles forward
in his shower clogs, which SQUISH with every step. He's wearing
two towels: one around his waist, and a second around his
chest.

As more steam dissipates, we see there    are SEVEN MEN sitting on
the risers. Six are gorgeous, ranging     from Calvin Klein models
to Marlboro Men. Bosley looks around,     taking a keen interest.
Maybe he's checking them out, maybe he    isn't. We just don't
know.

The seventh man is ROGER CORWIN, who we recognize from
the videotape. He's leaning forward, a gold chain
dangling. It's beside him that Bosley takes a seat.

He sets the ice cup -- and the transmitter -- in a
strategic location.

Noticing that none of the other men have towels around
their bosoms, Bosley nervously undoes his, revealing skin
the color of cooked salmon. He fluffs up his sparse chest hair,
then decides to smush it back down.

He tries to make eye contact with Corwin, working way too
hard. Annoyed, Corwin finally looks over.

He sees another guy eating ice chips. Good idea.      Bosley

Picking a seat behind Bosley, he pulls off his towel as
he passes. We just see a bit of ass, but Bosley is face-
to-face with the babymaker.

One ice chip is not going to do it.    He chugs the rest of
his cup, including

<b>THE TRANSMITTER
</b>
which BLEEPS.    Corwin and others look over.    What the hell
was that?

The device still in his mouth, Bosley has no choice but to
smile and swallow. His eyes go wide as he chokes it down.

Corwin gets up to leave.

<b>                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Nice talking with you.

Another BLEEP. He shuts his mouth tight. Smiles. Rubs
his chest a bit, trying to get the transmitter down.

<b>INT. PRIVATE MASSAGE ROOM - DAY
</b>
Corwin walks into a lushly-appointed private massage
room. A masseuse dressed in a skimpy robe, her back to
us, oils up her hands sensuously near the window.

<b>                        MASSEUSE
</b>                 (German accent)
          Please to take off clothes, Mr. Corvin.

Corwin gets under the sheet, on his stomach. The
masseuse turns around, and now we see that it's Alex.

Alex starts to work on his back. She is clearly an
expert at this. This is a legit place, but there's
something undeniably sensual about the whole experience.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>          You're carrying a lot of tension
          along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae.
          Let me see if I can vork it out.

Under the table, we look up to see Corwin's face in the
cradle. He's in a tortured rapture.

Alex works along Corwin's back and neck.   She pulls his
arms out to the side.

<b>                        ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>          The human body is an amazing instrument.
          Just by activating ze right energy
          points, you can improve ze circulation,
          alleviate pain, or...

Corwin goes limp.

</b>                 (losing the accent)
          ... knock a man unconscious.

Confident Corwin is out cold, she slides the key strap
off his wrist.

<b>INT. EXECUTIVE LOCKER ROOM - DAY
</b>
Making sure she's alone, Alex uses the key to open a
locker. She carefully sorts through Corwin's things,
finding his Palm Pilot organizer. She clicks it into a
special device, which BLIPS as it downloads all his
information.

Putting the Palm Pilot away, she shuts the locker.

<b>INT. MASSAGE ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON Corwin as he suddenly wakes up, disoriented.

<b>INT. NATALIE'S EXCELLENT CONVERTIBLE - DAY
</b>
The Angels are all in the car together, cruising down
Sunset Boulevard. Dylan drives, Alex in the passenger seat,
Natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             Can you not drive my car so fast,
             Dyl? I'm trying to type.

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>                    (to Alex, under her breath)
             I drive too fast. Look who's talking.

She pulls into an In N' Out Burger, right up to the drive thru.

</b>             Three double doubles, animal style.
             Fries. Three chocolate shakes.

While they wait for their order, Natalie punches
something up on her computer.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             Here's Corwin's itinerary.

ONSCREEN -- we see a list of all Corwin's plans for the
next week. Two events in particular stand out:

<b>     TUESDAY NIGHT -- INVESTOR RECEPTION, BILTMORE HOTEL
</b>
<b>     THURSDAY -- SAN DIEGO RACEWAY
</b>
Dylan glances over the schedule.

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>             Alright, we'll hit the reception tonight.
             I only wish we had a clue to go on.

The food comes, Dylan takes it.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             Hold that thought.

Natalie goes back to the computer again, slipping a CD
into the drive. Dylan hands out the food, spilling a lot
of it. A big glop of chocolate shake lands on the
keyboard.

<b>                            NATALIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Uh, hello?   Expensive equipment.

<b>                              DYLAN
</b>             Sorry.

Natalie licks the shake off her fingers, tapes away at
the keyboard.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             Check this out. New program I just
             got from a friend in the Bureau. We
             take that footage from the kidnapping...

On screen, the footage downloads from the CD, into the
program. Natalie fast forwards through it until she
comes to a shot of one of the kidnappers where his mask
is partly pulled away from his face.

<b>                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
</b>             ... isolate the part of the suspect's
             face that's revealed, then retriangulate
             his bone structure...

The program zooms in on the revealed part of his face,
then runs a series of calculations. A new drawing starts
to appear.

<b>                              NATALIE (CONT'D)
</b>             ... and voila!     We've got a composite.

Natalie's portable printer spits out a simulated
composite of one skinny, bad-looking dude. Dylan grabs
it, looks it over.

<b>                          DYLAN
</b>             Sweet. Now we've got someone to
             look for.

She hands it to Alex to inspect.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot
             with that open head wound.

She turns the composite around, revealing that Dylan has
smudged his head with ketchup.

They all just have to laugh.

<b>INT. BILTMORE BALLROOM - DAY
</b>
A sophisticated reception is in full swing, an ocean of
smart suits and power ties.

Dressed as a catering waitress, Natalie carries a tray of
hors d'oeuvres. MOVING WITH her, we pass ROGER CORWIN, who
talks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively-
dressed DYLAN who chats up a group of WALL STREET TYPES.

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>             The average investor sees technology
             stocks as discrete entities, "This one is
             up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's
             only through derivative analysis that one
             sees the real power of that sector.

A few nods.    She makes a good point.

<b>                           BROKER GUY
</b>             Which analysis method do you prefer?

On Dylan.    Shit.     She tries to stall...

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>             Well, there are so many options.
             I mean, who can say what the one
             best choice is?

<b>ACROSS THE ROOM
</b>
Still walking, Natalie talks to no one...

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             Keppler-Wilson.

<b>BACK WITH DYLAN
</b>
<b>                            DYLAN
</b>             For my money, Keppler-Wilson is a
             strong choice.

More nods, ad-libbed agreement.        The Broker Guy is impressed.

Excusing herself, Dylan turns and subtly touches her ear,
where she's wearing a hidden radio.

<b>                             DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Thanks.

She didn't realize he was so close.

             Anytime, day or night, I am... excited
             ... to be handing out champagne.

Oh God.   What did she just say?       But he smiles anyway.

She heads back out into the crowd.       You can almost see
the big L on her forehead.

<b>BY THE FOUNTAIN

Dylan has been watching this.        We INTERCUT between her
and Natalie.

<b>                             DYLAN
</b>             He's cute.

<b>                             NATALIE

</b>             He's a bartender. I need dependable.
             I need reliable. I need a Volvo man.

Natalie walks past Dylan, not acknowledging her.        Dylan
snaps her fingers.

<b>                             NATALIE
</b>             Miss!   Miss!   I'd love some champagne.

Natalie comes back, a little annoyed. Dylan takes a
glass for herself, then foists the other glasses on
everyone around her, whether they wanted it or not.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)

She nudges Natalie in that direction.

suddenly realizes Natalie is waiting for him.

She smiles, hearing the deal close. Pushing through a
cluster of investors, she bumps into a THIN MAN.

<b>                            DYLAN
</b>             Pardon me.

He doesn't respond, but something about this man raises

moves out of earshot...

             Vegetarian spring roll?

He waves her away, no. Oops, she drops a napkin in front
of him. She kneels down to get it.

As we move in VERY CLOSE ON her tray, we see that there's
a tiny Digital display. A metal detector is built into
the rim.

It BLIPS as she moves past his ankle. And again as she
rises up past his chest. The man just keeps walking.

The Thin Man comes around the corner.       We stay TIGHT on
him, until he suddenly stops.

<b>NATALIE

has come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts
tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in.

And then, a DING!

Elevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue-
less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones.
In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the
hallway and takes his place. Hits the button.

From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the
elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the
panel.

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>             He's going down.

They take the stairs.

Natalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the
elevator empty. To the left, exit doors swing tellingly.

<b>EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

Nat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into
the sun-drenched streets of beautiful, downtown Los
Angeles. Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man, booking
down the alley.

And they take off after him.

What ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one
guy foot chase you've ever seen. Here are some highlights:

-- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link
fence. Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick
and run up the side wall and hop over easily.

-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow,
then darts across the Harbor Freeway. By the time Dylan
and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again.
Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and
rolling under the wheels of a moving semi.

-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling
at her. She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives
underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts.

-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat.
The scene goes something like this:

<b>INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY ROOM
</b>
Thunderously LOUD, with industrial washers and dryers operating
at full tilt. Natalie and Dylan are just entering when

<b>THREE SHOTS

ring out.    They dive for cover behind a massive washer
assembly.

</b>             Where's the challenge in that?

ANGLE ON the Thin Man, planning his next move. With no
good shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns BLAZING.
He shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a
cascade of hot water.

Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded.

Other pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure, leading
to an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an
inch of water grows on the floor.

Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin
Man's direction. He shoots at them, but quickly realizes
they're just trying to waste his bullets.

Holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone.

On the far wall, Natalie switches on the overhead hooks,
which circle on a wire like a ski lift. The Thin Man
looks up, distracted, not noticing --

<b>DYLAN
</b>
As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry
carts. She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man
as he talks on the phone.

She clears her throat.      The Thin Man turns.   She kicks
him in the jaw.

Knocked back, he drops the phone, which CRACKS and slips
under a washing machine.

He crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet.
We weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy.

<b>HE TURNS TO SEE
</b>
<b>NATALIE
</b>
right behind him. With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun
arm and expertly flips him. But he reacts smoothly, rolling
over to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of
potatoes. As he does, he grabs her right in the tit.

<b>                             NATALIE
</b>             Hey!    Hands off, assh....

Before she can finish her sentence, the Thin Man throws
Natalie at Dylan, knocking them both down. He jumps up,
and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks
another, releasing a wall of steam -- we can't see a thing.

By the time the fog clears, the Thin Man is long gone.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             Okay, to summarize? Damn.

Lying down in the water, Dylan reaches under the washer
to fish out the Thin Man's busted cell phone.

<b>INT. TOWNSEND AGENCY BACK ROOM - DAY
</b>
Natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor, the Thin
Man's cell phone connected by a data cable to the
Townsend Agency computers. Rapidly touching the screen,
she calls up a list of the last thirty-five phone calls
he received. They're all from the same location.

<b>                            BOSLEY
</b>             Well.   That was easy.

A rowdy establishment just outside of town.

</b>
The kind of place that rich weekend skiers don't come.
Lots of over-aggressive, cowboy-biker types, drinking more
than they should. There are only a few women in the place,
and they are either waitresses or biker chicks. Suddenly,
everyone stops what they're doing and turns to the door.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS have entered the room. Dressed in their
stylish ensembles, they couldn't possibly look more out of

She points to a door at the back of the bar that leads
into a glassed-in office. Two, beefy bouncer types are guarding
the door.

</b>             I think that can be arranged.

The Three Angels split up, Bosley tagging along with Dylan.

sidles up to the bar. A group of three rednecks are
downing shots, one after another.

one.

</b>             Ooh, that is an enticing offer.
             But I got a better idea. How

The three rednecks hoot and holler.

REVEAL that two of the rednecks are down for the count, one
falling out of his chair, the other passed out on the table.

The third redneck is slurring badly, trying to keep up
with Dylan.

Dylan and Natalie create a distraction, while Alex sneaks
into the back office with Bosley to get the phone number
of the chalet.

A VW van climbs the winding road.       As we get closer, we see the
side reads, "Chalet Grams."

A DING-DONG DING-DING-DONG doorbell rings.

TWO THUGS with shoulder holsters look up, hearing the bell.

Checking his gun, Thug One grabs for his windbreaker.
Puts it on over.

<b>EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Thug One opens the door to find Dylan and Natalie dressed
in Swiss Miss outfits, complete with blonde braids.

<b>                           DYLAN

</b>                    (to each other)
             Guten Freund!

The girls lean in and hug each other, butts sticking out.
To the left, Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa
OOMMPA on a wrap-around tuba. He's wearing lederhosen,
with a feather in his hat.

Natalie begins to YODEL.

Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug
Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is
going on.

Dylan begins to TALK-SING a song in German about a too-
curious goat and his worried mistress. Even with the pantomime,
we have no idea what's happening. It seems
wholesome, but occasionally one of the girls touches the
other in a weirdly coquettish, oddly sexual way.

Thug Two looks at the address on the envelope.

</b>
<b>EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT
</b>
... where a black cat-suited Alex stands at the
chimney... A ribbon of smoke curls from the stack.

Pulling the pin from a canister, she drops it down the
chimney.

<b>INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE GREAT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A cheerful fire burns in the over-sized fireplace. The
canister drops into the flames from above, suddenly
venting a HISSING cloud of halon gas. The fire dies
immediately, the logs covered with a violent frost.

<b>INT. THE CHIMNEY - NIGHT
</b>
Alex doesn't even need a rope. Her feet pressed to the
sooty walls, she expertly slides to the bottom.

<b>INT. GREAT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Alex backs out of the fireplace to find a WAITING BAD GUY
swinging

<b>A FIREPLACE POKER
</b>
at her head. She ducks just in time.     The poker CHINGS
against the stone, making a spark.

Rolling, jumping and diving, Alex scurries as Pokerman
slashes and stabs. She ducks behind a chair, which
Pokerman catches with the hook, winging it across the
room.

Backed against the wall, Alex yanks on the heavy
curtains, pulling them down, along with the wooden
curtain rod. A spin, a flourish of velvet and the
curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty
quarterstaff.

She goes on the offensive.    Thrust, parry, spin.

But he's a worthy adversary. One good karate kick breaks
her staff in two. She uses both pieces to club him in
the knees, then rolls back to the fireplace.

She grabs the remaining tool: the fireplace tongs.
Pokerman swings. Alex catches his weapon in the tong
scissors, yanking it free with such force the point sticks
in the wall.

A quick kick knocks Pokerman to the floor, where Alex
rolls on top of him. She catches his head in the tongs,
squeezing his temples. His eyes bulge.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>          Where's Knox?

<b>INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Young billionaire ERIC KNOX paces. He's grungy, with
two days of stubble, but still a darn attractive guy.

Hearing a KICK at the door, he turns.

A second KICK blows the door open.     It's Alex.

<b>                           KNOX
</b>          Who are you?

<b>                           ALEX
</b>          The calvary.     Giddy up.

<b>EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
</b>
Bosley is about to hyper-ventilate on the tuba, sweaty
and a little blue.

Dylan and Natalie's new song has them sharing the saddle
of an imaginary horse. When Dylan reaches back to slap
the "horse," she hits Natalie in the rump. Both women
tee-hee.

The thugs think it's pretty hot.

Dylan whispers a secret to Natalie.     Natalie WHISPERS
back.

Turning to the thugs, they each lean in to WHISPER into
a different thug's ear. As the men smile, the angels
suddenly BONK the two men's heads together. Both men
fall, knocked out.

Stepping over the bodies, Dylan heads inside.

<b>INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Looking for the way out, Alex leads Knox to a closed
door. She opens it to find...

<b>INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
... TWO MORE THUGS sitting in front the big-screen TV,
watching a college basketball game (Duke vs. Maryland,
in case you care.) The guards look back, spotting Alex
with Knox.

That wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the

<b>FIFTEEN OTHER THUGS
</b>
watching the game with them.

ANGLE ON Alex.   It's an oh-shit moment.

The thugs are out of their seats a moment later, each of
them pulling out a firearm.

<b>EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Holding down three keys on the tuba, Bosley talks into
the mouthpiece. It has a secret radio.

<b>                           BOSLEY
</b>             Alex, what's your status?

<b>INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Running, Alex pushes Knox ahead of her, checking their
backs. She talks into a wrist-mic.

<b>                            ALEX
</b>             Good news:   I found Knox.

Another THUG steps out in front of her.      She kicks him
down the steps.

<b>                             ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>             Bad news:    I found company.

Reaching the bottom of the steps, Knox is surprised to be
grabbed by Dylan.

<b>                             DYLAN
</b>             This way.

At this point, he'll do whatever they say.

<b>EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Dylan rushes Knox across the driveway to the waiting van
-- Natalie is pulling it around. Overhead, bright
security lights switch on.

Back at the front door, Alex pulls it shut. She attaches
a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord
from it around the porch column.

<b>INT. FOYER - NIGHT

The first of the thugs reaches the door, tries to pull it
open but can't. The next few guards try to help him,
while the rest start smashing through the windows.

<b>EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Running with the tuba, Bosley stops for a moment to catch
his breath, hands on his knees. Okay, ready to run
again.

He's the last to be pulled into the van.    A spray of
gravel and they're off.

<b>INT. THE VAN - NIGHT
</b>
Everyone is piled on top of each other. Dylan and Knox
have a few awkward moments as they get untangled. Bosley
keeps making inappropriate TUBA NOISES.

At the wheel, Natalie is fierce and focused, in total
control.

Looking out the back windows, Alex sees the kidnappers
piling into jeeps to give chase. From the side of the
house, more thugs appear on motorbikes.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>          They're coming after us.

<b>                        DYLAN

          We were expecting that.

<b>                        NATALIE
</b>          Okay, new problem.

Everyone's attention WHIPS FORWARD to see the headlights of

<b>GIANT LOGGING TRUCK
</b>
coming up the high mountain road. It straddles the
center line, blocking both directions. There's no way
around it.

</b>
She points to a faded "CLOSED" sign that hangs from a
chain. In the darkness, who knows what it's blocking.
But as we hear the THUNDEROUS HORN from the oncoming
truck, we know there's no choice.

Natalie cuts a hard right, SMASHING through the sign.

The van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass,
its headlights only showing ten feet ahead. At any
moment, the ground could stop in a cliff.

Like now.

The van leaps into empty space.      Tires spin, helpless.
The van falls.

Everyone SCREAMS.    Bosley is the loudest.

And then, touchdown. The van hits the ground, hard but
not catastrophically. Natalie hits the brakes, cuts the
wheel hard to avoid hitting

<b>A CONCRETE WALL
</b>
in front of them.    Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge
they're alive.

<b>                             DYLAN

Suddenly, a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead.

<b>EXT. THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

One by one, a series of arc lights switches on, forming a
snake all the way to the bottom of the mountain.

<b>INT. THE VAN - NIGHT
</b>
Looking out the back windows...

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             It's a bobsled run.

They're facing backwards.

Up ahead, the kidnappers are charging down the access roads.
The first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             If it goes down the mountain,
             that's all I need.

Throwing it into reverse, Natalie peels out.

The jeeps follow.

</b>
<b>EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT
</b>
The VW Van leads the way down the mountain, tail-first.
As it builds speed, it starts to climb the wall, each turn
getting steeper and steeper.

The two jeeps are following. Facing the right direction,
they have a much easier time of it.

<b>INT. VAN - NIGHT
</b>
Everything is shaking so violently, it looks like a NASA launch.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                  (looking out the back)
           Hard left! HARD LEFT!

Natalie makes the turn. The van rises up, nearly tilting
over. But they make it through the turn.

<b>                         KNOX
</b>                  (to Dylan)
           Is this part of the plan?

<b>                         DYLAN
</b>           Yes. Except for the bobsled run,
           and the backwards part, it's
           going exactly according to plan.

A beat.   He smiles at her.   He has a nice smile.

<b>EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT
</b>
One of the jeeps makes a move, closing the distance to
the van. A RIFLEMAN leans out the passenger window,
lining up a shot. He FIRES.

<b>INT. THE VAN - NIGHT
</b>
The shot blasts cleanly through the top of the windshield,
through the horn of Bosley's tuba, then out the back window.   It
missed hitting somebody by millimeters.

Natalie is still focused, making each turn as Alex calls it.

<b>EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT`
</b>
The front jeep gets even more aggressive, building speed.

It hits the next turn too fast, rising up too high along
the wall. It tips further, and further, finally rolling
over onto its back. It SCRAPES across the concrete, a
shower of sparks as it slows down.

With nowhere to go, the second jeep brakes hard, but can't stop.
It SMASHES into the first jeep, a tangle of steel.

farther and farther away.

Just then, two MOTORBIKES race up along the chute walls, passing
the crippled jeeps. Two more MOTORBIKES jump in from above.

One motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the
windshield. Natalie taps on the brakes. The freaked out
guy can't slow down in time. He SMACKS into the windshield,
then goes flying.

Indeed, we are. The concrete walls end, leaving open ground.
Slamming on the brakes, Natalie turns the van around.
Everyone goes flying. Bosley is still on the phone with
Charlie.

Back facing the right direction, the van charges onward.
The motorcycles race up to the passenger side, grabbing
for the door.

Dylan SLAMS open the door, knocking one RIDER off.

The sliding door opens, another RIDER outside trying to get
in. Thinking fast, Knox grabs Bosley's tuba and shoves it
at the motorcyclist, who tumbles, taking out the fourth
rider in the process.

             screw up our IPO. They also stole
             the proprietary software for our new

<b>EXT. SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY - DAY
</b>
With a ROAR, another blur of racers whips past, with heat
and noise and speed. The lead car bears the familiar
markings of RED STAR INDUSTRIES. Roger Corwin is at the
wheel, steering calmly to a comfortable lead, when he is
suddenly BUMPED.

ANOTHER BUMP sends him screeching to the left. He almost
crashes, then gets back on course, just as he's passed by...

A SLEEK, BLACK CAR, sponsored by the SONY CORPORATION, and
manned by a mysterious driver with TEXAS TORNADO inscripted on
the helmet. We follow the black car as it pulls into the pit.

The racer pulls off her helmet as the pit crew surrounds her.
Of course, the racer is Natalie, aka BETTY LOU HOBERT, the Texas
Tornado.

Natalie shakes out her hair, winks at the pit boss.

The Pit Crew races in to make repairs. DYLAN, dressed in a
pit suit, kneels by Natalie's front tire. Natalie crouches
down next to her so they can talk.

<b>                           NATALIE (CONT'D)

Dylan steals away, heading for...

Corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit.

</b><b>             LET'S GO!    WE'RE LOSING TIME HERE!

The pit repairs his car as Corwin is approached by another
racer, also wearing a Red Star racing suit. He leans into
Corwin's car and now we see that's it's... THE THIN MAN.

The Thin Man peers over at Natalie, but she's got her
back to him.

</b>             Yeah.   You do that.

Corwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing
the Thin Man in the process.

<b>AS CORWIN PULLS OUT
</b>
Dylan sneaks in. In all the cacophony, no one notices
as she grabs CORWIN'S SUITCASE out of the back seat of
his regular car, a bitching Mercedes. She checks both
ways to see if she's being watched.

<b>                           BOSLEY (O.S.)

Where Alex, dressed as a trophy girl, watches the race
through binoculars and keeps an eye on her pals. She
nods to BOSLEY, who is dressed as the Flag Waver. He
speaks into a walkie talkie.

<b>BACK IN THE PIT --
</b>
Dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit, and swaps
it with one in Corwin's car. She carefully switches all
his files from the old briefcase to the new one, then
gives Alex a thumbs up.

<b>MEANWHILE BACK IN THE RACE --
</b>
NATALIE roars back onto the track, keeping Corwin in her
sights. Then she spots another Red Star car, coming up
right next to her. She locks eyes with the Thin Man.

The two of them recognize each other at the exact same
instant.

The Thin Man, realizing he's been made, jams on the
brakes and skids off to the right, which leads to a ramp
that heads out of the stadium.

Natalie, not wanting to lose him, does something crazy.
Even though she's at the front of the pack, she brakes
hard, swerves into a full 180 degree U-turn, and starts
heading the WRONG WAY on the race track.

Startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she
follows the Thin Man out of the racetrack.

<b>EXT. SPEEDWAY ACCESS ROAD - DAY
</b>
To a chorus of CAR HORNS, the Thin Man's blue racer weaves
through the spectator traffic entering the speedway.

Looking back, we see Natalie is gaining on him.

Finally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip.

</b>             If you're just joining us, we're
             approaching hour five of a pursuit
             that has lead us all across the
             Southland, at speeds up to 80
             miles an hour.

A beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars
down the empty freeway. It's oddly calm and hypnotizing.

<b>                           FEMALE ANCHOR VOICE
</b>             Chuck, time and again we hear the
             question, "Why don't the police just
             ram the other car, or shoot out the
             tires?" The LAPD has a policy of
             hanging back and following unless...

Suddenly, the blue Formula One car comes screeching past
the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour.

As she passes the police cars, we see several OFFICERS
look over -- what the hell?

Natalie catches up to the gray Chrysler. Looks over to
see the WILD-EYED SUSPECT, hunched over the wheel.

He looks back at her. A beat later, she's passed him,
just taillights on the freeway.

<b>EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
With the lanes cleared for the other chase, there is
nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top
speed -- which they do.

Natalie is catching up to the Thin Man.

As they head under an overpass, we see KIDS CHEERING.

<b>INT. BLUE CAR - DAY
</b>
The Thin Man checks his gauges. The gas dial is perilously
close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often.

Up ahead, he sees an exit.   He starts to slow down...

<b>EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
... but when you're going 200 miles per hour, that can
take a while. He misses the exit.

Natalie is trying to match his speed.

The Thin Man pulls over to the side, stops fully.
Braking as hard as she can, Natalie still passes him.

The Thin Man throws a U-turn, heading up the freeway on-ramp.

Natalie follows.

<b>EXT. SAN DIEGO SHIPYARD - DAY
</b>
We catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars --
the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads, like
lions pacing.

<b>INT. NATALIE'S RED CAR - DAY

Pulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for
the blue car -- she's lost sight of him. The narrow
windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier.

We LOOK DOWN on Natalie's car as she rounds a corner,
still searching.

<b>EXT. PIER - DAY
</b>
Natalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the
long pier. It pulls a U-turn to face her, then stops,
engine idling. There's only way off the pier, and it's
past Natalie.

The Thin Man REVS his engine.

Natalie REVS hers.

ANGLE ON a white seagull, pecking at something on the
pier, halfway between the two racers. The bird looks up,
hearing the engines.

ANGLE ON the Thin Man. He pulls his harness tighter.
REVS his engine higher.

ANGLE ON Natalie. If it's a game of chicken he wants,
she'll give it to him. She REVS her engine higher still.

The noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off. Like
a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers
to peel out.

A cloud of SMOKE.    Rubber on asphalt.

Already reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a
collision course. The Thin Man isn't going to turn away.
Neither is Natalie.

Racing faster, and faster still, there's only one way
this can turn out. But then, at the very last moment,
the Thin Man wusses out. He cuts the wheel right,
missing Natalie and careening off the edge of the pier.

In SLOW MOTION, we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air,
wheels still spinning. Back-heavy, the tail hits the
water first.

Natalie brakes hard, cuts the wheel to avoid going off
the far end of the pier. She finally stops, the rear
tire just 1/4 inch from the edge.

CRANING UP along the side of the pier, we find Natalie
looking into the water where the blue racer went in.
There's just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles.

seated herself close to Natalie. So close, in fact, that
Natalie keeps having to shift a few inches.

Dylan, meanwhile, sits across the room from Knox,
deliberately avoiding eye contact.

</b>             Exactly. But they have heavy firewalls

             Pervasive video surveillance, lasers,
             air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard-

the laptop into a steel briefcase, then stands.

<b>INT. PARKING GARAGE / BEVERLY HILLS - DAY
</b>
Bosley hums "In the Navy" to himself as he walks through
a parking garage. He's alone in the echo-y garage, and
everything we know about movies tells us This Means Trouble.

BWEEP BWEEP as his alarm shuts off. Just as he's about
to lift the handle, he stops. Looks back over his shoulder.

Did he hear something? He scans the empty garage.         No
one in sight. Must've been his imagination.

<b>INT. BOSLEY'S MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
Bosley climbs in, shutting the door behind him.        He's
putting the keys in the ignition, when...

A HAND clamps a chloroformed rag over his mouth. It's
the Thin Man. Bosley struggles, but in moments, he's
unconscious.

that we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is

at the hole. That's strange.

Two more little explosions, these barely missing her face.

Suddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with
SILENCED GUNFIRE. It's only Alex's instincts that let
her duck in time to avoid being turned into Swiss cheese.

She tucks and rolls behind a Styrofoam set as...

TWO GUNMEN with silenced SNIPER rifles fan out on the
fake city street.

<b>ON ALEX --

crouched behind a wall.

She looks both ways. If she tries to break for the open
loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to Jason.
Only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the
way across the building, where there's a fire exit.

Taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.

<b>THE GUNMEN
</b>
fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going
to machine gun mode. The sound of the gunshots are covered
by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside.

<b>ALEX --

Sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams.
She lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the
two-by-fours in half.

<b>THE GUNMEN

move slowly through the fake street set. Suddenly, they
hear a creaking sound. They look up to see the whole,
fake building set collapsing!

They dive out of the way, just in time to see Alex race
through the fire doors.

her, just as she gets the car started. She peels out as
a hail of gunfire just misses her windshield.

<b>EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SOUNDSTAGE

Jason has just gotten his squibs refitted. He's facing
the opposite direction, so he doesn't see Alex's car
whizz away in the background.

Natalie shuts the door behind herself, then sets to work

The door swings back, SMASHING into his right hand.     He
drops the gun, looking up to see

with her foot.

Grabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic
swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls
into the next row of stalls.

Natalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles.
He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over.
That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts.

With a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled
up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe.

Dylan and Knox walk hand in hand up a quaint, woodsy path
behind Knox's home. We can hear music drifting up from
the hill in front of them.

He helps her up a steep part of the path.       As she comes
over the crest of a hill.

<b>DYLAN'S POV --
</b>
The hill behind Knox's house has a magnificent view right
into the Hollywood Bowl. The music is the symphony
playing something very romantic.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             That's amazing.

They stand there, together, just listening to the music,
Knox watching her reaction closely.

</b>             Can I ask you a personal question?

Dylan and Knox are asleep in his bed, when the doorbell
CHIMES. Dylan bolts upright. She slips out of bed, peers
out the window. Vivian Wu is waiting by the front door.

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>             Eric, it's Vivian.

Knox pulls on a robe, goes downstairs.

races the car even harder.

<b>INT. KNOX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Knox is sitting at the coffee table, signing papers. Vivian,
sitting across from him, has her cell phone open. They are
both surprised to see Dylan walk into the room.

Although Knox is clueless, it's clear the message Vivian
is sending to Dylan. She's in control here.

Vivian sets the gun on the table, in easy reach.

<b>                           KNOX
</b>                    (explaining)
             Vivian just came over to run through
             some numbers for the IPO.

<b>                           VIVIAN WU
</b>             Please, take a seat. I'm almost
             finished.

With a knowing glance at Dylan, she goes back to her
phone call.

No alternative, Dylan takes a seat beside Knox.     Both face
Vivian, whose hand is very near the gun.

Dylan looks at Knox as he reads through his papers.    He has no
idea there's anything wrong.

<b>                           VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
</b>                    (on phone)
             Really. How disappointing.

Vivian gestures to the abandoned Scrabble game on the table.
Why not play?

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>             I'm not much for games.

<b>                            VIVIAN WU
</b>             Pity.

As Knox flips pages in the report, Dylan casually begins
pushing Scrabble letters around, nothing serious. But she's
managed to spell...

<b>ENEMY
</b>
She gets Knox's attention, looks to the word, up to Vivian.
Knox follows her intention, but doesn't seem to believe it.

While Vivian continues to talk on the phone, Knox sets his
report down. Pushes around some letters of his own. The
words finally come out as...

<b>I   KNOW
</b>
CLOSE ON Dylan.      What does that mean?

Vivian snaps her phone shut.

Dylan stands up.    What the hell is going on?

Vivian draws the gun on her.    Knox moves over toward
Vivian's side.

<b>                           KNOX
</b>             Sorry Dylan. I knew this moment
             would come sooner or later. I was
             just hoping for later.

A long beat, Dylan trying to wrap her head around this.

<b>                           DYLAN

</b>             Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot
             better about you being a lying pole
             smoker.

Dylan looks like she's about to leap forward and tear Knox's
throat out. Vivian gestures for Dylan to keep stepping back.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)

How right he is, because as soon as Vivian squeezes the
trigger...

Dylan drops to the floor, then rolls.

<b>BLAM!
</b>
the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window
causing a spider-web crack to spread. Dylan sees her
opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian
pumps off shots.

As she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and
does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the
bullet impacted.

<b>SMASH!

The bulletproof glass shatters outward, and Dylan flies out
the window, onto the ledge.

             I've tried all his numbers and paged
             him five times. No answer.

                    (she pauses)
             What IS that?

There's a very faint voice coming from Bosley's desk drawer.
Dylan walks around the desk, yanks it open...

<b>                            BOSLEY (O.S.)
</b>             Angels!   Angels, can you hear me!

Dylan grabs the radio receiver from the drawer, holds him up.
Bosley's voice gets louder.

<b>                           BOSLEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>             I don't know if you can hear me. I don't
             know if this thing is even working.

The Angels crowd around Dylan and the receiver.     It seems
impossible.

On the top of the TV, a wire runs from the satellite feed to --

that Bosley swallowed at the spa.   It's worked its way
through his system.

The bird Bosley was whistling to lands on the TV, looks
at the transmitter, curious. SINGS its song.

She whips around to see the Thin Man, standing right
behind her. She instantly swings at him, he blocks it.
She's about to swing again when five guns get cocked
against her temple. She's surrounded by guards.

The thin man and his boys lead Dylan into the house.

tiny camera concealed there.

He flips shut a suitcase filled with C-5 explosive, the
same stuff we saw Pascal selling in the opening scene.

<b>                           DYLAN

</b>             No, just leaving myself plenty of
             margin for error. Goodbye, Dylan.

With that, he walks out of the room.

The Thin Man signals to the Henchmen. Two of them force
Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs.

Then, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her
arms to the arms of the chair. As they do:

<b>                           DYLAN

             first.
                    (whispering)
             It's gonna be the guy behind me.

The Thin Man can't help but be amused. After all, there
are six guards and one blonde -- who is now taped to a
chair.

<b>INT. TOWER OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Natalie keeps checking the shelves, looking for a secret
switch.

<b>                          NATALIE
</b>           I did. I do.    I mean, thank you
           for calling.

<b>INTERCUT
</b>
<b>                         PETE
</b>           I'm not an insecure person or anything,
           and I've really enjoyed the very brief
           time we have spent together.

Two GOONS race up the stairs into the office.   Natalie
turns to face them.

<b>                         PETE (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm just wondering if it's
           something I said or did that's
           making this whole thing so weird
           between us.

The Goons approach.

<b>                         NATALIE
</b>                  (into phone)
           Can you hold on a sec?

Hitting MUTE, Natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives
under the desk. She comes up on the other side with a

<b>SURGE SUPPRESSOR,
</b>
electric cords attached. She backhands it into the
goons, who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through
their bodies.

<b>                         NATALIE (CONT'D)
</b>                  (un-muting)
           One more sec.

She re-mutes.

With a roundhouse kick, she flattens one of the goons,
WHACKS the other with the cell phone.

The first goon charges at her, but she sidesteps at the
last moment, leaving Goon One to hit Goon Two. Both men
topple through the open window, falling. Yikes.

<b>                         NATALIE (CONT'D)

</b>             No.   Not at all.

She starts searching again for the switch.

<b>                           PETE
</b>             You just sound distracted.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             You know, work this week has been
             really busy. It's been hard to focus.

BEHIND NATALIE, Vivian Wu reaches the top of the stairs.
She moves stealthily. Natalie has no idea she's there.

<b>                           NATALIE (CONT'D)
</b>             See, the thing is, I'm not a full-
             time waitress. I should have been
             more up-front about that, it's just...

At the last moment, Natalie catches a moving reflection
in a shiny trophy. Turns to find Vivian Wu swinging an
antique chair at her head.

She ducks.    The chair SHATTERS the display case.

Scrambling to get away, Natalie drops the phone.

<b>                           PETE
</b>             Natalie, what was that?

<b>                           NATALIE

<b>                           VIVIAN WU
</b>             Hate to disagree.

Vivian upends the desk, nearly crushing Natalie. Vivian
jumps on top, ready to kick the shit out of our angel.

As we probably suspected, Vivian Wu is one hell of a
martial artist. Fortunately, so is Natalie.

In their first series of blows, Vivian seems to have the
upper hand, but Natalie rallies hard. Vivian surprises
her with a floor-sweeping kick, knocking her down.

Vivian grabs the phone off the floor.

<b>                           VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
</b>             Is this the famous Charlie?

             No, it's Pete.

Vivian looks at the phone. Who the fuck cares?      She
throws the phone out the open window.

Getting up, Natalie stares her down, incredulity building
to rage.

<b>                            NATALIE
</b>             You bitch!   I like that guy.

Mocking, Vivian wipes away a tear.

Natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full-out Mortal
Kombat. Vivian is thrown back against the bookcase,
where she knocks over a candlestick.

That's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking
into the floor. Circling around the room, each set of
shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that
lead to the upstairs room.

As Natalie and Vivian continue to fight, Bosley sticks
his head down from above, watching the brawl. Natalie is
kicking ass.

<b>                           NATALIE (CONT'D)

             Do you have any idea how difficult it
             is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?

She slams Vivian into the wall.      Grabs her again, hands
around her head.

<b>                             VIVIAN WU
</b>             To be honest?

Vivian suddenly leans forward and KISSES her, right on
the lips.

<b>                             VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
</b>             I don't care.

Natalie is surprised for a moment, which gives Vivian the
chance to swing at her. She misses.

<b>                           NATALIE
</b>             I can handle villainy. I can even
             handle super-villainy.
                    (Vivian swings and
                     misses again)
             But what you did is just wrong.

She head-butts Vivian, knocking her out cold.   She throws
the limp body on the floor.

A beat, then Natalie looks up to see Bosley.

He waves.

<b>EXT. VERANDAH - DAY
</b>
From below, we hear SECURITY WHISTLES. The compound has been
breached. Dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her.

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>             Here we go.

And now she does exactly what she told the Thin Man she'd do:

She pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back
crashes into the railing, tearing it off. She stands.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Okay, that part worked.

The Guards FIRE -- but Dylan has already launched herself
from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on
the head of --

Fat Boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the
chair into kindling. She grabs the wooden seat and whips
it up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it
like a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin.

Quickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Now, guys, I warned you. This is
             where you shoot each other.

The two men scoff, disbelieving. Then Dylan does a head
fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving
each man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall.

Just Guards #5 and 6 left.    Dylan's chair arms are still
taped to her forearms.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Okay, here's where we improvise.

In a whirl, she overhead-chops Guard #5. Drives her
right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm
into the back of the Guard #6's head.

A few more blows, then both men fall.

Now Dylan drops into a second chair, half-exhausted,
half-amused with herself. Has one brief beat to take it
all in, then --

Bosley steps onto the veranda, sees Dylan sitting in the
chair.

FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW: It looks like Dylan -- whose
arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair --
is taped to the chair she now sits in.

<b>                           BOSLEY
</b>             Oh my God, let me help you.

Bosley hurries over, "freeing her." Amused, Dylan lets
him. Natalie steps out from inside, pausing to KICK one
guard who was starting to revive.

his way into the courtyard.

</b>             Alex?!   Jesus, what is going on?

The Thin Man and Alex turn around to face Jason, who is
sweaty and exasperated from chasing her.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             Jason, hi, I...

The Thin Man digs the gun deeper into her back.

<b>                           ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>             Can I talk to you later?

<b>                           JASON
</b>             No you can talk to me NOW. I want
             to know what the hell is going on.
             First, you disappear with no
             explanation, not even a goodbye.

<b>                           ALEX

<b>                           JASON
</b>             Now, I see you here, but you're
             with some other guy.

<b>                           THIN MAN
</b>             Hey, movie star, do yourself a
             favor and get lost.

Jason double takes.     He's not used to someone talking to
him like that.

<b>                            JASON
</b>             Lemme guess.   You must be Charlie?

</b>             No, no I'm sick of this shit. I'm
             sick of this asshole telling you
             what you can and can't do.

And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the
Thin Man.

Now, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super
detective, so his punch isn't all that great. In fact, it
leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain.

The Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles.

<b>                           THIN MAN
</b>             That was stupid.

First, he pops Jason right in the jaw. Jason stumbles
backward, dazed. Then he reaches for his gun, in the
process, loosening his grip on Alex...

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             Jason, get down!

Alex spins out of the Thin Man's grasp and does a full
roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the Thin Man's
hands. The Thin Man immediately responds, throwing two
quick punches, which Alex expertly blocks and then follows
with a hitch-kick to the chin.

Jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating.

<b>                           JASON
</b>             What the hell is going on?

What's going on is a world class ass-kicking, courtesy of his
girlfriend. While the action star watches in amazement, Alex
unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make
Jet Li green with envy.

The Thin Man doesn't stand a chance. A flying side kick
sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell. We
follow the fight...

<b>INT. STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS
</b>
... to the first landing. The Thin Man, battered and bruised,
reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun, but
Alex is too fast for him. She stamps on his hand, then
drops a knee to his throat.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             Right now, just by leaning forward, I

She presses harder.

Jason slams out into the stairwell, looking for Alex. He
finds her on her walkie talkie, the Thin Man handcuffed
to the staircase.

<b>                            ALEX
</b>             Hi, Jason.   Gimme one second?

Jason nods, sure.

We go to another triptych, all three Angels on their cell
phones in different parts of arena.

<b>                           ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>             Angels! Knox planted the bomb in the
             basement, and it's timed to go off
             when the game clock hits zero!

<b>                           NATALIE (O.S.)

<b>                           DYLAN (O.S.)
</b>             I'll look for the bomb!

Alex turns back to Jason. He's clearly having a difficult
time processing everything he's just seen.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             I lied to you Jason.    I'm not a

Alex smiles.    Runs off.

<b>INT. ARENA
</b>
Natalie stares up at the clock... :30.       :29.

The WHISTLE BLOWS.

<b>                            REFEREE
</b>             Time out!

Whew, that was close. But it'll start up any second.       She
has to keep it stopped. But how? She glances to the
sidelines and gets an idea.

<b>ON THE COURT --
</b>
MUSIC starts from overhead, the respective teams' cheerleaders
coming out for one last routine.

As they kick into gear, Natalie comes out with them, dressed
as a Duke cheerleader. She follows along with the dancers, a
bit timid at first, then more confident as she gets into it.

<b>INT. ARENA BASEMENT -- BENEATH THE COURT
</b>
Dylan races through the basement, looking for the briefcase.
Then she spots it, hooked into some wires that snake up
into ceiling above.

Dylan approaches it cautiously.       She slowly opens the top...

<b>                           DYLAN
</b>                    (to herself)
             Alright, Dylan, all we have to do is
             figure out which wire to cut.

<b>REVEAL THE BOMB --
</b>
there are about fifty different wires, in every color in
the Crayola box.

<b>                            DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Oh, shit.

<b>INT. COURTSIDE
</b>
Alex, still searching for Charlie, notices something strange.

<b>                           ALEX
</b>             You're kidding me.

</b>
<b>NATALIE
</b>
is fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full-
out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other
cheerleaders. She's better.

<b>ON THE COURT
</b>
The SONG ends. The Cheerleaders vacate the court, but Natalie
keeps dancing her heart out. She has 18,000 fans watching
her, and she's totally in the moment. But there's another
agenda as well...

<b>                        COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER
</b>          The time out is over, but one
          cheerleader doesn't seem to notice.
          Officials can't start the clock again
          while she's on the court.

<b>INT. MIAMI ARENA -- CONTINUOUS
</b>
Dylan has picked two wires.

<b>                        DYLAN
</b>          Chartreuse and magenta.   This has
          gotta be it.

She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when...

<b>                        KNOX (O.S.)
</b>          I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

She spins to see Knox, standing behind her.

<b>                        KNOX (CONT'D)
</b>          See, if you snip ANY of those wires,
          the bomb WILL blow up.

<b>                        DYLAN
</b>          It's gonna blow anyway, once the
          clock gets to zero.

<b>                        KNOX
</b>          Who told you that, my idiotic
          henchman? Do you think I tell him
          ANYTHING that's confidential?

He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one
we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene.

<b>                        KNOX (CONT'D)
</b>          THIS is what triggers that bomb.     So

          think you and I could have worked out.

<b>                        DYLAN
</b>          Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you

Knox laughs.

          Well, I must be going. If you like
          your body parts attached to your
          torso, I suggest you do the same.

Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>          Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded.

<b>                        NATALIE

<b>                        KNOX
</b><b>          NO!

Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high.

<b>                        KNOX (CONT'D)
</b>          I'll blow this building sky high, I swear!

Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows.

<b>                        KNOX
</b>          Charlie?

That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years,
we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing.

He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a
"We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by
Charlie's appearance.

<b>                        ANGELS
</b>          Charlie?

Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly.

             Just shoot me, Eric.

Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target.

It's a horribly tense moment.       The Angels are frozen, watching
Knox decide Charlie's fate.

Knox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do
this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined.
He starts lowering his gun.

<b>                           KNOX

<b>BLAM!

It all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting
Charlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox.
Alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance
to go off.

Dylan runs to Charlie's side.

<b>                            DYLAN
</b>             Charlie, no.   NO!

She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round
their fallen leader. He gasps for air.

<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)
</b>             He's trying to say something.

Then Dylan notices something weird. He's not gasping for
air, there's something stuck in his mouth.

With a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. It's a voice
chip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene.

<b>                            BOSLEY

<b>                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)
</b>             Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.

with a calm assurance, fireballs exploding behind them.

They won.

As MUSIC rises, the ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends, then peels
away to reveal...

<b>EXT. GORGEOUS BEACH - DAY

The angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in-
hand. Bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc
on his sniffer.

Charlie is on the cellular speakerphone.

walking across the beach towards them. Each is carrying a

<b>A SUNNY DECK

We're in Charlie's point-of-view. We can see part of his
reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face,
but we get some sense of the man.

He turns away, begins walking.    Steps down onto the sand.

<b>                           CHARLIE

             I'd love to, Angels. But I have some
             precious treasures to watch over.

With that, he hangs up. We stay in his P.O.V., walking
across the beach. And it's not just any beach.

<b>TO THE LEFT, WE NOTICE
</b>
<b>PETE AND JASON
</b>
approaching.    We're on the same beach.

Looking right, we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley.
They have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them.

A beat, then Dylan looks back.

She looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we
move past. Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie?
From her reaction, it's not clear.

A beat, then we...

Dylan looks back forward again. Did she just see Charlie?
Her smile tells us she thinks she did.

She raises a toast.

</b>          To Charlie.

They knock glasses.

Right at the moment we should probably fade out, Bosley
spills his icy drink in his lap. His eyes go wide.

The Angels just have to laugh.
