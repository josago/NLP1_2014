          A big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near
          the freeway into Cape Town. The RUGBY FIELDS are immaculate.
          FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with
          total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH.
                         
          Right ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an
          area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK
          AND "COLORED" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose
          game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare
          feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are
          noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys.
                         
          Two cultures, separated by more than the high boundary fence.

          The rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and
          do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes
          right by them. The coach shakes his head in disgust.

          at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple
          the blankets too much.
                         
          On the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00.
          The man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake. He reaches

          NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in

          someone twenty years younger.

          The second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed,
          leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed. Or a
          prison bunk.

          Dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down
          the stairs and heads for the front door.
                         
          This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the
          President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous
          man on the planet.

          Mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a
          moment to savor the air. It is bone dry and cold -- typical
          conditions in the Highveld at this time of year.
                         
          It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is
          completely alone in the world.
                         
          The big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the
          driveway gate.
                         
          When Mandela steps away from the house, A UNIFORMED SOUTH
          AFRICAN POLICEMAN IN THE GUARDHOUSE pushes the button that
          opens the gate.

          a big, scowling man dressed in a suit. He checks the load on
          a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster.

          Behind Linga, in the back seat, sits JASON TSHABALALA, a

          eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline.
                         
          They get out of the BMW, fast and quiet. This does not look
          good.

           Morning boys. How are you?
                         
          Jason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his
          number one bodyguard. They are both former "terrorists", and
          they are utterly devoted to Mandela.

</b>           Good.
                         
          Mandela picks up the pace. Jason and Linga fall back, so
          that they are a few steps behind him.
                         
          They share a quick look. They hate this walk. It scares
          them. There's no way for it to be anything but completely
          unsanitary, from a security point of view.

          looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is
          warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost
          all the time.
                         
          But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask

          Magnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved
          African field stone, with an Italian tiled roof, situated on
          a hill overlooking Pretoria. The seat of power.
                         
          Today, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi-

          We move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that

          -- where people who worked for the De Klerk regime are
          packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the

          old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of

          offices are already deserted.

          Two international front rows come together with bone-
          crunching force.
                         
          Huge, violent men grunt like bulls. The crowd roar vibrates
          the stadium. The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked
          together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies
          under the watchful eye of the referee.
                         
          Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more
          glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it.
                         
          The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the
          scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum
          force.
                         
          The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the
          scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out
          laterally to the wing, with lightning speed.
                         
          The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing
          Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which
          bounces erratically --
                         
          -- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last
          burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle,
          and the wing scores in the corner.
                         
          As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find
          the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on
          their hips, stunned.

          Mrs. Brits leaves. Mandela does not sit until the door
          closes behind her. Pienaar only sits after he does.

          The entire Springbok squad has been on a training run through
          Cape Town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people.
                         
          (This is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. It
          really happened.)
                         
          When they are recognized, drivers toot their horns,
          pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly
          still white).
                         
          As they approach the hotel grounds, Pienaar surges to the
          front, so that he can give them a message as they pass
          through the hotel gate.

          Pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where,
          under one small light, we see "Invictus", the poem Mandela
          wrote out by hand.
                         
          Pienaar begins reading it. There is a soft knock at his
          door. Pienaar goes to it, opens it. It is Nerine,
          accompanied by a cop.
                         
          Pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that Nerine can enter.
          As soon as the door closes behind her, Nerine says:

          responds -- then pulls away.

          The highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we
          saw in the township. This continues the education of those
          who do not know rugby.
                         
          So, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the
          resulting scrum.
                         
          We see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting
          lineout.
                         
          We see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling,
          strategic kicking at it's very best. Both teams are crisp
          and strong.

          Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the

          (In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the

          Pienaar peers into the cell. It is tiny. There is no bed,
          just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of
          blankets. A chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate
          are the only other objects in the room.
                         
          A couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. The
          barred window is opaque. It lets in light but does not allow
          the prisoner a view.
                         
          When Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. He
          can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time.
                         
          This is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. Pienaar is
          stunned by it. He turns, slowly, looking at Mandela's world
          for over twenty years.

          We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. And mostly from
          a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of TV
          coverage. Say, at closest, the referee's point of view.
                         
          Not now. Not for the climax. We experience this beautiful
          piece of mayhem up close and personal.
                         
          We're inside the heaving scrums. We are the ball. We see
          the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on
          abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with
          subcutaneous blood.

          We feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into
          flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fist
          smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolling
          maul.
                         
          For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as
          the Springbok coach wanted.
                         
          This match is all about a less talented team stifling the
          best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness.
                         
          This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting
          pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into
          making mistakes. Lots of them.
                         
          Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of
          movement, no electric building of momentum.
                         
          Because of one thing: tackling.
                         
          Tackling and tackling and tackling again.
                         
          The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation
          holds its breath --
                         
          -- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height,
          wraps him up and brings him down.
                         
          The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down from
          behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle.
                         
          We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want;
          from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the
          country. But, in truth, our attention belongs on the field.
                         
          ON PIENAAR, continually exhorting his men, leading by
          example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield.
                         
          ON LOMU, who always seems just one broken tackle away from
          running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles.
                         
          ON THIRTY BIG, STRONG, BATTLE-SCARRED MEN, who have devoted
          their entire lives to this moment. They are not playing for

          Outdated notions. We miss them.
                         
          No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves match
          each other, penalty goal for penalty goal.
                         
          With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. The
          penalty goals are unchallenged. It is up to the kicker to
          make them or fail. That is pressure.

          fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, and
          with the All Black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal
          through the uprights.
                         
          The Springboks lead 9 - 6. A tight match.
                         
          So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second
          half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 -
<b>          9.

          camp in the Springbok half.
                         
          The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half,
          who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal.
                         
          The kick soars into the air, high and straight.
