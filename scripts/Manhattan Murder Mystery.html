<b>          NOTE
</b>
          Most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand-
          held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around
          the set, and get constantly closer and further from the
          characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such
          as «long shot» or «full shot» or «medium shot» here and there to
          give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the
          beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements
          of the camera.

          While the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the
          jazz music.
                         
          The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and
          starts moving around the building.

                         
<b>          HOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHT
</b>
          Long shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the
          rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience.
                         
          The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in
          their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol
          seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts
          her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward
          her.

<b>                          CAROL

<b>                          LARRY
</b>           You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without
           being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you
           next week.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           I know, honey, I promised. I know.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

</b>           Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see
           the puck.
                         
          The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has
          done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Yay, hooray.
                         
          Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than
          ever.
                         
<b>          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT
</b>                         
          A nice-looking apartment building in New-York.
                         
          Full shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door.
          An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is
          writing on a book.
                         
          Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the
          building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a
          newspaper, the «Daily News».
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Yeah.
                         
          The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow
          back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple
          keeps on walking through the lobby.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve
           victims, dismembered them and ate them.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Yeah, I'll say.
                         
          They reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the
          wall between the two elevators.
                         
<b>          LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
</b>                         
          Medium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door
          slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper.
          Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Hold the elevator.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           I'm coming.
                         
          Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the
          door to keep it from closing.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Hold the elevator.
                         
          Paul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple.
          He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair.
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           That's right.
                         
<b>                          PAUL
</b>           Thank you.
                         
          Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The
          elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol.
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh, you do ?
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           Exercising changed my life.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Well, geez...
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.
                         
<b>                          PAUL
</b>           We bought a treadmill last week.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it
           because it was just taking up too much space.
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           Oh, it-it-it...
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a
           while. That was her problem.
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all
           those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never
           gonna get that.
                         
<b>          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
</b>                         
          Full shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls,
          grey carpeting, dark wooden doors.
                         
          We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by
          Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly
          understand the following dialogue.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh, I know. It's late.
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           It's so wonderful, meeting.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh, well, yeah.
                         
<b>                          PAUL
</b>           It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never
           meet them... You guys...
                         
          The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand
          it better.
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           ... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know...
           and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.
                         
<b>                          PAUL
</b>           Well, anyway... good night.
                         
          Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near
          the elevator.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...
                         
          Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks
          one step in Larry's direction.
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           Oh, uh, say, hello ?
                         
          Paul starts opening his apartment door, just across the hallway
          from the elevator.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Huh ? Yeah ?
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN
</b>           Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and
           have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.
                         
          The camera pans around toward Larry and Carol. Larry makes a
          negative sign with his hand.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh, oh well that'd be fine...
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           She makes great Irish coffee.
                         
          Mute conversation between Carol and Larry. Larry evidently doesn't
          want to accept Lilian's invitation, but Carol wants to.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           Oh, please ? Uh uh, I want you to give me a treadmill
           lesson.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           There's a movie on television I want to watch.
                         
          Carol starts walking toward Lilian and Paul's apartment, followed
          reluctantly by Larry.
                         
          The camera pans around during Carol's next line, and we see Carol
          entering Lilian an Paul's apartment.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out,
           then believe me, anybody can.
                         
          She laughs, and Larry, entering the apartment behind her, utters a
          forced laugh.

          looks like them.
                         
          Medium shot of Lilian walking across the bedroom toward the large
          double bed. She walks near the famous treadmill.

           No. Please, it's easy.
                         
          Lilian picks up a book on a table near the bed.
                         
<b>                          LILLIAN

          She is standing near the treadmill. Lilian shows her one of the
          diagram in the book.

           very beautiful.
                         
          Larry is seated near a small table, on which Paul puts the book
          down. Paul sits down next to Larry.

</b>           Yeah.
                         
          Paul picks up a special philatelist magnifying glass and puts it
          in front of the stamp, for Larry to have a better look at it.
                         
<b>                          PAUL
</b>           Look at that. And this plate block is quite unique because
           it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.
          Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his
          head.
<b>                          LARRY

           Good. We can get back to this later. Come on in.
                         
          We see Paul's hand on Larry's shoulder, pushing him toward the
          centre of the room.
                         
          A little later.

          Larry and Carol on the sofa, Paul and Lilian on two armchairs.

          just left. It is the apartment of a couple of New-York

          her.
                         
          She sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You
           know, I'm sure as much as once a week.

           Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do.
                         
          Carol stands up from the bed and moves across the room. The
          camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol,
          so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and
          the large clock on it.
           CAROL (voice over from behind the partition)
           Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old
           shoes, are we ? Do you think ?

          Full shot of the screen of the theater, on which the film «Double
          Indemnity» is shown. And under the screen, in the dark, the back
          of some of the spectator's heads.
                         
          This film is a very famous 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder, and
          referred by the Library of Congress as one of the hundred best
          films of the Twentieth Century. The term «double indemnity» refers
          to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the
          payout in cases when death is caused by certain accidental means.

          around to follows them inside the building. Larry puts his hand on
          Carol's back to guide her inside the building. We see an ambulance

          Carol walks to a chest of drawers, on top of which she drops the

          She sits down on her side of the bed, and takes her socks off.
          While talking, Larry puts the book and his glasses on the night-
          table. Carol switches the light off on her night table and gets
          into the bed.

          finding any coffee in the cupboard, she closes it, stands up and
          turns around to look inside the cupboard above the sink. She
          closes it, and bends down to look inside the cupboard next to the
          dishwasher. She seems surprised by something and pauses. Then she
          takes a copper funeral urn from inside the cupboard. She stands up
          and takes the lid off the urn. She looks inside the urn and closes

          Medium shot on the bed. Larry is asleep, but Carol is not. She
          moves in the bed, and then sits up. She turns around, pats her
          pillow, and tries to lie back on her side. But she sits up again,
          looking around the room. Eventually, she gets out of the bed.
                         
          She walks around the bed in the dark, and switches on the lights
          in the corridor. The camera follows her in the corridor.

          Larry hops toward her, still trying to put his slippers on. She

          While Larry is answering her, Carol opens the front door and peeks

          Jack walks out of his workshop and along one of the basement
          corridors.

          The camera follows Jack walking away.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, God.
                         
          The camera turns around to a reverse angle shot on Carol, still in
          the workshop. She looks around, apparently looking for something.
          She peeks through the door of the workshop, to make sure Jack is
          not coming back too early. Carol rushes to a key-box on the wall,
          into which there is a spare key for every apartment in the
          building. She selects a key, takes it out of the box and puts it
          in her pocket. Then she leaves the workshop toward the staircase.

          suddenly stops a few feet from the next sidewalk. He feels his

          He turns around and starts walking back on the crosswalk.

          Carol has picked up a few papers from a low table, and is looking
          at them. She puts her hand into her trouser pocket to get her
          glasses out. She puts her glasses on to have a better look at the

</b>           So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you
           helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little
           bit, but, uh...
                         
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean...
                         
          They are now at the reception desk level, and, since the camera is
          following them, we can see the young gentleman the receptionist is
          talking with.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry
           about, you know ? This book makes «Finnegan's Wake» look
           like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's-
           It's-It's...
                         
          They are now walking along a corridor.
                         
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take
           suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great.
           Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much
           of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how
           much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own
           life ?
          They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private
          room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on
          a sofa.
                         
<b>                          MARCIA

           LARRY (voice over)
           Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ?
                         
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           No, but I put myself through school playing poker.
                         
          The camera pans to Larry, who is standing up at the other end of
          the room, looking through some documents.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

           MARCIA (voice over)
           No, but I still know how.

           MARCIA (voice over)
           Yeah.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

           MARCIA (voice over)
           I could turn your game around in two hours.

           all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write
           so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is,
           uh, too good to be true.
                         
          Larry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps. The camera
          pans back to Marcia. She has a cigarette in her hand.
                         
<b>                          MARCIA

          The camera pans back to Larry, who is looking through the huge
          pile of paper on his laps, perhaps a manuscript.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

           MARCIA (voice over)
           No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do

           MARCIA (voice over)
           Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ?

          cigarette.

           Is everything okay ? Really ? No, I could, sure.

          He puts the telephone down on its hook.

          Carol walks rapidly inside the apartment, followed by Larry. Paul

          Close shot on the clock on the wall : the time is just after one
          o'clock. The room is completely dark and the clock is the only
          source of light. The camera pans to the bed and on Carol, sound
          asleep. We hear a noise, like an object dropping down. Carol
          instantly wakes up. She gets up and the camera pans to Larry,
          still asleep. He eventually wakes up, moves around in the bed,
          takes his glasses from the night-table and put them on his nose.

          This is very nice lounge in New-York, very tastefully decorated.
          It looks like one of those old English Club in London. Beautiful

<b>          A RESTAURANT - INTERIOR DAY
</b>                         
          Full shot on a restaurant. This part of the restaurant is empty.
          Only two people, Larry and Marcia, are seated at a table behind a
          set of crossed wooden bars, on the other side of which the camera
          is located. Apparently Marcia is teaching Larry how to play poker.
          Marcia wears sunglasses and has a cigarette stuck between her
          lips.
                         
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           If I get two kings, I take one. Otherwise, I fold.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           So...
                         
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           Got it ?
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           I-I never go out. I-I-I-I-I just, I can't take... I
           can't...
                         
          Marcia shuffles the cards.
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           That's how you wind up on welfare.
                         
          The camera pans away from the two players to another section of
          the restaurant, where a few people are still eating. It looks like
          a very good restaurant, with waiters dressed with white shirt and
          black vest.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           You know, I need the action, for some reason. I-I can't...
           I bet anything. Okay, just...
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Cut ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           No, no, go ahead, I trust you. Lay it on me.
                         
          The camera pans back on Larry and Marcia. This is a different
          shot, with the camera in front of their table. Marcia seems very
          relaxed with the cards in her hands, when Larry seems quite
          nervous. He holds the card very close to his eyes, seeming afraid
          that his partner will look at them.
                         
<b>                          MARCIA

<b>                          LARRY
</b>           No. What are you talking about ? I had rum cake.
                         
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           Want any cards ?
                         
          Larry shuffles his cards in his hand, hesitating on his next move.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Uh, one second. Just let me, let me see, see what I,
           possibilities I got here. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna have, uh...
           I'll have, uh... I'm gonna have four cards.

<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Yeah.
                         
          She gives him his four cards.

<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Inside and outside straight.
          Marcia looks at her cards. Larry keeps shuffling his cards very
          nervously.
                         
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           You're in trouble, now.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           You know, I can't escape the feeling that my-my wife is
           becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really
           bothering me.
                         
<b>                          MARCIA
</b>           Really.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you
           know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they
           just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh,

          Full shot of the entrance of the Waldron Hotel. The pavement is
          wet but it doesn't seem to rain anymore. The camera pans to a car
          parked on the other side of the street a short distance from the

          A modern clean lobby, with a very conventional decoration. Medium
          shot of a clerk cleaning the lobby floor with a broom. She is a
          woman in her forties, very casually dressed with a flowered blouse
          and a beige sweater, and with uncombed hair hanging on her
          shoulders.
          The camera pans around toward the street door. Carol enters the
          lobby, followed by Larry. Carol is holding a small present-wrapped
          parcel in her hand and walks toward the clerk.

</b>           Okay. Sure.
                         
          Carols walks away, but Larry stays with the clerk. He takes a
          banknote out of his pocket.

          He gives the banknote to the clerk, who seems a bit surprised by
          Larry's attitude and present. She looks at the banknote.

          Medium shot on the elevator door opening. Carol walks out,
          followed by Larry, who closes the door. Carol starts looking

          and Larry walk along the corridor, away from the camera.

          They have stopped walking at the end of the corridor, in front of
          a door. Carol knocks on that door.

          Long shot of the entrance of the hotel, seen from the other side
          of the street. A blue police car is parked in front of the hotel.
          Two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are
          talking with Carol and Larry. They both try to explain the
          situation to the police officers. But since they both talk
          together, the police officers have a hard time understanding them.
                         
          While they are talking, the camera zooms forward from a long shot
          to a full shot of the group.

           hap... We're sit... I saw her on this bus, right ? And...
           And she has... no place at all. Then we checked anyway. So
           we were just sitting there, just waiting...

           We-We-We were there. She-She was very nervous. So-So we
           were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and
           looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her
           hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the
           bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in
           the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as
           best as I could.
                         
          One of the plainclothes police officers stops their talking.

           Yeah, she was definitely laying here.
                         
          The camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police
          officers talking with Carol and Larry in the middle of the room.
          The following dialogue transcript separates what Larry says from
          what Carol says, but, most of the time, they talk together at the
          same time, making it quite difficult for us, or for the police
          officers, to follow their conversation.

</b>           This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like
           something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you
           know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th
           avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life

           while we were there. Probably hiding in the closet.

           but I'm a little drunk.
                         
<b>                          CAROL

          The camera hasn't moved, so now we get a medium shot of Larry and
          Carol. They have reached their car, and Carol walks around it to
          get into the passenger's seat.

          Larry tries to play the part of the relaxed policeman doing his
          job, but he overdoes it and he looks more bizarre than serious.

          card the police officer gave him. He shows it to the clerk and
          then slides it through a small rectangular hole at the bottom of
          the window. The clerk takes it and looks at it.

          of the trap, with its arms moving around.
                         
<b>                          CAROL

<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Oh, my God. It's her.
                         
          The camera tilts down to floor level and Larry and Carol.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           So that's where he hid her.

</b>           Oh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a
           neurotic's jackpot.
                         
          Suddenly, the lights switch off. The cabin is now pitch dark.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh ! Oh, Larry, hold on. I'm scared.
                         
          We hear the noise of the elevator starting again.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

<b>                          LARRY

           returning shoes. It's dark in here.
                         
          We hear the noise of the elevator door opening.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           What ? What are you doing ?
                         
          Apparently Carol has come out of the elevator.
                         
<b>          HOTEL WALDRON - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          This shot is supposed to be in the basement of the hotel, but
          since it is still pitch dark, we can't tell the difference.

          Larry lights a match, and we see his scared face lit by the flame
          of the match.
                         
<b>                          CAROL

          Larry blows the match, because it is burning his fingers.

          He lights another match. We very dimly see the basement walls
          around them.

          Medium full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us in a
          corridor. Beside the light of the match, there is some other dim
          light coming from somewhere in the basement.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

</b>           There. Turn the light on.
          Larry switches the light on. They are in a room with beige walls.
          There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

          Carol tries to open a door near Larry, but it is locked.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you

           back.
                         
          Larry walks back a few steps and rushes on the door, trying to
          break it open.
                         
<b>                          CAROL

</b>           Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second.
                         
          He does it another time.

<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Must be one of those new doors.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Let's try out here.
                         
          Carol points to another room opening in the one they are in.
                         
          Carol and Larry are now walking in a lit corridor.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

</b>           Oh. What's down there ?
                         
          Carol walks rapidly toward a dark section of the corridor. The
          camera follows her.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !
                         
          She has reached a door with a barred window showing the street
          outside.
                         
<b>                          CAROL

           entrance.
                         
          She tries to open the door, but it is a bit stuck.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

</b>           Come on, get it open.
                         
          Carol succeeds in opening the door.

          Long shot on the dark street. At a distance, we see a man putting
          a large oblong-shaped parcel in the trunk of a car. The man looks
          very much like Paul.
                         
          The camera pans around to give us a reverse-angle medium shot of
          Carol and Larry coming out of the basement of the hotel. They
          stopped in the middle of the short staircase.

<b>          NEW-YORK - AERIAL OVERVIEW OF BROOKLYN BRIDGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
</b>          The camera starts with the interchange at one end of the bridge,
          then pans to the bridge itself. At this early hour of the night,
          the bridge still has a lot of traffic moving on it. Then the
          camera moves down to get a closer look of the traffic on the
          bridge.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Oh, Jesus. I-I can't c... I can't follow his car.
                         
          The camera follows the moving traffic on the bridge, and certainly
          also follows Larry's car, even though, from this height, we can't
          tell which car it is.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Well, he's right up ahead. He's right there.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Where, up ahead ? I don't know which car I'm following
           here. I... You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase
           somebody in a car. I'm gonna have an accident. I'm, you
           know, I'll-I'll-I'll wind up hitting a school bus or
           something.

           time.

          New-York. Larry's car drives slowly inside the park, coming toward
          us. There is no one else at this time of the night. The place is
          lit by a few lampposts, and there is smoke behind Larry's car.

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           That's his car.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Oh, it is his car.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           It is his.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Yes. Yes. Yes.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Well, of course.
                         
          The car stops.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Okay, let me turn the light off.
                         
          The car headlights switch off.
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Be careful, be careful, be careful.
                         
          They both get out of the car, and they start walking toward the
          place where Carol saw the other car.
                         
          They reach the other car surrounded by huge piles of metal scrap.
          The car and the scenery around it are lit by a powerful red light.
          Carol and Larry run toward the place where the red light comes
          from. It is inside a huge building. But they don't go inside the
          building and, instead, keep on running along the building.
                         
          Medium shot on Larry and Carol. Carol stops Larry and points at
          something.

          The camera pans to the thing Carol was pointing at. A body, half-
          wrapped in a white sheet, is being lifted by a huge electromagnet.
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body !
                         
          Reverse high-angle shot on Larry and Carol, as if they were seen
          from the magnet.

          Larry takes Carol's hand and runs toward the magnet.
                         
          Reverse angle long shot on a group of workers in the background.
          Then the camera pans to a reverse angle medium shot on Larry and
          Carol coming out between rows of huge heavy-duty bags.
                         
          Reverse angle medium shot on a huge cauldron full of hot melted
          metal. A huge pair of metal jaws is dropping metal scraps into the
          cauldron. Among the metal scraps, we see Mrs. House's body

          The camera zooms to a close shot on the cauldron.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Good bye, Mrs. House.
                         
          Reverse angle shot on Larry and Carol. Then reverse angle long
          shot on the cauldron. A lot of bright sparks are coming out of the
          cauldron.
                         
          Long shot on the building. Larry and Carol are coming out of the
          building. They start running toward the camera. The camera pans
          around to a medium shot on Paul's car. Through the windshield, we
          see Paul behind the wheel, lit by the red light coming from the
          melted metal. He starts the car and drives away.
                         
          The camera pans around toward Carol and Larry, still running - too
          late - toward Paul's car.

           We came home that night. There had been a heart attack.
                         
          Some neighbors are gathered around Paul's apartment door. Larry
          asks them questions.

          The camera pans inside Paul's corridor, where Mrs. House's body,
          completely covered by a white sheet, is lying dead on a stretcher
          with the doctor and the emergency medical team around her.

          to the woman, then another one to Paul, and kisses him on the

          Later. The woman has a hard attack. Paul helps her to walk to the
          sofa.
           MARCIA (voice over)
           She has a heart attack. She drops dead spontaneously.
           They had no thought of killing her. Maybe they wished she

           see a golden opportunity.

          woman, lying on the sofa, into her own clothes.

</b>                         
          Full slightly high-angled shot on the stage. In the middle of the
          stage floor, a white circle, on which there is a chair and a small
          table with a telephone. Suzanne Raphael, a young woman, is
          auditioning. She is seated on the chair, holding the telephone.
          Behind Suzanne, which is the left side of the stage seen from the
          audience, a white wall, with a doorless opening. On either side of
          the wall, two red columns. And on either side of the girl, which
          are the front and the back of the stage, two red metallic frames.
          In front of the girl, a video camera on a tripod, with an operator
          standing behind the camera. Actually, the operator is Sy, Larry
          and Carol's friend, whom we have seen much earlier in the film, in
          the antique market and at Elaine's restaurant. The stage is well
          lit, when the audience hall is in the dark.
                         
<b>                          SUZANNE

           this.
                         
          She slams the phone down. The camera pans around to show us the
          right side of the stage, where there is several rows of theatre
          seats and a table in front of the seats. Ted, Marcia and Marilyn
          are seated in the front row. Marilyn is Sy's wife, whom we have
          also seen earlier in the film. Carol is seated in the second row,
          behind Marcia.
                         
<b>                          TED

          Carol taps on Marilyn's shoulder, and whispers something to her.
          Ted joins them in their whispered conversation. The camera pans
          back on the stage. Larry, with a clipboard in his hand, has
          entered the stage, pushing Helen in front of him.

          her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up
          the phone handset from the telephone on the table. She overdoes it
          a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not.

          Medium shot of Marilyn standing behind a computer. Close to her,
          Carol is seated on a table, and Ted is standing next to her. They
          are both looking at a large video monitor. On the monitor screen

          shot of a big high-tech tape recorder, on which Sy is working. We
          see his hands cutting off a short section of the audio tape, and
          gluing back the two severed ends of the tape together.

           He never even did that. He went and shot Broome. And that
           was not part of the plan. Broome might have got to the
           police before he died.
                         
          Larry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way. We see
          the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of
          the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage.
                         
           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)
           And if the cops traced it to Grisby... and the cops made

          mirror breaks with a crashing sound.

          toward Larry.

          Behind Paul, we see the film on the screen. We have now reached
          the famous last scene of the film, shot in the hall of mirrors.
          Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film,
          just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry
          are reflected on the many mirrors scattered around.
                         
           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)
           I knew I'd find you two together.
                         
          Arthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many
          mirrors in the film. Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered
          the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the
          mirrors scattered around her. She has a gun in the hand which is
          not holding the cane.
                         
          While Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on
          the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from
          the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder.

          Close shot on Gladys' face. While she is talking, the camera pans
          away from her, showing her reflection on a mirror.
                         
<b>                          GLADYS

          The camera keeps on panning, showing another reflection of Gladys.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           I never led you on.
                         
           GLADYS (with a very harsh voice)

          stairs.

           With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell. You are aiming

          Medium shot on the many reflections of Paul. He fires his gun
          twice. We hear noises of mirrors being broken by the gunshots,
          both in the film, and on the backstage itself.
          Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections. She turns
          around, not being sure, because of the mirrors, of Paul's exact
          location.
                         
          Medium shot of Paul walking on the backstage. We still hears
          noises of mirrors being broken, but we don't know if the noises
          come from the film or the backstage.

          the screen and, of course, the film projected on it, and in which
          the mirrors are being broken. Paul enters from behind a mirror
          frame, and falls on the floor. Gladys' reflection appears in
          several mirrors. She stops and looks at Paul's body lying on the
          floor.

          Carol, who was walking quite rapidly, suddenly slows down. Track
          shot of Larry and Carol, with the camera in front of them
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Oh, you know, Larry, you were surprisingly brave.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           What do you mean surprisingly ?
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Yeah.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           You seem shocked.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Well...
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           You know, I'm a pretty good guy, you know.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Well, you know... Yeah, I know, uh...
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight ? Let's not go to
           any restaurant where they serve cowards.
                         
          Carol laughs.
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           I don't know.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           I... What are you laughing at ?
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           You know, Larry, I love you. I love you.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia ? Isn't that
           ridiculous ? Don't you know that I could only love you ?

<b>                          CAROL
</b>           You were jealous of Ted.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Ted ?
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           Yeah.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           You've got to be kidding. Take away his-his-his elevator
           shoes and his fake suntan and his capped teeth... and what
           do you have ?
                         
<b>                          CAROL
</b>           You.
                         
          Larry laughs. They have reached their building and they enter it.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Right. I love that.

          An attendant opens the door for them. Through the glass doors, we
          see them cross the lobby toward the elevator.
