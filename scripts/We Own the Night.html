</b><b>          A PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY...
</b>          THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the
          foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF
          MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems
          to separate the two. A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER
          LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME.
<b>          
</b>          MILITARY DRUMS. HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN, in their DRESS
          BLUES, ENTER from FRAME RIGHT. A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN.

</b><b>          FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH:
</b><b>          
</b>          New York, New York.   1988.
<b>          
</b>          A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing
          with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in
          recent memory.
<b>          
</b>          The old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic
          groups rise up to seize control without respect for
          traditional rules of engagement.
<b>          
</b>          Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and
          scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their
          own at the rate of twice a month...
<b>          
</b>          The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER
          THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE. As we begin to
          ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING
<b>          POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S "ROCK THE CASBAH"...
</b><b>                                                       SMASH CUT TO:
</b><b>          
</b>          CLOSE ON: BOBBY GREEN, thirty. He is passionate and vital
          and handsome, a real physical presence. His CLOTHES are
          stylish, expensive. A sly SMILE. He steps forward, into:
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. STOREROOM
</b><b>          
</b>          The camera MOVES with him to SEE: ROSARIO DIAZ, twenties,
          dark-skinned, impossibly gorgeous. Leaning up against the
          wall, biting her lower lip, eyeing Bobby with true desire.
<b>

          "BROOKLYN". They really GO AT IT. They are ferocious; as
          they DEVOUR each other:

<b>          
</b>          Then we HEAR a fist BANGING ON A DOOR, a MUFFLED VOICE:

<b>          
</b>          No ANSWER--they're too busy making out. Then, MORE
          BANGING. They both START LAUGHING. The voice continues:

<b>          
</b>          She grabs him; he moves back in, starts MAULING her again.
          She SLIDES DOWN his body, perhaps to perform fellatio...
<b>          
</b><b>                                                         CUT TO:

</b><b>          INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM
</b><b>          
</b>          A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent,
          pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area,
          straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him,
          fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club.
          Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he
          appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his
          name. He is having a blast.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of
          Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch.
          He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S "HEART OF GLASS."
          Bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("Hey, baby!"), a
          pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a
          swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt,
          claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES
          every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN.
<b>          WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN.
</b><b>          
</b><b>                                                               (CONTINUED)

</b><b>          CONTINUED:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table,
          surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne-
          scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men,
          PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them.
<b>          
</b><b>          NEAR THE COAT CHECK
</b><b>          
</b>          Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we
          SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats,
          slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their
          coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets.
          Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian
          with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of
          it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the
<b>          DRUG TRADE.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY
</b><b>          
</b>          A HUGE FIGHT that's breaking out. Violent. Club patrons
          and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO
          moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI,
          forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around
          him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says "SECURITY" on it.
          He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby
          arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio:
<b>          
</b><b>                                      BOBBY GREEN
</b>                       What the fuck's goin' on in here?
<b>          
</b>          Bobby moves RIGHT IN. Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON,
          puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE
          TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend,
          watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly
          detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He
          balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding
          spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing
          his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:
<b>          
</b><b>                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
</b>                       Okay, Bobkes! Looks like you got
                       everything under control here--so
                       uh, so I'm gonna go outside, take
                       my break!
<b>          
</b><b>                                      BOBBY GREEN

                       yours outta trouble, arright?
<b>

</b>                       Yes, your fuckin' majesty!
<b>          
</b>          The Patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from
          Bobby's grip. Bobby looks down at him. With humor:
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Gives the guy a shot in the head. Meanwhile: LOUIS
          saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen
          drunk. He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap.
          Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE
          helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is
          flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON
          HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who
          hurls his guy out of frame):
<b>

                       someplace else!
                              (louder, to all
                               fighters; pointing:)
                       Now listen--one of these days I'm
                       gonna run this whole block, and I
                       see any you in here again--any you--
                       I'll bust your fuckin' hole!
                              (to Freddie)
                       Throw `em out on their ass. I
                       gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys
                       with the old man.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. STAIRWELL
</b><b>          
</b>          Wood-panelled walls. Bobby walks upstairs, fixing his hair.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM
</b><b>          
</b>          An ornate, gaudy place. The walls are covered by mirrors
          with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them.
          Plush couches, clutter. Bobby walks in.
<b>          
</b>          We HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here, nothing like the stuff played
          downstairs. A RUSSIAN CROONER. In an EASY CHAIR sits
          MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY'-EV). He is old,
          kindly, weakened by age; sits next to his babushka wife,
          KALINA. Buzhayev watches a Russian musical program with
          the sound off, listening to his small transistor radio.

</b><b>          CONTINUED:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Bobby leans over, hugs the seated old man. The two EMBRACE
          WARMLY--they are close. Before separating, Buzhayev
          touches his face. KALINA yells happily in RUSSIAN, grabs
          BOBBY, embraces him too. She couldn't be more motherly,
          amd Bobby BEAMS at the treatment.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Bobby is moved, almost embarrassed by the loving attention.
          Then, gently dropping a set of KEYS on a side table:
<b>          
</b><b>                                      BOBBY GREEN
</b>                       Listen, Mr. Buzhayev--I gotta go do
                       something right now. But don't
                       worry--everything's in good shape
                       downstairs.

                       good for us...

<b>          
</b>          Bobby lights up, nods. Marat pats his cheek. Kalina tries
          to give him a small care package of food. He politely
          refuses, and a minor and friendly AD-LIBBED argument in
          Russian ("He said he didn't want any food, and you keep
          trying to give it to him!") breaks out between the old
          husband and his wife. As Bobby exits:

          so. Sharp, tough features--the GLOW of a WINNER. He is
          SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and
          holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Next
          to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their
          older infant, TEDDY.
<b>          
</b>          NEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we
          will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex-
          military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king.
<b>          
</b>          Standing behind Burt are his two closest associates:
          MICHAEL SOLO ("G.Q."), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK
          SHAPIRO ("Pudge"), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge
          hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured
          son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph:

</b>                    One of our Irish brothers was
                    killed in the line of duty last
                    night--detective Edward Conlon was
                    gunned down serving a warrant on
                    Northern Boulevard. The clock's
                    about to strike ten, so I thought
                    we might give a moment of silence
                    to remember.

          motions to Rosario to stop. Out of respect. She does.
          Then: the CHURCH BELL rings. TEN TIMES. Silence. The
          BELL GONGS. The CAMERA DOLLIES PAST: JOSEPH and his
          family, and JACK, and MICHAEL, then past ROSARIO, and BURT,
          and BOBBY. The bell stops. The SEA of BLUE, the POLICE,
          genuflect. Our characters do not. Instead, BOBBY STARES
          at JOSEPH AND BURT across the crowded room. They return
          the glare, and Bobby exits...

          sofa. A couple KISSES in the corner. Everyone's getting
          ready for a night of revelry on the town. They are
          SINGING, having a GREAT TIME. The decor is late `70's,

          PRIMPING in the mirror. Rosario stands on Bobby's king
          bed, DANCING SENSUALLY to the music in a state of partial
          undress. She MOVES with great FREEDOM, puffing on a JOINT.

          THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in CASH, hidden underneath a fake

          private pride, then puts on the watch. Rosario bounces
          down on the bed. Reaching under the bed sneakily, she

</b><b>          
</b>          It's the men's room in the club. Louis is in the stall,
          his pants pulled down. He HEARS: Nezhinski's voice and a
          muffled struggle. Louis immediately pulls his feet up,
          squatting on the toilet seat. Looks into the crack in the
          stall door. We STILL HEAR:
<b>          
</b><b>                                     LOUIS FALSETTI
</b>                      Nezhinski dragged him into the
                      toilet. They stood him up against
                      the wall and held him--
<b>          
</b>          We SEE exactly this. Nezhinski faces the MAN. Two
          associates of Nezhinski's hold him back, covering his mouth
          with silver electrical tape.

                      and I swear to God, Nezhinski just
                      cut it off.
<b>          
</b>          Nezhinski's associates pull down his pants, and Louis sees
          the man's bare ass. The man is panicking, muffled cries
          for help penetrating even the flashback. Nezhinski pulls
          out his switchblade, holds it up to his face, then LOWERS
          IT. A GLINT of REFLECTION on the KNIFE. HORRIBLE.

          really only   focused on Rosario. When Rosario sees him

</b>          As Bobby gags, JOSEPH walks through the club with
          confidence. The place, though absolutely packed, is
          uncharacteristically SILENT. He turns to UNIFORMED COP #2:

</b>          This gets Mike's attention. Joseph signals something to
          him, he nods, moves to the back. Joseph walks over to
          LOUIS, pokes his gut:

</b>          Several COPS laugh. Then: Joseph SEES Bobby, and vice
          versa. CLOSE SHOT on JOSEPH. He sobers, his brashness
          muted. Joe walks toward Vadim and his party. Vadim has
          his face to the wall. Joseph kicks his legs further apart.
          (Joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on
          Vadim.) In Russian, SUBTITLED:

</b>          Vadim turns around. Joseph starts to search him.          He pulls
          a WAD OF MONEY from Vadim's pocket:

<b>          
</b>          Vadim doesn't answer. Joseph takes out a HUGE SWISS ARMY

          in a totally perfunctory manner. Almost mumbles them.

          ESCORTED by TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS, who are very obviously

          quickly ushered out along with tens of others. Marat
          watches, as does Rosario. Louis and Rosario are left
          behind, not having been arrested. Neither has VADIM.
          Joseph moves close to Vadim. With arrogant brio, re: the
          Dark-Skinned White Man, in Russian, subtitled:

<b>          
</b>          JOSEPH EYES VADIM, virtually mocking him. VADIM EYES JOE
          BACK with SILENT RAGE on his face. Then the cops push THE
          YOUNG DARK-SKINNED MAN out, and as they do, he turns back
          to Vadim. The Young Man is TERRIFIED. Bobby, too, is
          hauled out like a common criminal. Cuffed...

          walls are tan brick, peppered with fallout shelter signs.
          Archaic, Robert Moses era-like. Lit entirely by large
          fluorescents overhead, noticeably free of those desks and
          typewriters that are familiar to us from other cop movies.
          A big sign above a bulletin board reads, "WE OWN THE
          NIGHT." Bobby is led in by a PORTLY COP. A madhouse.
          There is BLOOD all over the floor, forming a LAKE.

</b>          The Young Dark-Skinned Man is right outside the cell, his

          time to react. The man pulls the trigger.

          maybe worse than we've yet seen him. But he is HAPPILY
          DRUNK, his eyes BLOODSHOT. He and Louis look at their
          cards. Rosario turns, looks at Bobby for a BEAT. She sees
          a small bruise he's got on his forehead, kisses it.

<b>          
</b>          He starts rubbing her between the legs, under the table.
          She kisses his bruise again. Louis pokes her. Smiling and
          pointing to his crotch:

<b>          
</b>          Rosario lets out a loud laugh.   Louis whispers pearls of
          wisdom to Bobby:

<b>          
</b>          Bobby ignores him.   Instead, aloud, to the Latino man:

                    We will?
<b>          
</b>          Bobby turns to him, winks. The PHONE IS RINGING. A LOT.
          ROSARIO gets up, walks over to the phone near the sofa and
          picks up with a soft "hello". Meanwhile, Bobby puts a
          whole lot of cash in the middle. The Latino Man looks at
          him like he's crazy. Finally:

</b>          She shakes her head as if to say, "I don't know." Slightly
          peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the

<b>          
</b>          Bobby realizes that NO ONE WANTS HIM HERE. He looks
          through the glass to SEE Burt, still speaking to the Mayor.
          Bobby storms out of the room to:

          Bobby decides to walk over.

</b>          Bobby hurriedly takes out his wallet. As he does, we HEAR
          a SOFT CHIME. A WOMAN'S VOICE SOUNDS on the P.A.:

          Charges past the Guard.

<b>          
</b>          The Guards stop him, and a messy struggle ensues.
<b>          
</b>          All of a sudden, Joseph's wife SANDRA emerges from the
          ward. She looks devastated. The struggle stops. All fall
          silent, out of respect. Bobby steps back. Sandra turns to
          look at Bobby. To the Guards:

<b>          
</b>          Bobby walks toward the entrance.   Stops.    Sandra seems to
          read his mind, speaks:

                       for the precinct.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby nods subtly, mouths a "THANK YOU." The Guards step
          aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS:
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. WARD
</b><b>          
</b>          Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face
          is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward.
<b>          
</b>          Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the
          CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is
          completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages
          that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion
          surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN.
<b>          
</b>          It is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't
          expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open
          slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at
          Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm
          gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand.
          Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden:
<b>          
</b><b>                                      NURSE
</b>                       Sir...?
<b>          
</b>          Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The
          connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs
          them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking
          OUTPOURING of FEELING from him.
<b>          
</b>          He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead:
<b>

<b>          
</b>          He waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He
          backs away, his eyes reddened. The camera MOVES INTO a
          CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO:

</b><b>          INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on
          the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught.
          He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino
          teens smoking CRACK.
<b>          
</b>          He goes to one of the apartment doors, KNOCKS.    Opening the
          door is a LATE MIDDLE-AGED LATINO WOMAN.

</b>          Rosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door. He
          and Rosario stare at each other for a moment. Bobby gropes
          for words. His emotions bubble up inside of him; then,
          barely audible, his voice cracking:

<b>          
</b>          He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach.
          She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head.
<b>          
</b>          She shakes her head to reassure him, whispering
          "no...no...". In this moment, he needs her. In this
          moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy...

          in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and
          drinking coffee after their nights on the town. Bobby and
          Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses
          Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She
          looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine.
          Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and
          is busy putting on a show--as usual:

          the drawer and count it when: we HEAR a SOFT BUZZ. He
          quickly looks over, CHECKS THE BEEPER. He stares at the

          over Bobby's head. POINTS A REVOLVER AT BOBBY'S TEMPLE.
          Bobby is startled by the action, blinded. Trying to stay
          calm...

          then PATS BOBBY DOWN, searching for a wire, anything

<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. STREET
</b><b>          
</b>          The Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange
          residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere.
          Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways
          up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns
          and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN
          IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car.
          They pull Bobby out:
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY
</b><b>          
</b>          They walk up the stairs, PULLING Bobby up over the steps.
          He stumbles. They pick him up, lead him to a door.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM
</b><b>          
</b>          Someone pulls the hood off him. Bobby looks around. The
          room is ABSOLUTELY BARE. The driver puts Bobby's bag of
          money down on the floor. A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL
          MASK comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well. Bobby
          surveys the place. Where the hell is he? With that mask
          on his face, we HEAR his BREATHING, loud and present,
          through the sequence.
<b>          
</b>          It could be night or day, we wouldn't know. The windows
          are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. There is
          VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere. Parts of rooms
          are cordoned off with the material. SILHOUETTED FIGURES
          ROAM through the space like apparitions. A SLAVIC-LOOKING
          MAN takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room.
<b>          
</b><b>          IN THE HALLWAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Stands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov
          rifle. Without a word, he motions with a move of his head
          to Bobby. "FOLLOW ME," he seems to be saying.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. BEDROOM
</b><b>          
</b>          Bobby enters the room, right behind Pavel. He SEES: a
          dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. Tables set
          up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them.
          There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic
          musical program silently unfolding.
<b>          
</b>          There are other people in the room: a BROWN-HAIRED MAN; and
          two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN. It's an assembly
          line for the preparation of narcotics.
<b>          
</b>          The SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS. Starts
          counting them methodically. Pavel motions to the Brown-
          Haired Man, puts up two fingers.
<b>          
</b>          On cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then
          takes two large JARS from his desk. Beneath the desk,
          Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages
          of NARCOTICS, stacked against the wall.
<b>          
</b>          This is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE. The Brown-Haired Man
          pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk
          blotter. He sits down, takes off his jacket, REVEALING:
<b>          TATTOOS, UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS.
</b><b>

</b><b>          
</b>          The designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the
          SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadim's own tattoo.
<b>          
</b>          He takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop
          the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE. White powder seeps
          from the package.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and
          pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. He uses
          two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug. Bobby eyes that RUSTY
<b>          LETTER OPENER...
</b><b>          
</b>          The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another
          powder to add to the mix. He is cutting the drug. He
          continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move
          with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef
          on a cooking show.
<b>          
</b>          CLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE. Pavel takes a toot.
          He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste. Bobby accepts. He pulls
          down his mask momentarily, RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY
          OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS, HIS LIP. We HEAR:

<b>

          A DARKENED HALLWAY: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is wearing a
          surgical mask--except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him
          with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second.

</b>          He sifts through the items, lighting the lighter. It
          fires. Bobby gets slightly edgy. Notices that the others

          for Pavel, who holds an AK-47 trained on Bobby.
<b>

          DROPS IT IN THE SINK. The drug spills into the water,

          when he walks in. Everyone CHEERS. BURT moves right
          behind him, all smiles. Joseph is thrilled--but somehow
          not the same. His face doesn't look bad, but one eye is a
          different color from the other, and he's had reconstructive
          surgery on his jaw. There is, of course, a scar, and he's
          lost a lot of weight.

          other faces we can recognize from around the precinct stand
          back, all smiles. AD-LIB HELLOS. An elderly NEIGHBOR

</b>          The two brothers make eye contact. The crowd quiets a bit.
          Bobby smiles at the sight of his brother. Joseph gets
          emotional, too:

          looks on, pleased, Bobby takes his hand and grips the back
          of Joseph's neck. Joseph pulls his brother to him by his
          neck. A real embrace. Joseph pats Bobby's back.

          into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question:

          up a storm. She is having a GREAT TIME, surrounded by many
          would-be male suitors and Louis. She is laughing and
          stoned, and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free.
          As she moves, she pushes the men away with a smile. All,
          of course, except for Louis. Louis dances a CAN CAN with
          two amused girls. Though fat, he's surprisingly graceful.

          at her, she averts his gaze. Burt changes course:
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Burt warms slightly, too. A beat, then the CARS PULL UP.
          Bobby looks at his father with real feeling. Burt eyes
          him, then touches Bobby's cheek, a truly loving gesture:

          her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view
          through the windshield of his father's car.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby's driver, Vitt, follows Burt down the streets. RAIN
          is FALLING frighteningly HARD, to the point where the
          windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water
          on the windshield. Upsetting. Visibility's terrible.
<b>          
</b>          The cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop. The traffic
          is sparse this early morning. We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP
          of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. And we HEAR
          the steady, haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the
          wheels of the automobiles. Bobby puts his arm around
          Rosario, in the back seat. Re the rain:

</b>          Bobby does not answer, instead spots an OLDSMOBILE driving
          alongside his vehicle. Seems a bit suspicious, the way

          HEAR the SHOT. The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of
          nowhere. The windshield cracks down the middle...
          VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER, and he lets out a piercing
          cry. Blood hits the seat. Rosario screams. Bobby pushes
          her head down, into the back seat.
<b>          
</b>          THE CAR starts to swerve. Bobby climbs awkwardly over to
          the front seat. Takes the WHEEL, forcefully pulling Vitt
          to the side. To Rosario:

          THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes
          up against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that
          protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred
          feet below.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby darts from lane to lane, and the THIRD POLICE CAR--
          behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting
          Bobby's car...
<b>          
</b>          THE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURT'S CAR.      BOBBY SEES the

<b>          
</b>          ANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound... The
          water slides away, REVEALING that the back window of Burt's
          car has shattered.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping
          open. He CAN SEE:
<b>          
</b>          HIS FATHER, FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS.
          We HEAR BURT through the RADIO, a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL:

</b>          Bobby pulls up alongside the Olds. Looks inside. He tries
          to get a good look but cannot. He SEES TWO people in the
          car, one driving and one doing the shooting--
<b>          
</b>          BOOM!   And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobby's rear

          the Olds. This is unbelievably dangerous.
<b>          
</b>          A TRUCK starts changing lanes. The Olds scoots past it
          before it does, but: Burt does not. THE TRUCK CLIPS Burt's
          car on the driver's side. He sneaks through, recovering
          and keeping up the pursuit.

          JACKNIFES, spinning out. The Police Car behind Bobby's
          slams into the truck, making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND.
<b>          
</b>          BOBBY'S EYES, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific
          accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window. It is
<b>          TERRIBLE:

</b>          The truck CRUSHES the Police car, its carriage flipping
          over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people
          inside.
<b>          
</b>          The Olds skids ferociously, pulling off the expressway
          toward city streets. Burt's car follows. Burt's car and
          the Olds are neck-and-neck. Bobby pulls up beside Burt.
          Into the radio:

</b><b>          
</b>          Sitting on the couch is Joseph. He is trying to be stoic,
          but appears wan and tired. Alone. We HEAR the crowd in
          the house, but they are in the living room. A KNOCK: Bobby
          enters.
<b>

</b>                    Joseph?
<b>          
</b>          Joseph eyes him, seems heartened by the sight of his
          brother. But he is out of it, emotionally bludgeoned:
<b>          
</b><b>                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
</b>                    ...I'll catch `em, Bobby. Don't
                    worry...
<b>          
</b>          Bobby walks over to Joseph, stands close to him.   Searches
          for words. Before he can speak:
<b>          
</b><b>                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
</b>                    They're gonna need us to identify
                    the body...
<b>          
</b>          Then, as emotional as we've yet seen him, Bobby strains to
          get the sentences out of his mouth:
<b>          
</b><b>                                   BOBBY GREEN
</b>                    I don't know if I can do that.   I

</b>                    I saw him die...
<b>          
</b>          Bobby breaks down. Joseph responds by CLUTCHING him
          tightly. The brothers rock back and forth gently.
<b>          
</b><b>                                    BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)

</b>          The shot is of a small and bare room in a Queens funeral
          home. In the center is a COFFIN. The camera DOLLIES
          TOWARD IT. Entering the room is an UNDERTAKER, with Bobby
          and Joseph right behind.

</b>          The Undertaker unhinges the coffin. Inside is Burt, eyes
          closed, clothed in a suit. We don't see the body; what we
          DO see are the reactions of his two sons. Bobby's grief is
          obvious, but he's already seen him dead. This is new
          territory for Joseph, who though he does not break down,
          seems overwhelmed. Both young men nod in acknowledgement,
          and the Undertaker closes the coffin.

          WATCHES him from behind, as his hand runs along the top of

</b>          A LIMOUSINE pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of
          tombstones. Emerging are Bobby and Joseph. They are both
          wearing dark sunglasses. Rosario and Sandra and the
          children get out behind them and are led away by funeral
          coordinators to another place in the coming processional.
          In the distance, many many people and a long line of cars
          move toward the two brothers.
<b>          
</b>          The Undertaker walks away briefly, to direct some traffic.
          Bobby slowly puts his arm around Joseph's waist, prompting:

<b>

          to Bobby, clears his throat. Sotto:

</b>          Bobby is surprised to hear this admission, and is taken

<b>          
</b><b>          MINUTES LATER.
</b><b>          
</b>          A line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the HEARSE.
          The procession is PHENOMENALLY LONG. The New York skyline
          is in the distance.
<b>          
</b>          UNIFORMED POLICE LINE the narrow road. The COFFIN is
          removed from the HEARSE, put on WHEELS for the move to the
          gravesite. Bobby, Joseph approach. The DRUMS CONTINUE:

</b><b>          BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...
</b><b>          
</b>          People get out of their cars. Many of them we recognize
          from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of
          the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and
          his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE, KALINA.
<b>          
</b>          The walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph.
<b>          
</b>          Behind them, the Mayor, the Commissioner, all the rank and
          file of the Force. The turnout is enormous. Rosario is
          here too, though several rows back. She is with the women.
<b>          
</b>          Bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds
          of SALUTING COPS, others. AMONG THEM, we SPOT:
<b>          
</b><b>          LOUIS FALSETTI.
</b><b>          
</b>          At that moment, BOBBY SEES his old friend, and the two make
          EYE CONTACT. Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and
          nods subtly to Jumbo. Louis salutes gently, a slight and
          sympathetic smile coming across his face...
<b>          
</b>          SIMULTANEOUS: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN, grows more
          distraught. He breaks down. Bobby is there to catch him
          and does.

          TALKING ABOUT HER. Though she can't hear what they're

          behind them. Bobby SEES: BEYOND THE CEMETARY GROUNDS:
          TEENAGERS have climbed the trees. And they're LAUGHING at
          the spectacle. Michael stands next to Bobby.
<b>          
</b>          A beat, then Bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied.
          Almost as if the words are more for himself than for Mike:

          "WELCOME TO THE FORCE." Bobby thanks them, then moves to
          stand behind his brother. Michael testily grills Jack on

          mood and instead starts a melee. He is a tour de force of
          energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue
          him. The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything

          rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM
          for GOOD. THE DOOR SLAMS. A SILENT BEAT. Bobby paces, in

          REPEATEDLY. Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the
          wall, AND IT SHATTERS... Exhausted, he stops. Moves to:

          BLOOD on his hand. He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE. He
          throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the
          realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over
          him. Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs.

</b>          It is as though all of the emotions in our story find their
          outlet here, in this moment. Bobby lets all the remaining
          feeling drain from him until he has nothing left.

          heavily. A beat; he puts his bloodied hand to his head...

          They open the back, FILLED WITH FURS. They take a number
          of coats out of the BACK OF THE VAN, bring them to the
          shack...

          ANOTHER TOWN CAR. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand around the auto.

          helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other.
          They KISS WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the
          devastation. Almost to himself:

          back of the car. They do not get out. They seem clueless.
<b>          
</b>          STANDING GUARD over all of this is a LOOKOUT, who is armed
          with an AK-47. Several other ARMED MEN take positions
          closer to the structure as the FURS ARE BROUGHT IN.
<b>

</b>          Bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. The weeds
          separate, REVEALING NEZHINSKI, with a look on his face that
          registers a kind of shock, a shock that he's been hit.
          Nezhinski sees Bobby standing over him. With all the
          energy he has in the world:

<b>

<b>          
</b>          BOBBY TAKES A THREATENING STEP FORWARD. Bobby's expression
          seems unmatched in its ferocity; Marat sees in Bobby's eyes
          a horrible determination, begins to cry... Bobby's
          emotions are a CAULDRON:

</b>          Marat gets on his knees. WHIMPERING. Bobby puts Marat's
          hands on his head, starts PATTING HIM DOWN. CLEAN.

</b>          BOBBY PUTS THE SHOTGUN AT MARAT'S TEMPLE.    We HEAR the

<b>          
</b>          The police see the unforgiving expression on Bobby's face
          and the reality of the old man in front of them. Bobby
          turns to the others, particularly JACK. He looks at him,
          dark-eyed. Then he turns away and starts walking, making
          eye contact with none of them. He utters a command, to all
          of them and none of them in particular:

<b>          
</b>          Bobby walks past the small building, which CONTINUES TO
          BURN SILENTLY--with that eerie BLUE FLAME... Other cops
          watch him with awe and respect. They back away from him.
          He proceeds on toward the cars.

          standing in the crowd behind the seated audience. Her face
          is partially obscured. BOBBY CANNOT BELIEVE THE FLOOD OF
          EMOTION that overwhelms him, the happiness he feels upon
          catching a glimpse of her.
<b>          
</b>          But just as quickly as this thrill grabs him, it disappears
          when she becomes completely visible; for he realizes that
          IT IS NOT HER but rather a young woman who bears merely a
          faint resemblance... Joseph interrupts this, leans over:

          Joseph in front. The POLICE BAND begins to play the drums.
          Bobby straightens up, raises his hand--along with the sea
          of blue--in a SALUTE as the flag is carried to the front.
