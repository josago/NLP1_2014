</b>
    Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
    road. A car chugs over the horizon.

</b>              As far as con man stories go,
              I think I've heard them all.
              Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
              tales drawn long and tall.
              But if one bears a bookmark in
              the confidence man's tome,
              twould be that of Penelope,
              and of the brothers Bloom.

</b>
    The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
    country house.

    Both in black.   Each with a suitcase.

<b>                        NARRATOR
</b>              At ten and thirteen Bloom and
              Stephen (the younger and the old)

    The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
    breakfast.

</b>              had been through several foster
              families.

    The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
    LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
    crap out of him.

              Thirty eight, all told.

    "Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
    by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch
    different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE",

                 moving kept them close.

    The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.

</b>                 For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
                 Bloom, and both had more than most.

    The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
    brothers suspiciously.


<b>6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6
</b>
    A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.

<b>                           NARRATOR
</b>                 Another home, another main street.
                 Stephen looked around,
                 then summed the burgh up thusly:

<b>                           STEPHEN
</b>                 Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.

<b>                           NARRATOR
</b>                 One theater. One car wash. One
                 cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
                 through some mishap, had one leg.

    The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
    with its one leg.

<b>                           STEPHEN
</b>                 Sweet Jesus. Look at that.

    A group of children flee the school joyfully.

<b>                           NARRATOR
</b>                 One school, which meant one tight-
                 knit group of local well-off kids.

     The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
     Pops.

     Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a
     scowl.

     The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.

<b>                           NARRATOR
</b>                 They were the `they'. All well
                 loved, rooted, happy as you please.

     Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
     happy nursing their Pixie Stix.

                 Always there. In every town.

     Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.

     He storms off.    Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
     children.

     The brothers amble down a wooded path.     Bloom stops, staring
     into the trees.

     Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
     And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
     patch in the leaves.

     Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
     Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.

     Bloom gazes.    Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.


<b>12   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS                                       12
</b>
     Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
     shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
     all now from the playing kids and the girl.

<b>                         NARRATOR
</b>               Could he simply

<b>                         STEPHEN (O.S.)
</b>               Talk to her!

<b>                         NARRATOR
</b>               Just drop his fears and go? Leave
               his brother in the woods, and join
               the children?

     The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
     her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.

     He turns tail and runs back into the woods.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
               No.

     Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-
     wise, shuffling a pack of cards.

<b>                         BLOOM

<b>                            STEPHEN
</b>                  Not a thing.

<b>                            NARRATOR
</b>                  This wasn't really true.
                  Cause in the root of Stephen's
                  psyche, something now began.
                  A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
                  A tale.

<b>                            STEPHEN
</b>                  A plan.

     Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
     talks Bloom through it.

<b>                            NARRATOR
</b>                  A fiction made for profit, in which
                  both boys played a part.
                  A simple con in fifteen steps.

<b>                            STEPHEN
</b>                  And this is where we start.

     Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
     each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... "Bloom Talks To
     Girl"

     Children and the gold haired Girl playing.      The wall of
     foliage where the forest begins shimmers.

<b>                            NARRATOR
</b>                  And then, as if a curtain had been
                  pulled back from the sky...
                  Some barrier within the younger
                  Bloom was broken.

     Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
     lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
     the girl.

     Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
     kids, suddenly a natural born charmer.

</b>                  And being who he wasn't, could be

     The Golden Girl smiles at him.

     From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
     pleased. He slinks away.

                  the filthy red-eyed leech... and
                  said he'd tell for thirty bucks.

     Something in Bloom's face falls.

     The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of

     In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of

     Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.

     The children gasp collectively.    The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.

     Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.

     The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which
     hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
     recedes deeper into the gloom.

     With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.

     scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,

     Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
     young man folds to the ground.

     A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while
     behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.

<b>                            THE TURK
</b>                  One thing baffles me. The entire
                  con would have fallen apart if
                  Charleston had walked away. How did
                  you know he'd pull the trigger?

     Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.

<b>                            STEPHEN
</b>                  Just think of any card.    Got one?

     Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.

<b>                               THE TURK
</b>                  No.

     Stephen shrugs.

<b>                            STEPHEN
</b>                  But if I do it enough, eventually
                  it'll work on someone. And then
                  it'll be the best card trick in the
                  world.

     Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks
     a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.

                               STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Ante up.

     She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.

</b>               Our fifth Beatle. She knows the

               English.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>               Just till the wind changes.

     Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.

     She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
     bullet bouncing off her.

<b>                         THE TURK
</b>               Where is Bloom?

     In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
     velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
     with a queen of hearts he can't play.

     A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
     through the curtains.

<b>                         ROSE

</b>               I'm not going to tell it as good as
               Stephen. You two kicked around
               till your early teens, then stowed
               away on a merchant marine freighter
               and ended up in St. Petersburg,
               where you spent five years under
               the tutelage of a shadowy old
               swindler named the Diamond Dog.
               And he was your Fagin and Stephen
               was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
               suddenly and badly.

<b>                         BLOOM
</b>               Stephen took his eye out with an
               antique rapier.

<b>                         ROSE
</b>               Why did he do that?

<b>                         BLOOM

               on their own to make their fortune

               romantic.

<b>                          ROSE
</b>               It does.

     She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
     table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
     kiss.

     Bloom's eyes stay open.

     A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.

<b>                         BLOOM (O.S.)
</b>               He positioned me in the same spot
               where, seven years ago,
               Charleston's wife stood and told
               him she was leaving.

     The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
     ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He chose my outfit to mirror her
               suit.

     Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
     Wife's outfit.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He even phonetically matched my
               final words to hers.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>               This is the end. Charelston, you've
               always been a dunce.

               novels, with thematic arcs and
               imbedded symbolism and shit. And

     He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
     towards the exit, passing Stephen.

     Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND
     YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.

     Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
     bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.

     Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
     across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
     him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
     face.

     He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
     his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
     hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
     smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.

     As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.

     Stephen paces out into the street.

     Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers
     stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom
     trailing behind, lost in thought.

     Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it.
     Stephen throws open the wall's gate.

     Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen
     cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.

                  At least you're honest.

                  Alright, let's do this. Let's just
                  get it done. So first you say `I'm
                  quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then
                  I say...

<b>                            BLOOM

                  have come to your senses'

     Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.

     Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of
     Ferentino.

     A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It
     winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.

     The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.   The red
     car's bumper pulls up, parks.

     On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
     of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
     owner heads for the apartment door.

     Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.

     A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
     light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
     window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.

     Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
     extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.

     A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
     berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.

     Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother
     follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the
     last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the
     cheek and sends them off.

     Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The
     illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to
     a plaster deer in the front yard.

     The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just
     when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros.

     Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red
     Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut
     and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of
     dust and smoke.

     Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the
     dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a
     non-Lamborghini way.

     Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.

     In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new

                  Controversial choice. So no, is
                  what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway.
                  I'll be in Italy. Drinking.

     The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope
     drag a harp around into the back yard.

     watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.

     Stephen spots something and blows a whistle.       With a grunt,
     Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.

     Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the
     steep steep hill.

     At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.      Cruising down
     the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.

     Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.

     through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood

     the wheel.

     Several things happen at once.

     Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.      The bent bike
     follows suit.

     Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9
     and 5.6.

     The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.

     Everything is still.

     Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts
     and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then
     jolts and stops.

     Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as
     us.

     One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward,
     veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to

     Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen,
     neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.

     This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on
     Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts,
     then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again
     and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it

                  the dusty shop we worked nine to

<b>                            PENELOPE
</b>                  When I turned six I started getting
                  allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
                  bad. So my mom took me into the
                  doctor, and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins, to see which ones you're
                  allergic to. The next day I came
                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-
                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic
                  to everything. So they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system, and I spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

     She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
     the table.

               the hypodermic needle was made out

     Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.

<b>                         PENELOPE
</b>               The trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat. So I
               decided this wasn't a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated. It was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything, any little
               thing. And do anything she decided
               to do. And love the person she was
               trapped with. So I told myself
               that story until it became true.
               Now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life, or did it just blind
               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
               I don't know. But either way, I
               was the one telling my own story.
               So I don't feel cheated.

     She finishes the trick.

     A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.

     and away.

                  It's been such a time since I've

     The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand.

                  A little fear might suit you, I

     which he delicately employs.

                  Bon soir, ma cherie.

     He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
     teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
     air, the Bolero suits it.

     The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in

                  top of our art dealing game, she
                  just appeared.

     A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his
     place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette.

                            BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  She's stuck with us. We figure
                  when she gets bored she'll vanish
                  with the same lack of noise.

     Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She
     drinks it without looking at him.

     Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the
     Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed
     ATTENDANT runs past.

      He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the

                   My daughter travelled with me when
                   she was very young, and I'd show
                   her the places and the art, all the
                   most joyous and terrifying things
                   in the world.

      Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the
      sun.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   I wanted that the world was alive
                   in the most fantastic way for her.
                   To built her a pair of wings. Make
                   these things real. But maybe more
                   than any other objet d'art, she
                   loved to hear she'd ask to hear the
                   story of the stone golem. From a
                   painting in a small private
                   collection on the island of Ikaria.

      He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells
      the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still
      images, which we move across like a picture book.

                And one day the boy was walking
                home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
                with a good friend of his. They
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died. The boy's friend was very
                sad but also very frightened. So
                instead of telling the boy's
                parents, he did something awful.
                He pulled the body into a quarry, a
                pit of broken rocks, and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones.
                Well. Years went by, and the boy's
                friend became a young man, and one
                day while drinking in town (which
                in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest... with the
                stones from the quarry. He ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty... no stones, no body. He
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work. `Did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
                hoping they'd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot. But no,
                they said, motioning to the well.
                Nothing strange. Just stones.
                They left him alone there at the
                well, and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep, still silence.

      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.

      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows.

      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.

      Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
      Curator, sitting very still.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                My daughter died nineteen years ago

                but slipped and broke my leg, and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms.
                If you've had a child... my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing, to hold her and make her
                feel safe. But no matter what I
                said to her, I couldn't stop her
                shaking, crying. Her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror. Of a stone golem.

                   terrified. C'mon now, look. Take
                   a look. I'm an old man with no
                   depth perception. You don't have
                   to be scared of me.

      The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   It's been a funny thing, watching
                   you boys take what I taught you and
                   eclipse me. I'm so proud to be a
                   footnote in the lives of the
                   Brothers Bloom. And you hate me.
                   The curse of all bad fathers - that
                   my presence on this earth after I
                   die will not live on the lips of
                   admiring men, but will sink into
                   the murky backwaters of my
                   children's psyches.

<b>                             BLOOM
</b>                   Is this profundity?   Cause you can
                   skip it.

<b>                              DIAMOND DOG
</b>                   Ha!   Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.

      The Dog scoots next to Bloom.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   When I first took you boys in,
                   showed you the ropes, haunting St.
                   Pete's, piss and vinegar. I still
                   crave that youthful joy. Even
                   today.

      The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg.     There is something
      horrible about this.

      Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.

<b>                             BLOOM
</b>                   Don't touch me.

<b>                             DIAMOND DOG
</b>                   You probably won't believe I loved
                   you boys very much.

</b>                You're going to take your hand away
                or I'm going to break your arm,
                there's nothing between.

      He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.

<b>                          DIAMOND DOG
</b>                But love, you know. We know, folks

                fall. That's the price of our

                tell you what to do and protect
                you. When he's gone, remember me.

      The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on
      his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.

      Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-

      When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand.
      Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog.

                          DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                Hello Stephen.

      Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across
      the Dog's hand.

      Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his
      bleeding hand. Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his
      pocket.

      Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes. For
      an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy
      behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his
      arm around him.

      The Mercedes drives off.

      Right in front of the hotel, on the water. Bloom sips coffee
      from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands. Stephen
      joins him, with a matching cup.

      A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming
      through the wall. Penelope snoring.

      Bloom smiles slightly.   What a cute snore.

      The snoring deepens slightly.

      The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and
      through the window the horizon glows with the approach of
      dawn.

      Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open,
      the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.

      Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.

      And totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls.

      The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the
      well... broken on the floor.

      Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness.
      Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.

      Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
      stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.

      build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit
      off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
      detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.

      on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.

      Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table.     Going over the
      floorplan one more time.

      He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
      bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an
      open handbag on the table.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Is this Yeungling's backpack?

<b>                            BLOOM
</b>                Yeah.

      She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
      the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish
      bomb beside the handbag.

<b>                          PENELOPE

      The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
      other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in
      this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer
      we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.

      An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink
      walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She
      goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.

      They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots
      off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.

</b>                   Because going in alone is a very

                   walking into a zero security
                   tourism office during a fire drill
                   and taking a five hundred dollar
                   manuscript replica from a utility
                   crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a
                   file clerk asks if she's lost.
                   Which isn't even going to happen.
                       (to the Chink)
                   She's in position.

      He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.

      Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin.
      She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.

      She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the
      handbag dangling at her hip.

                   Cause nobody's going to know we

      A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk
      out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully
      dramatic ball of fire and debris.

      Screams.   Shouts.      Panic.

      Our three look up at the tower, agape.

      Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.

      The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth,
      fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.

      She dashes into the door.

      Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a
      SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.

      Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army
      helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway,
      helpless and scared.

      barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic
      bag, hangs from her teeth.

      Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.

      Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she

      Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens'
      "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.

      His eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit
      seller's cart.

      He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing
      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.

      Holy shit.    He is going to steal that apple.

      Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
      turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.

      And turns.

      And sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite
      judgement.

      Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.

      The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and
      screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,
      apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.

      As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window

      two mini bottles of gin.

      Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.

      Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.

      Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
      Bloom's leg and brings him down.

      Then they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified.

      A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
      apart, thirty years worth of a fight.

      Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.

      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.

      And goes off with a deafening rapport.

      Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.

      Penelope screams.

      Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of
      blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.

<b>                          STEPHEN
</b>                Tastes like tin foil.

      And sinks to the ground.

      Bloom's eyes glaze.    He crawls to his brother.   Takes him in
      his arms.

<b>                             BLOOM
</b>                I'm sorry.

      Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in
      her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not
      being a part of this moment.

      Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize
      her.

      For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms
      in the middle of the broken room.

      Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope
      walking off into the distance down the beach.

      From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a
      mask.

      Stephen stands.   Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and
      blood packets.

      Bloom steps outside.

      sand.

      Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.

      At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope
      sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.

      After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's
      written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.

      Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the

      She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and
      slides it across the table to him.

      On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized
      fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."

      curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back
      by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair
      holds his tear stained face in his hands.

      This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell

      Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his
      fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.

      Goes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila
      envelope.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   We're going to find him. If he

      Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.

      A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,
      loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands
      outside.

<b>                             BLOOM
</b>                   Stephen, god please what's

                   Please. What's happening. Please.

      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.

      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.

<b>                             PENELOPE

      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.

      She sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in.

                   No, please. Not now. I need your

      The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the
      world. But she's leaving.

      She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching
      for an instant.

      She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
      her case and walks off.

      A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
      in.

      Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in
      Chinese.

                               BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Thanks.

      The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
      dramatic fireball.

      The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
      and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.

      Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just
      happened.

      Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila
      folder - addresses, pictures, information...

      A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it.       An address in
      St. Petersburg.

      The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on.      The third box
      - "The End."

                   What do we do now?

      Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten
      life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.

<b>                             BLOOM

      Bloom goes to the Bug.

                   apartment in St. Petersburg. So

      Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door,

      Bloom spins, gun drawn.      Penelope screams.

      Then a moment of stillness.       The shotgun barrel quivers.

      It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's
      Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.

      Penelope approaches him slowly.

      Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two
      things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black

      She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.

      A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes
      through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope
      with glass.

      Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the
      impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.

      The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.

</b>                I'm so scared. Anything I can

      Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door.

      No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.      Bloom
      steps lightly, deeper into the theater.

<b>                           BLOOM

      A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the
      broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.

      Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.

<b>                           BLOOM
</b>                Stephen!

      A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's
      face. He spins, trapped in its glare.

      A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.

      When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few
      feet ahead of him towards the stage.

      Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.

      With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.

      Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high
      above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged
      forms of light and black.

      Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly
      lighting Stephen's face.

      Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.

      Bloom cries and rushes towards him...

      He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind
      him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.

<b>                             BLOOM
</b>                   Stephen, who is it?   Is it the Dog?

</b>                   They're calling to check right now.
                   Don't move. I'm alright.

      The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear
      for a moment then flips it closed.

      Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily
      stands, cut loose.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm
                   coming to you.

      He takes a couple wobbly steps.

      Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
      towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...

      And the utility lamp switches off.

<b>                              BLOOM
</b>                   No!

      Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into
      the blackness.

      Stephen drops flat to the ground.

      The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,
      strobing the scene like stage lightning.

      Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen
      lies on his stomach out in the open.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)

      But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,
      unloading three more rounds into the dark.

      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.

      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.

      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.

      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him.

      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
      through the torn backdrop.

      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby.

      Silence.

      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.

      face.

      Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.

      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes
      them, wipes blood from his lip.

      Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.

      Now a dark shade of brown.

                   there. They hadn't cleared out of
                   their apartment, they had been
                   cleared out.

      RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men
      with silenced pistols.

      The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.

</b>                   Real Russians. Took his store.
                   They didn't know about his deal
                   with us, but you haggled with them.
                   You really sold the book to real
                   Russians. The Diamond Dog was
                   gone.

      The scene beside the lake, our four heroes checking the money
      in the attache case.

</b>                Let's get the hell out of Russia.

      Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.    We
      follow it, plunging beneath the surface.

      Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
      sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.

                Stephen...

      Penelope holds him tight.

</b>                I know.

</b>                He's gone.

      Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
      She holds his crying face up.

<b>                          PENELOPE
</b>                And he did it so you could live.
                Your brother loved you. He loved
                you so much. Look at me. Stephen
                said something once, I got the
                feeling he'd rather be telling it
                to you. He said there's no such
                thing as an unwritten life. Just
                badly written ones. I love you.

      She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
      smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.

      Bloom watches her.

      Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
      holds out her hand for him to follow.

</b>                   I was thinking of something Stephen
                   said too. "The perfect con is one
                   where everyone involved gets just
                   the thing they wanted." Well.

      He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
      of light breaking over the hill.

      Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead.
      The rumbly old VW chugs away from us, towards the horizon.
