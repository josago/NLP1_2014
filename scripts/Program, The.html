</b>                         Allright, bowl bid ridin' here for 
                         E.S.U. Fourth down on the Georgia 
                         Tech 18. 4 ticks left. Kane sets 'em 
                         down.

<b>                                                            INSTANT CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               LINE OF TAPED KNUCKLES - NIGHT
</b>
               smashing into the mud, as a football OFFENSIVE LINE comes 
               set, frosted breath steaming across to:

               The DEFENSIVE LINE digging in, ready to explode.

<b>               CLOSE ON JOE KANE
</b>
               E.S.U. quarterback, barking signals. The ball is snapped, 
               and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the 
               slop.

               Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE 
               END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by, 
               grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is 
               closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass 
               toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him 
               face-down in the swamp.

               We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY 
               GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two 
               DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing 
               as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The 
               ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes 
               to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete. 
               The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION.

               Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then 
               drops his head in defeat.

<b>               ANGLE ON SAM WINTERS
</b>
               Betraying little emotion, Coach SAM WINTERS, wiry, intense, 
               early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across 
               the field.

<b>                                     REPORTER #1 (V.O.)
</b>                         Coach, this is the second year in a 
                         row you've failed to go to a bowl 
                         game. Do you feel your program's in 
                         decline?

<b>               INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Coach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by 
               reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face.

<b>                                     WINTERS
</b>                              (keeping his cool)
                         No, we're just a young team on the 
                         verge. We'll be back in a major bowl 
                         next year.

               Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud-
               splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his 
               locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes 
               danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, 
               a sense of repressed anger off it.

<b>                                     ALVIN
</b>                         Good throw, Joe. It was there.

<b>                                     JOE
</b>                         So was half their team.
                              (trailing off)
                         Shit, another Christmas at home.

<b>                                     ALVIN
</b>                         Next year, man. Next year we sell 
                         out. Next year we dominate.

<b>               ON COACH WINTERS AGAIN
</b>
               still fielding questions.

<b>                                     REPORTER #2
</b>                         You still need a deep threat or a 
                         breakaway back to go with Joe Kane. 
                         What are you gonna do to address 
                         this need?

<b>                                     COACH WINTERS
</b>                              (a little edgy)
                         Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you 
                         guys for a start.

               As Winters gets up to go, we hear:

<b>                                     WILSON (V.O.)
</b>                         I'm not gonna lead you into the fog 
                         here, Sam...

<b>               INT. CHANCELLOR WILSON'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               CHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind 
               his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN 
               HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director.

<b>                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON
</b>                         I'm concerned about our Program. 
                         It's always been a source of pride 
                         to our students and alumni, but two 
                         straight so-so seasons are having a 
                         damaging effect on our fund-raising, 
                         both public and private.

<b>                                     WINTERS
</b>                              (half-joking)
                         Then stop raising the entrance 
                         requirements on me. We never could 
                         have gotten Alvin Mack in here under 
                         the new guidelines.

<b>                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON
</b>                         As Chancellor, my first responsibility 
                         is to the academic interests of this 
                         University.

               Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed 
               to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is 
               marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is 
<b>               $400,000,000.
</b>
<b>                                     WILSON
</b>                         At a time when we're committed to a 
                         400 million dollar building program, 
                         alumni donations are down 15% the 
                         last two years. Because they've also 
                         voiced their displeasure to their 
                         legislators, we can expect a 
                         corresponding drop in state funds.

</b>                         The Athletic Fund is suffering too. 
                         Season tickets sales are off, 
                         merchandising's slow...

<b>                                     WINTERS
</b>                         You layin' all this at my door? 
                         There's been a recession on.

<b>                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON
</b>                         Yes, but the heaviest drop has been 
                         from the big donors, the 100,000 
                         dollar club. These people are 
                         recession proof. They sit in my box 
                         every game, and they're much more 
                         generous when we're ranked and going 
                         to bowl games. Two of them, as you 
                         know, are on the Board of Regents, 
                         including the Chairman.

<b>                                     WINTERS
</b>                         What are you trying to say to me, 
                         Grant? After 12 years, my job's in 
                         jeopardy?

<b>                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON
</b>                         I'm not prepared to discuss your job 
                         right now; I just want you to be 
                         aware of the situation. The alumni 
                         and the legislature are unhappy and 
                         they vote with their checkbooks. I 
                         don't pretend to be an expert on 
                         football, Sam, and I'll deny that 
                         this conversation ever took place, 
                         but I do know we need to win next 
                         year.

<b>               INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches, HUMES and 
               CLAYTON, walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to 
               a waiting car. At the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow EFFIGY 
               of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe.

<b>                                     CLAYTON
</b>                              (ignoring the effigy)
                         Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary 
                         and player profiles are in your 
                         briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow 
                         in Philly with this kid Darnell 
                         Jefferson.

               Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy. Humes and Clayton 
               fear an outburst, a display of rage.

<b>                                     WINTERS
</b>                         Looks like I've lost weight.

               That's it. He strides on. Humes and Clayton race to catch 
               up.

<b>                                     CLAYTON
</b>                         This kid's the gamebreaker we've

               A Boeing 737 roars into the night sky.

<b>                                     COACH CLAYTON (V.O.)
</b>                         Had a 108 yard kickoff return against 
                         Taft. Michigan's been down to see 
                         him twice.

<b>               INT. ST. LUKE'S HOME FOR BOYS - MORNING
</b>
               Winters, Humes, Clayton and Joe Kane sit across from DARNELL 
               JEFFERSON and REVEREND WALLACE in a tattered parlor room. 
               Other boys of various ages and color look in from the 
               adjoining door. Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip, 
               the letters D.J. shaved in block letters into his fade.

<b>                                     WINTERS
</b>                         Darnell, you have the potential to 
                         start for us as a freshman. That 108 
                         yard kickoff return you made against 
                         Taft? One of the greatest runs I've 
                         ever seen a high school player make. 
                         Now, Michigan is set at tailback for 
                         two years. You won't play till you're 
                         a junior. With Joe here gettin' you 
                         the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right, 
                         you'll be All-American with us as a 
                         Sophomore.

<b>                                     REVEREND WALLACE
</b>                         Yes, but I'm really more concerned 
                         with Darnell's education. He came 
                         here late. He's got some catching up 
                         to do.

<b>                                     WINTERS
</b>                         Believe me, education is the first 
                         priority in our program. That's why 
                         all the players are smarter than me. 
                         After all, a football coach is smart 
                         enough to understand the game, but 
                         dumb enough to think it's important.

               This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend. It was intended 
               to.

               Winters' daughter LOUANNE, 20, is on the phone with her 
               father. Louanne is sexy, clothes too tight, but good-natured, 
               somewhat needy and loyal as a labrador. She holds a hopelessly 
               out-of-style sweater her dad's given her for Christmas.

               Joe sits on the couch with his older brother, FRANK, watching 
               the bowl game he would have been in, had E.S.U. won their 
               last game. His FATHER, a grizzled man in his fifties, nods 
               in and out in a tattered armchair. All three have been 
               drinking beer, their empties scattered around. Frank tosses 
               Joe an Iron City beer.

               As Joe's father heads for the kitchen, he hangs his empty

               Joe leads Darnell down to the end of the tunnel, where Autumn 
               is waiting. He introduces them. She's even more attractive 
               than Darnell thought she'd be.

               She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field 
               where he's greeted by the E.S.U. BAND playing the school 
               fight song. The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking, 
               pom-poms whirling.

               The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat 
               stadium, an awesome sight for any young man. Autumn points 
               to the giant DIAMOND VISION SCOREBOARD. Darnell's name and

               Darnell, in his excitement, does a little end-zone dance.

               He leans down to kiss her. She hesitates, not sure about 
               this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to 
               let it deepen, then breaks it off.

               Bud takes a good-natured swipe at him. Lattimer deflects it.

               Joe notices Bobby looking over at Louanne. She gives Bobby a 
               surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her. He 
               gives her the "just a minute" sign.

               The crowd from the 911 (Bud, Alvin, Lattimer, Darnell, Bobby 
               and Louanne) follow Joe down the hill behind the bar toward 
               a busy two-lane highway. Joe, a little drunker than the 
               others, starts HOWLING at the moon like a Timber Wolf. The 
               others join in.

                         wake up our Mojo. Start settin' the

                         anything. You're in no shape...

               Suddenly Joe makes a dash out onto the highway.

                         doin' shit like this? Coach'll fuckin'

                         motherfucker.

               Joe stands on the white line, cars and trucks whizzing by, 
               then lies down on his back, arms at his side.

<b>               JOE'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
               Cars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of 
               us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt.

               Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly 
               worried now.

<b>                                     BUD
</b>                         Fuck this shit.

               Pissed off, Bud sprints out to the white line. The draft-
               wake of a passing truck almost blows him over.

<b>                                     BUD
</b>                         C'mon, Joe, that's enough. Let's get 
                         the hell outa here. What if somebody 
                         drifts or crosses the line to pass?

</b>                         What's the matter, Bud? Can't you 
                         follow?

               Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.

                         God-damnit, god-damnit. Shit.

               Bud can't fight it. He lies down on the line, his head 
               touching Joe's feet. Joe begins to HOWL again. Bud joins in. 
               Alvin and the others can't believe it.

                         Defense out there.

               Bobby and Lattimer look at each other a beat. Time to ante 
               up. Both turn to Alvin.

<b>                                     ALVIN

                         you're bad?

               Alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop. 
               Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow. Louanne grabs Bobby, 
               holds him back.

<b>                                     LOUANNE
</b>                              (vaguely sexual)
                         Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be 
                         careful.

               Bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a 
               long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line, 
               leaving her breathless.

               Alvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud. Now 
               there's a line of five, a human highway median. Everybody 
               scared shitless, howling their lungs out.

               Louanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road.

                         They never mentioned this in 
                         recruiting.

               Finally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble 
               back to safety. Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange 
               exhilarated high fives. Alvin just shakes his head.

               Twenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are 
               scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in 
               test booklets, as a PROCTOR paces the room. Darnell starts 
               to write an answer, stops, stumped. Worried, he looks at the 
               clock, goes on to the next page.

<b>               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING
</b>
               Darnell and Joe walk across campus. Darnell carries a 
               gleaming, chromed TROPHY with a football player on top. He's 
               still thinking about the test.

                         for.

               Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad.

               Joe starts to protest, but Darnell is already off, racing 
               across the Quad, quickly catching up with Autumn.

</b>                         I wanna talk a little about what 
                         we're trying to do here. There are 
                         many highly respected people who 
                         feel football is about preparation 
                         for life.

               The players nod reverentially at this established axiom of 
               the football cannon.

                         see, football is not like life.
                              (pause)
                         It's better. More exciting, more 
                         intense, more fun. In life, people 
                         are always wondering how they measure 
                         up; whether they're getting ahead or 
                         fallin' behind. In football, you 
                         know. Every week you get a chance to 
                         show what you're made of, a chance 
                         to demonstrate the physical and 
                         personal qualities that all those 
                         poor bastards who can't play this 
                         game are left to agonize about.

               Spreading smiles all around. It's good to be a football 
               player.

                         felt we let the school down. Fuck

               Scrimmage. Joe hands off to Darnell. He sweeps right, cuts 
               it up, blows past the end. In a spectacular display of broken 
               field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back, 
               eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. Alvin, 
               pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping 
               the ball at the same time. There's a wild scramble for the 
               fumble. Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense 
               recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run.

               The players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground,

               Darnell's stung by this. He'd like to think of himself as 
               capable of more.

               Suddenly, Coach Winters appears at the door, a surprise 
               visitor to the training table. All the players wearing 
               baseball caps, quickly doff them. Winters is angry.

                         around. Mix it up. Now!

               The players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up 
               and change tables. Darnell sits next to Joe.

               of the non-prescription drug cabinet. Joe pops a Nap and 
               looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE

               smashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with 
               the exertion. Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a 
               world-class player. She attacks with a vengeance, blasting 
               every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins 
               watch, amazed.

               We begin a SERIES OF CUTS detailing Camille's relentless 
               dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the 
               line, Joe barely getting it back to the net. Camille hitting 
               a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return. 
               Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends 
               it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving 
               again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille 
               puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost 
               knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence. 
               Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.

                         out.

               Camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike 
               least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither.

                         newspapers, football writers, and 
                         sports anchors. First we send them a 
                         packet on Joe and his achievements. 
                         Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff; 
                         commitment to academics, charity 
                         work, etc. Then we update it each 
                         week with a postcard. Heisman voters 
                         hate opening envelopes.

               Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this.

                         the top 20 last year, we only have 
                         one network T.V. game to give Joe 
                         national exposure. Although it's a 
                         good one; Michigan. But we'll also 
                         be taping all our other games and 
                         buying satellite time. That way we 
                         can produce our own highlight package 
                         and interview pieces and send them 
                         out to T.V. stations all over the 
                         country for their sportscasts.

</b>                         Any questions, Joe?

               If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. He tries not 
               to show it. After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign? 
               Still it's a megaton of pressure.

                         for the program. Publicizes the 
                         school, gives a boost to recruiting, 
                         and it's a great thing for you. Jumps 
                         up your draft position, the size of 
                         your first contract, everything. 
                         It's a hell of an opportunity.

                         the field, and we have no doubts 
                         about that, cause we know "Kane is 
                         Able."

               Nichols holds up a black CAMPAIGN BUTTON with the phrase 
               "Kane is Able" enblazoned on it in gold letters. This gets a 
               rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about

               Autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. She 
               becomes aware of someone approaching. She looks up to see 
               Darnell.

<b>                                     DARNELL
</b>                         Hey, Autumn.

<b>                                     AUTUMN
</b>                         Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here?

<b>                                     DARNELL
</b>                         My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya 
                         know, just to get me over a couple 
                         rough spots.
                              (showing her a paper)
                         I saw your name on this list. I 
                         figured if you couldn't keep my 
                         attention, nobody could.

<b>                                     AUTUMN
</b>                         I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already 
                         been assigned. You're gonna have to 
                         find somebody else. I'm tutoring 
                         Scott Sherman.

<b>                                     DARNELL
</b>                         Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters 
                         to switch us.

</b>                         Coach Winters wouldn't do that.

<b>                                     DARNELL
</b>                         Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect 
                         than Sherman.
                              (pointing across the 
                              way)
                         He's a lineman on the scout team.

               Autumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing. Sure enough, 
               SCOTT SHERMAN is hard at work with another Tutor. Autumn 
               can't believe it. She tries to compose herself.

               Darnell sits down across the table from her.

                         It sounds ridiculous.

                         I learn a new word out of the 
                         dictionary every day. Mendacious, 
                         pejorative, antithetical, 
                         commensurate...

                         Pretending to be smart is not the 
                         same as being educated. Or erudite. 
                         It's just a con. And it makes you 
                         sound stupid, no matter how big a 
                         prospect you are.

               Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His 
               customary bravado melts away.

<b>                                     DARNELL
</b>                         O.K... even more reason for you to 
                         be my tutor. You already taught me 
                         something.

               Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal. 
               She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having 
               trouble being angry about it.

                         play a game I don't know, but I ask 
                         you to try somethin' different and 
                         you hide behind your daddy.

               He holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her. She 
               burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her 
               to decline this challenge.

                         All right. But we go slow. No cowboy 
                         stuff.

               Joe smiles and kicks the starter. Camille climbs on and they 
               roar off.

               can tell she's enjoying it.

               Joe immediately accelerates, throwing Camille's head back. 
               Her SHRIEK is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed 
               away from camera.

               They approach a high-banked turn, beyond which appears to be 
               a long, sheer dropoff. Joe looks back at Camille, smiles 
               devilishly, not looking where he's going. Camille sees they're 
               heading straight for the edge.

               Too late. Joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of 
               the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, Camille 
               screaming.

               ear. Sure enough, there are SEVERAL DOGS BARKING in the 
               distance. Joe smiles at her. She looks away, still angry,

                         back. Don't know who my dad was.

               The chairs are arranged in several circles, ten players to a

</b>                         As the veteran players know, we have 
                         Pride Night every year before our 
                         opening game. It's a chance to get 
                         to know each other better, share 
                         some thoughts, and bring us closer 
                         together as a team. So to start off, 
                         I'd like each player to tell the 
                         others in his group what he likes 
                         best about football and then what 
                         he's most proud of off the field. 
                         I've asked some of the seniors to 
                         lead it off. Gentlemen.

               as Alvin charges into the hole, screaming at the top of his 
               lungs. The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away

               Joe hits the 4 count, and the ball is snapped. Bud Lite and 
               the Big Tackle fire out. Bud drives a forearm into the stomach 
               of the Black Tackle, doubling him over. The Black Tackle 
               comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping 
               his neck back.

               Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up. Bud 
               Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers 
               in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground. The 
               Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs. Bud 
               rolls him over.

               Joe spots his flanker back, MAURICE WARD, on a flag pattern. 
               Lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone. 
               Touchdown.

               The crowd goes wild, as Bud Lite pushes off the Black Tackle's 
               throat getting up from the pile. Joe pumps a fist in the 
               air, hugs Ward, as the team celebrates. MUSIC BEGINS.

               A reception of some sort for the players is in progress. 
               Darnell, looking a little lost, fills his cup from a punch 
               bowl. A FAT CAT ALUMNUS approaches him.

               As he walks by, he slips an ENVELOPE into Darnell's coat 
               pocket. Darnell opens it to find a 50 dollar bill. Surprised,

               Darnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where 
               Ray and Autumn are standing. A slow tune plays.

               Autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand.

               Ray reluctantly backs off. Darnell and Autumn start to dance. 
               Several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them

               Ray lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by

               she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped 
               around Joe, nuzzling him.

               Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed 
               to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and 
               wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get 
               it out.

               Near closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around

               She shakes her head and walks away. Darnell's grin fades. He

               The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's 
               strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a 
               BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately 
               the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter.

               Suddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is 
               Coach Winters.

               He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding 
               his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to 
               hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at 
               Bobby a beat, then.

               With that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain 
               silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash.

               Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs

               things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs 
               her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek. 
               Hits the floor.

               A very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks

               Bobby does. Instantly.

                         or it's football team. Clean out 
                         your locker.

               Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief. 
               There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally, 
               dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out.

               WHISTLE. Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward 
               the tracks as the train comes into view.

               Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, 
               starts to worry.

               Joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks 
               facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the 
               embankment toward him.

                         doing? No! No!

               As the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face 
               down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties. 
               Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the 
               train race over him. She falls to her knees screaming.

               Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground, 
               head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like 
               a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his 
               clothes flapping wildly.

               The train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe 
               lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes 
               himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races 
               toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade. 
               She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps 
               him over to the embankment.

               Joe's P.O.V. through HELMETCAM. He pushes the lunging safety 
               away, turns back just in time to be blasted by the OTHER

                         Kane brings 'em to the line of 
                         scrimmage.

               Joe fades to pass once again, lets the rush come, then flares 
               out a screen pass to Darnell. Darnell grabs it and takes 
               off, slipping tackles, cutting back, juking. Darnell finally 
               runs out of bounds at the twenty.

                         touted Freshman, the longest of the 
                         day for the Wolves. And this one is 
                         turning out to be everything we

</b>
               coming back to the huddle, pumped up. Joe kneels in the 
               center.

                         children to bed, and go looking for 
                         dinner.

               They clap hands, come to the line. Joe looks over the defense, 
               bends under center and barks signals, The ball is snapped. 
               Action goes to SLOW MOTION.

               Joe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass. The Michigan cornerback 
               comes on a blitz, locked on Joe. Joe starts to roll, but 
               knows the corner will catch him. On the run, he launches the 
               ball toward Darnell. Darnell opens his hands to receive it, 
               but at the last second, the Michigan SAFETY steps in front 
               and intercepts it.

                         And that should do it.

               Joe sinks to his knees in frustration. The blitzing cornerback 
               does a quick pit-pat on Joe's helmet. Winters looks like 
               he's been punched.

               As Michigan and Tim Waymen celebrate on the sideline, we go 
               to:

                         who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran 
                         for another. Joe Kane accounted for 
                         three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had 
                         that crucial interception in the 
                         waning moments. And that proved to 
                         be the difference.

               The door of the locker room opens, and a flood of reporters 
               enter. Joe hides back in the showers, leaning his forehead

               Darnell is jolted by this question. It's obvious that Autumn 
               has never told her dad about him.

               There's a slight tone of condescension in Mr. Haley's voice. 
               He realizes Darnell hasn't passed his entrance exam. This is 
               not lost on Darnell.

                         hadn't gotten my degree. I played 
                         ball once. Hurt my knee.

               Darnell embarrassed and humiliated, hears all this as he 
               walks away. Autumn wants to go explain, but can't in front 
               of her father.

               He tries to kiss her again, she pushes him away, starts for 
               the door. Angered, that steroid pump in his eyes, he grabs 
               her again, throws her violently on the bed. She screams.

               He gets on the bed, kneels above her. She starts to struggle. 
               He slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open. Freaked, 
               she begins to scream and kick. Enraged, Lattimer slaps her 
               around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her 
               some more, throws her to the floor. Picks her up again, when

               other players charge in and finally all four are able to

               up, a panting, sweating, shaking hulk.

               Not the 911 we saw earlier. Joe sits at a table in the back, 
               with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser. Both are

               Joe looks up to see one of the townies' girls, DEBBIE, giving

               Joe gets up to go. The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him 
               away. The guy charges Joe. The bar owner rushes to the phone 
               as a full scale brawl begins. Joe takes a blow, knocks the 
               boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the 
               floor. The boyfriend falls on one, opening a deep gash in

               Winters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the 
               odious nature of what he has to do.

                         punishment should fit the crime. 
                         Cheating's bad, but I don't think it

                         I think Bobby Collins made a big 
                         mistake, but he's already been 
                         suspended for several weeks. He's 
                         served his time. I think he deserves

                         As you know, I played football here.

                         dead tired. So I have some sympathy 
                         for this young man. But I never 
                         cheated, so the real question is his 
                         character. Since you know him better 
                         than anyone else in this room; and 
                         having talked to him and observed 
                         him over the last several weeks, do 
                         you feel he's learned his lesson? In 
                         other words, can you vouch for his 
                         character?

               Winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade.

               a titanic collision at the goal line. The back keeps driving, 
               twisting. Lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was 
               on steroids, is unable to. The back falls over the goal line. 
               Touchdown. IOWA 13 E.S.U. 10.

               As the Iowa players celebrate all around him, Lattimer sits 
               where he fell, a beaten and humiliated young man.

               Joe takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out. The ball

               The players, surprised at this turn of events, begin to file 
               off. Even the coaches are baffled. Winters walks over to

               Joe staggers the 20 yards, drops to do his pushups, can only

               They break and the E.S.U. offense comes to the line. Collins 
               calls signals. We go to SLOW MOTION as he fades to pass. 
               Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass. 
               Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard. Bobby flips the 
               ball over the charging defenders. Darnell catches it, gets a 
               good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is 
               out ahead blocking.

               There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into 
               the secondary. Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins 
               to look for the safeties. Ray, however, barely brushes the 
               linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. He lowers his 
               head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the 
               football. Fumble! There's a scramble. The Yellow Jackets 
               free safety comes up with it.

               The crowd and the E.S.U. bench, quickly deflated, sit back

                         will opt for the field goal. Around

               Darnell tackles Ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging, 
               trying to beat the shit out of each other. Finally, several

               Winters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of Orange 
               Juice and Gatorade. He swipes the cups off the table creating 
               a small flood on the floor. Then turns the table over. The 
               players are shocked. They've seldom seen him like this.

               Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells "Go!" 
               The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the 
               sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe:

               1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle.

               2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket, 
               scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard 
               line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt.

                         bring up fourth and goal. No doubt 
                         about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go

               Winters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field. Ray is 
               upset, angry. He swears to himself.

               The team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the 
               defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building.

               We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one 
               step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches 
               to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker 
               comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make 
               the block. He drops out of our picture.

               Darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The 
               linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle 
               on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder 
               to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray 
               reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, 
               knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out. 
               Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal 
               line. Touchdown, E.S.U.

               The stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer 
               about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to 
               talk to his defense.

               Darnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray, 
               grabs him by the helmet.

                         The Wolves have got to stop them on 
                         this play if they're gonna get the 
                         ball back. A first down here and 
                         it's all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of 
                         timeouts.

               The Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands 
               off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs 
               behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer. 
               Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers 
               his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a 
               fierce yell.

               Smash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision 
               lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, 
               vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the 
               tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face. 
               There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way.

               Lattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as 
               the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling 
               their arms, whipping up the crowd.

               Winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field. 
               He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes. Sees the steroids 
               there. He knows it's the only way the kid could have done 
               it. Decides not to bust him. Lattimer knows it. Winters gives 
               his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise.

<b>               ANGLE ON THE YELLOW JACKET PUNTER

               He catches the snap, boots the ball away.

               Darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline, 
               where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. Suddenly, he 
               reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where 
               a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there. 
               He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the 
               corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a 
               wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run 
               out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line.

               Joe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away 
               from the rush. Just as he's about to go out of bounds, he

               Joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as 
               the crowd's roar goes off the charts.

<b>                                     JOE
</b>                              (in huddle)
                         O.K., 24 inside slot, left blue 
                         lightning. Let's put the women and 
                         children to bed, and go lookin' for 
                         fuckin' dinner. On 2.

               He starts the wolf howl. The others join in, howling for all 
               they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors. They clap and break 
               the huddle.

               The crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the 
               Georgia Tech end zone. Joe looks up in the stands again at 
               the seat he left for his father. It's still empty.

<b>                                     JOE
</b>                         This one's for you, Dad.

               Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings "Bali Hi." We 
               go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped.

               The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing 
               everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks 
               up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player. 
               Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher 
               breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime 
               as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble 
               up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.

               Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern 
               and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one 
               tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back 
               for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between 
               defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen, 
               Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open 
               space that Darnell is heading for.

               The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. 
               Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close 
               on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. 
               Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes 
               between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, 
               landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls 
               over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This 
               time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.

<b>               ANGLE ON STANDS
</b>
               Pandemonium. The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes 
               crazy. Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost 
               wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing 
               none of them will hug him. Joe, Bud and the others mob 
               Darnell.

               Alvin listens to the celebration a few beats, then switches 
               off the radio, knowing this is an experience he'll never be 
               a part of again. We leave him staring off into an uncertain 
               future.

               The Chancellor and his guests are celebrating the victory, 
               congratulating each other. Conspicuous among them are the 
               Fat Cat Alumnus who gave Darnell the money, and the Chairman 
               of the Board of Regents.

               The Fat Cat Alumnus goes to a replica of the Building Fund 
               football field and starts advancing the ball.

               As Darnell comes off the field, Autumn runs out and hugs 
               him, leads him to her dad.

                         you.

               Darnell reaches into his helmet and takes out a sweat-stained 
               piece of paper.

                         Winters said you got an 87. He looked 
                         it up.

               walking toward the tunnel, acknowledging the plaudits of the 
               fans. He looks for Camille, doesn't see her. Coach Winters 
               comes up next to him.

               Winters gives him a quick, but firm hug.

               Joe manages a weary smile.

               coming down the tunnel, Bobby Collins next to him. Both stop 
               as Louanne walks toward them. Bobby smiles to himself in 
               anticipation of her fawning over him. She walks right by him 
               and up to Bud.

               Bud smiles. Bobby quickly looks around for someone else to 
               hit on, hails a cheerleader. Bud and Louanne walk off 
               together. Louanne stops when she sees her father, fearful of 
               his reaction.

</b>                         He's not a football player any more.

               Louanne waits, not sure whether her father's angry or not.

                         curfew.

                         down on the bench weeping tears of 
                         joy as E.S.U. goes back to a bowl 
                         for the first time in three years.

               These are not tears of joy, but a man/boy who knows he'll

               Camille's shocked that he might be drinking again. He pulls 
               a six pack of 7-Up out from behind his back. She laughs in 
               spite of herself. They settle again.
