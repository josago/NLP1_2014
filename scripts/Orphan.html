<b>          FADE IN:
</b><b>          CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S )
</b>          She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed,
          wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches
          her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder.

<b>          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over
          Caitti before you know it.
          Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL:

<b>          INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Harsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a.
          delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs-  
          across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist.
          A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP
          BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She
          tries to sit up.

<b>          KATE
</b>          Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't
          want to do this anymore.
          The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes
          Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table.

<b>          NURSE
</b>          Your baby is dead. There's nothing.
          else we can do.
          Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall.

<b>          KATE
</b>          No, this isn't what's supposed to
          happen. My baby's alive!

<b>          NURSE
</b>          We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're
          so sorry...

<b>          KATE
</b>          But it's still alive! It's moving!
          Feel it, you can feel it!
          Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse-
          pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped
          SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs,
          disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps.

<b>          RATE
</b>          No, stop! I want to be asleep!

          coming. You're.going to experience
          some pressure now... -
          Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen
          work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him..
          Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband,
          JOHN (late 30's). He smiles at her from behind -the camera.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          It's okay, honeys You're doing great!
          The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse.
          H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain
          again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the
          machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes.

<b>          KATE
</b>          This isn't happening. Wake up, wake
          up, wake up...
          Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide
          w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling
          bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric.
          W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING.

<b>          NURSE
</b>          Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a
          girl .
          The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams -

<b>          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          -- then snaps awake. She's been having a nightmare. John lies
          n ext to her in bed. Be stirs, but doesn't wake. Kate slips out
          of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom;

<b>          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Kate closes the door. We now see that she's not pregnant in
          reality, only in her nightmare. She slides to the cold floor in
          t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry...

<b>          INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          Water TRICKLES in a little Zen fountain. Kate sits across from
          -DR. -BROWNING, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's.

<b>          DR. BROWNING
</b>          A lot of women experience difficulties

          just four months ago. -
          (off Kate's look)
          Are you still sober?
          Kate hesitates. Dr. Browning gives her a penetrating look.

<b>          KATE
</b>          I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome
          the other day.

<b>          DR. BROWNING

<b>          KATE
</b>          No.

</b>          That's all that matters. Let's try to

          take it at your own pace.. Keep writing
          in your journal. You're doing fine.
          Rate smiles weakly. unconvinced.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM -.DAY
</b>
          Rate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window. She steps'
          back to admire her work, then sighs. Now what? Now that she s
          done, the house suddenly seems-quiet and lonely and too big.

          Kate sits in a rocking chair, gazing out a distinctive ARCHED

          After a short walk, Kate sits by a PEACEFUL BROOK lost in her
          thoughts. ,She pulls a JOURNAL filled. with handwritten entries
          from her coat pocket. After a beat,'she begins to write.

          Class has just let out, PARENTS arriving to pick up their KIDS.
          But the playground is MOSTLY SILENT -- these children an deaf,
          communicating to one another and their teachers by sign language.
          'Kate pulls up in a luxury minivan. Her five-year-old daughter MAX
          runs over togreet her. She's almost- ridiculously cute.
          (NOTE: Max doesn't speak. Her "dialogue" is SIGNED and
          SUBTITLED. She wears a REARING AID- to help her read lips. when
          people speak to her, they must face her and/or sign.)
          Kate kisses Max's'head and helps her into the van, buckling her
          car seat. Max shows her an art project she's bringing home.

<b>          KATE

          watches her for a long beat as if transfixed...
          In the backseat, Max-CLAPS her hands to get Kate's attention.
          Kate turns and sees Max pointing to the traffic light. IVs
          green. A car horn HONKS. Kate snaps -out of it and drives off.

</b>
          Kate sits at a baby grand piano,'trying to compose a piece of..
          music. She plays a few NOTES, frowns, tries again, takes a pencil
          and erases what she's written down.
          She pauses to look over-at a beautiful ORCHID in an ornate plants=
          by the window. For a moment, she just stares at it. Then:
          13 1 She's startled by something outside BOUNCING off the side
           of the house. She closes her eyes, frustrated. BANGI EANG1
           BANG! She tries to ignore it, but can't.

          Max is playing basketball in the driveway, but the ball's too big
          for her and the hoop's too.high. Every time she tries to shoot,
          the ball falls short and BANGS against the house.

<b>          MAX
</b>
<b>          SORRY.

</b>          -No, I'm sorry.. But just... take a
          break for a little while, okay?
          Max nods. Kate goes. back inside.
          A CAR pulls into the-drive.. It's John and eleven--year-old-DANIEL,
          Rate and John's other child. Daniel's blonde, brash, and-cocky,
          the all-American kid. He's wearing.a Little League uniform.
          Daniel runs toward Max. He steals her ball and dribbles-it around
          her in circles. -Max watches glumly. He offers her the ball, but
          when she reaches for it, he snatches it away and shoots a lay--up..-

          carrying a bouquet of FLOWERS. He hands Max the ball and lifts
          her up to the basket. Max happily puts the ball-through'the hoop.

          we still miss our baby. If this just

          The last picture is a FAMILY WITH A BABY ANGEL watching over them.

          John watches her, then reaches out, runs his fingers uup and down
          her back. Kate freezes. He can't see the-nervous look that
          crosses her face. He moves closer, pushes her hair aside, kissing

          from a big-window, shining on A LITTLE GIRL in a lacy white dress.
          Her. back is to us, so.we can't see her face, just curls of
          platinum blonde hair spilling to her shoulders. She sits at an
          easel, all alone, painting another extraordinary picture.
          John watches, curious. Suddenly; she senses his presence. She-
          stops humming, the paintbrush freezes mid-stroke. She turns.
          She looks about eight years old, with pale skin and-bright, doe-
          like eyes, her delicate features framed by Shirley Temple curls.
          It's the face- of a porcelain angel, a perfect little laving doll,
          friendly and inviting. She wears a thick black velvet ribbon
          around her neck and one around each wrist. Her'name is ESTHER.

          She smiles and demurely offers her hand, giggling as he takes it.
          She blushes, then turns back to her painting. It's a half-
          finished jungle scene with a SMILING LION crouched beneath a tree.

          As she speaks, Esther dabs her brush and paints little lion cubs
          curled up in front of their sleeping mother:

<b>          ESTHER
</b>          They were lost'in the jungle 'and they
          were so scared because they didn't'have
          a mother or father. But just when they
          thought they'd be alone forever, they
          found their mother sleeping under this
          tree. And they felt so safe that they
          fell asleep too. Now when-the mother
          lion wakes up, her dream will have come
          true. She has her family again.

</b>          We can't replace Yolanda any more than
          We can replace Jessie. But we can't
          help her anymore, either. Esther is
          alive and needs a family. Right now.

<b>          KATE

          Sister Abigail hands Rate and John a folder with a Polaroid of
          Esther stapled to it. Her- case file.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          19.
</b>
<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          For the most -part, she's an'ideal
          child. She's originally from Russia,
          but her English is flawless, Smart as
          a.tvhip and very mature Â°for her age. I
          don't think I've-ever had to tell her
          .anything-twice and I've never had to
          clean-up after her.. She's a bit of a-
          nQat-freak.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          I think we can handle that.

<b>          SISTER.ABIGAIL
</b>          She's also fiercely independent.,
          Whatever the other-children want to do,
          she wants to.dc the opposite.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          She told me they make fun of her.

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          I'm sure they do, but she doesn't make-
          things any easier on herself. She just
          doesn't seem interested in friends..
          She doesn't even play like a normal
          child. She just reads and paints.
          Most of the time she barely-speaks.

<b>            KATE  
</b>          Why do'you think that is?

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL .
</b>          Well, like most of the girls here,
          there's been no shortage of hardship in
          her life.- She's been orphaned twice--
          her birthmother died of AIDS, then the
          American family who adopted her was-
          killed in.a house fire. And I strongly
          suspect that she's been sexually abused
          as well.

<b>          KATE
</b>          By who?

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          I don't know. There's nothing in her
          -history, but that doesn't necessarily
          mean anything. Russian adoption -
          records. are notoriously unreliable.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          Then what are you basing this on?
          Sister Abigail hesitates. Deciding how much to say.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          20.
</b>
<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          I wish I knew. There's just something
          missing with her. A-spark you see in a
          child's eyes that isn't there. I've
          only seen that-before in cases where
          the child had been severely
          traumatized. It might also explain -
          some of her idiosyncratic behaviors.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          Like what?

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          She refuses to shower or change clothes
          with the other girls.' She won't even
          allow the housemother in-the bathroom
          with her. She.'.s also very concerned
          with her physical appearance for her
          age. She's like a teenager getting
          ready for a date every morning. She
          insists on wearing dresses-every day.
          The ribbons around her wrists and neck
          stay on day and night. . The only
          trouble we ever had with her was when
          we tried to take them off. She kicked
          two of Sister Francis' teeth-out.
          Kate and Tohn are taken. aback. Abigail sighs.

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          I'm sorry. I'm 'not trying to
          discourage you. If you're serious,
          I'll do everything I can to-expedite
          the process, given the circumstances.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          My one reservation is..this. When-an
          adoption fails, it's usually because
          the parents didn't know what to expect.
          -And'in this case, I can't' tell you what
          to expect because the plain fact of the-
          matter is that-I don't knaw.

<b>          INT: HOME FOR GIRLS - CHAPEL DAY

          she?

          probably the best chance she has at a.

          The front door opens and Max runs out to meet them. Daniel
          appears in the doorway-with DORIS COLEMAN (arid-60's), their

          It's Brenda. She pretends to not see Bather, just rides right by.

          climbs off the jungle gym and walks away. Esther watches 'her go..

          Esther doesn't move, but Max gladly takes her turn. After a beat,
          Esther follows Max up the stairs. Brenda stays behind, watching.
          Max goes down the spiraling slide, but Esther just stands at the
          top, looking down at Brenda.

          lands hard in the dirt and just lies there crying, clutching her
          arm and bleeding from a gash in her forehead.
          Brenda's scream draws alarmed looks. The Homeless Guy startles
          awake. one of the playground mothers comes running to help. But
          Max stands frozen, gaping at Esther in total shock. Esther stares

          She points the wrong way. Kate takes her hand and they quickly
          move through the crowd, looking for Max. John stands on a bench
          for a better vantage, Kate grabs passersby:

          Kate stops at a traffic light. Glances outside.

</b>          When you first asked about adopting
          Esther, I expressed some misgivings.
          But I wasn't completely straightforward
          with you. You see, I love children.
          I've worked with them my entire life.
          And the thing about love is that it
          sometimes clouds your judgement.

          something wrong with Esther from the
          moment I laid eyes on her.
          Kate sits up, concerned. John bristles.

<b>          - KATE

          abuse.

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          Yes, but there was something else. It
          was hard to say chat it was at first.

          to while she was with the Wallaces and
          asked if there'd been any serious
          accidents while she.Was there.. One
          incident was still fresh in everyone's
          minds. A boy in one of her classes was
          stabbed in the throat with a pair of
          'scissors. All the kids-who saw it
          happen said it was an accident, that he
          was running with the scissors and fell.
          But once again, Esther, was there.

          (off their-looks)
          Children like Esther, who've spent
          their entire lives-in institutions,
            have never had' a chance to 'form normal,
          lasting bonds.. The longterm effects
          of 'this- can be devastating.   In the
          very worst cases, children who fail to
          form early attachments are unable to
          learn the difference between'right and
          wrong. They can lie, cheat, steal ---
          .or worse -and and have no remorse
          whatsoever for their actions.' They
          view other human beings as objects,
          pawns for their amusement. And they
          can-be potentially very dangerous.
