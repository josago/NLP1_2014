</b>    The sun might be down, but the city is baking. Waves of
    heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates
    ACROSS the SCREEN.

</b>    The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen-
    ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He
    looks to the rear.
<b>                             FOUCHET
</b>               What's taking so long back there?

</b>
<b>    REAR
</b>    Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON,
    and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except
    for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform.
    His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be-
    along grin on his face.
<b>                             ANDY
</b>               How do I look? Like the real
               thing, yeah?
<b>                             FOUCHET
</b>               Step back and lemme get a good
               look at you.


<b>    CLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR
</b>    THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps
    further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the
    front.
<b>                             FOUCHET
</b>               Tell me again about your
               assignment, Andrew?
<b>                             ANDY
</b>               I'm the decoy.
<b>                             FOUCHET
</b>               Right you are.
    Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN.     BOOM!

     turns a corner.

</b>     He dials 911 on his cellular phone.     Fouchet sounds
     distressed.
<b>                            FOUCHET
</b>              Please help! I just saw a

</b>     Crowds moving up and down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people
     walking. Beautiful people watching. MUSIC BLENDS from
     nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to the
     hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with:

</b>              Report of an officer down. Be
              advised, all units. Corner of
              Lennox and Taylor.
     Slipping by the street cop: Intro MARCUS BURNETT and
     MIKE LOWREY. They shimmy through the hotel doors.

              private.

              The B.O. stands for baby oil.

</b>              Maybe you can come. Get off after
              you get off?
     All three of them laugh.
<b>                            DESK MANAGER
</b>              Well, now that you mention it.
              They were kinda cute. Suite 202.

<b>7    INT. COLONY HOTEL - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                       7
</b>     Lowrey and Burnett clip on their shields and unholster
     their guns. The posing is over. This is business.

<b>A8   INT. COLONY HOTEL - SUITE 202 - NIGHT                       A8
</b>     On the table are two briefcases. Each opened. One
     containing cocaine. The other, cash. A pistol next
     to each.

     REVEAL the dealers. Two young Dominicans seated across
     from the TV, getting high, drinking beer and laughing out
     loud at the Spanish language version of Time Traxx.
     Then --
     BANG! The door's kicked in and Lowrey's first through.
     Burnett on backup.
<b>                             LOWREY
</b>              Police!   On the floor!
     But the dealers split, rolling out of their chairs.   One
     goes left and the other, right.
<b>                                               CUT TO:

</b>     Lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor. A LATINA
     girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a
     hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered,
     Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw
     and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs
     him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:

<b>8    LIVING ROOM                                                  8
</b>     Burnett's in trouble. He's still got his gun in hand.
     But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs
     of a chair.
<b>                              BURNETT
</b>                Lowrey!
     Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep. The guy buckles.
     Burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window, just
     in time to see the angry Dominican heading straight for
     him.

<b>A9   EXT. COLONY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION                        A9
</b>     Burnett   and the other dealer come crashing out onto the
     balcony,   then over onto an awning, rolling off onto some
     occupied   cafe tables. Patrons scatter. Uniformed cops
     move in   to assist.

<b>9    LOWREY                                                       9

     the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his jacket.

                Nice backup.

</b>     As OPENING TITLES RUN and MUSIC POUNDS -- we FLY OVER the

     causeway bridge.

<b>12   EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - FOUCHET - NIGHT             12
</b>     As the helicopter passes over, he appears  from behind a
     large exhaust port. Casper, Ferguson, and   Noah behind
     him, all wearing high-tech miner's helmets  with built-in
     radio headsets, and an array of high-tech  tools.

</b>              It's time.
     The team crosses the roof to a huge air conditioning
     unit. They climb inside, carrying a six-foot-long metal
     case and what looks like a black scuba tank.

</b>     Though it's windy and cramped in here, at least it's
     cool. From a prone position, Fouchet puts on his night
     vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer. Quickly
     he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded
     onto the unit. TILT DOWN to see the various ducts.
     Endless. Bottomless. But clearly, Fouchet's a man who
     knows his way.

<b>14   INT. POLICE STATION - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT               14
</b>     Seemingly empty.   From squad rooms to locker rooms to

</b>     OFFICER BILL O'FEE, 50s, reads a magazine and drinks
     coffee. Video monitors in front of him show the
     different lockers inside the evidence room. We see one
     room with stacks upon stacks of heroin.

</b>     Kuni finds the conduit he's looking for, splices it,
     cuts into it with a Makita battery-powered circular saw,
     then attaches a handheld high-8 video machine and starts
     the video feed. The unit is strapped to the conduit.

     metal case inside the room.

<b>20   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - HEROIN LOCKER - NIGHT                    20
</b>     BANG! Another air conditioning vent grate crashes to
     the floor. Their headlights blazing, two men clamber
     into the cavernous room, Fouchet along with Casper. This
     is the special Drug Holding Room: The lock cuts like
     butter and the steel door is yanked open. One hundred
     million dollars in heroin. Each kilo brick is stamped
     with a distinctive octopus logo.

</b>     Where Ferguson is waiting with an air-powered tranquil-
     izer gun. He cuts loose a silent round that strikes
     O'Fee at the base of the neck. O'Fee stops. But before
     he can think to reach back at what hit him, his knees
     buckle and he drops to the linoleum. Out cold.

</b>     One by one he moves backwards through the various levels
     of locks, torching each to look as if they'd entered the
     evidence room from inside the PD station.
     Meanwhile --

</b>     Noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with
     large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it
     inside the air shaft.
     Ferguson attaches the black "scuba tank," labeled
     "NITROUS OXIDE," to a valve. This is connected to a
     metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the
     floor.

</b>     Fouchet and Casper moving the stacks of heroin, placing
     them in the air duct on the bobsled. Once they're done,
     we hear RADIO GARBLE, then the sled is cabled to the con-
     traption. A button is pushed -- and the sled is pulled
     at breakneck speed through the duct.

     an open-roofed van where the last of the gang, Eddie
     Dominguez, waits with the ENGINE RUNNING.

     CAMERA STALLS ON -- a perma-plaqued newspaper clipping
     with a photo depiction of Lowrey and Burnett in front of
     a giant pile of black heroin, thumbs up to the camera.
     The headline reads: MIAMI PD RECORDS RECORD HEROIN BUST.

     Where Lowrey wakes up in a king-sized bed. The pain on
     his face and empty, scattered bottles tell us he's
     nursing a world-class hangover. He sits up, carefully,
     holds his aching head. Hearing BREATHING, Lowrey lifts

     cabinet. Locating a new bottle of aspirin... he suddenly
     realizes that the SHOWER is RUNNING. Confused, he pulls
     open the shower curtain slightly. From the back, it's an

     old JILL, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the

     stepping his eight-year-old boy, QUINCY, who appears on
     roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and

               You know what I had to do? I
               drove your kids to school this
               morning. Your son forgot his
               homework. So I had to drive him
               all the way back in that junker of
               yours --
                      (as if looking at
                       Burnett for the
                       first time)
               What's that you're wearin'? Is
               that my new silk shirt? Is that
               my shirt?

               on me. But cool. I figure, what
               about it? If I'm gonna be Mike,
               might as well dress like Mike!
                      (singing)
               I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike.
               Swish.
      Lowrey's BEEPER SOUNDS.    He checks out the number.
<b>                              LOWREY

      Lowrey finds the nearest phone and dials.      Burnett is
      thinking Theresa?

               Yeah. Okay. What else? You want
               me do what?
      Lowrey glances over at Burnett who's clearly loving the
      fact that it's Lowrey's turn at errand boy. So Lowrey...

       gestures to the wall of feminine hygiene products.

      on the door.

</b>               Well, the anchor just moved.
      Both turn and look. And the chain is moving. At first,
      it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and
      the FRIDGE JOLTS! A deep, GUTTURAL NOISE sounds. From
      around the corner, a shadow grows large. Lowrey and
      Burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as
      a LION rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at
      the deck.
      The door swings open.
      Burnett pushes Lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.

</b>               No. It's not my place. My wife.
               She's a designer. She decorated
               the whole place at a discount just
               for Mike. And when she hears about
               how he's been taking care of --
                      (glares witheringly
                       at dogs)
               Off the couch!
      Lowrey chases the dogs into the bedroom. One of the dogs
      runs out with a Cole Hahn loafer in his mouth. They both
      follow him into the bedroom.

      The Woman strips off the overcoat -- under which she's
      breathtakingly naked, save for a garter belt and
      stockings. She drapes the coat over the nearest chair.

      Burnett is first to appear from the bedroom -- and his
      expression goes off the charts. Startled, the woman
      shrugs back into her coat.

      He sees two private    security cops named DE SOUZA and
      TOWNE. They split     and approach either side of the

      Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett
      respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out
      and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking
      Burnett's shoulders.

       even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear,
       he appears from the building, turns the corner out the
       door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off
       bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot.

      car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab
      and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of
      the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before.
      He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the
      dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and
      Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.

      gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets
      into gear. The WHEELS SPIN. The CAR LURCHES ahead.

      stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward and
      onto the pavement.

</b>      He rolls, makes it to one knee.   But his other leg
      gives way.


<b>      FOUCHET

      at Burnett, who's stuck in the middle of the boulevard,
      about to become instant roadkill.
      Then --

      Howard.
