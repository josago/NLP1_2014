               A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely 
               highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through 
               the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The 
               sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO 
               into the mist.

               She runs, and runs.

               She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway.

               Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a 
               tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.

               She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

<b>               INT. OFFICE OF "DEATHWATCH AUSTIN" - SUNRISE
</b>
               A clock on the wall: 6:11.

               Beneath the clock a simple banner reads "DeathWatch Austin."

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
</b>                         It's probably been about seven 
                         minutes...

               The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled 
               with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates.

               About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces.

               Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with 
               a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer 
               screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs 
               quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a 
               phone to one ear.

               The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12.

               CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE 
               (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at 
               nothing. She bites her lip.

<b>                                     COLLEGE GUY
</b>                         Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement. 
                         6:12. Roughly eight minutes.
                              (a beat as he records 
                              the time)
                         Number 36 this year for the Great 
                         State of Texas.

               They all exchange looks: they've lost. David stands.

</b>                         David, don't start throwing things.

               A PHONE RINGS. David controls himself.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         I'm going home. Let's do the press 
                         fax tomorrow.

               Another PHONE RINGS. Constance stands.

<b>                                     CONSTANCE
</b>                         Go. I'll do it.

               He nods to her, exits.

               She walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she 
               marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male.

               The wall clock reads 6:13.

<b>               EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE
</b>
               The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going 
               to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty 
               parking lot to Volvo station wagon.

               As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the 
               capitol building in the distance.

<b>               INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE
</b>
               David drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down.

<b>               EXT. INTERSECTION - SUNRISE
</b>
               David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop 
               inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance.

<b>               INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE
</b>
               He stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind 
               him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the 
               reflection of the rising sun.

<b>               BACK TO DAVID
</b>
               He stares, then:

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         Hey!

               The cop ignores him.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         Yo! Officer!

               The cop looks over; his face says he expects a confrontation. 
               David points to the seat belt buckle.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         Your seatbelt.

               The cop nods, weary, embarrassed. He reaches back for the 
               belt. David takes a sip and drives on.

               KRUGER (47) watches with a leg up on her messy desk, eating 
               low-fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric 
               massager. A name plate on her desk reads "Barbara D. Kruger, 
               Crime and Courts Editor." News magazine covers are on the 
               walls. Kruger is black, short, overweight, wears an old 
               jogging suit and new oversized athletic shoes. She has half-
               frame granny glasses on a cord around her neck.

                         of University of Texas colleague, 
                         Constance Harraway.

               Kruger reaches for a phone, hits four numbers, takes a chip.

               ZACK (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and 
               looking at a case file in his lap. He holds the cigarette 
               just outside the slightly open window. Zack has a bohemian 
               grunge thing going -- long hair, ultra-hip glasses. As Bitsey 
               drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel. 
               We hear strained patience in her voice.

               Zack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor,

               Three razor wire fences surround the prison. Guard towers 
               rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building 
               with a sign: "REPORT HERE."

               Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the

               Someone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny 
               Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty 
               yards away. He watches them neutrally.

               CAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a 
               series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building. 
               Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's) 
               stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim 
               skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside 
               him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back 
               against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white 
               guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the 
               building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger 
               (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the 
               chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.

               on the phone (DUKE GROVER). He waves them in and holds up a 
               wait-just-a-second finger.

                         You do that, Susan... Bye now.

               The office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet. 
               A portrait of GOVERNOR HARDIN (female, mid-50's) is on the 
               wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other. 
               At a desk sits a WOMAN WITH TEXAS HAIR (40's).

               Grover hangs up.

               Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the 
               Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows, 
               turns his collar up.

                         but then it's supposed to.

               The unit fence gate parts as they enter. The older gate guard 
               nods as they pass.

               They come to the door of the entrance area.

               The lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines. 
               To one side is a guard's counter and a walk through metal

               The door guard gets up from his small table and opens the 
               door for them.

</b>                         Here we are.

               The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel of 
               an empty school cafeteria. It is seamlessly intersected by 
               curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's booth 
               is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look 
               like they are in a sound booth.

               Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On the 
               visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each 
               section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center 
               is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots. 
               This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's).

               On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs 
               trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microphone 
               hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainless 
               steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.

               He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu and 
               David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet.

               Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvard 
               Yard.

               Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly. David stands 
               up politely in his cage -- he's too tall and has to hunch.

               Belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand.

                         And this is the man of the hour.

               They move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really 
               loudly) interrupts:

               guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture.

               to stuff them into his antique carpetbag.

               at the microphone. She understands, nods.

               Belyeu picks up his bag. He and Zack start the hike to the 
               door. Belyeu turns, walks backwards.

               They watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's looking 
               at the floor, caught in a thought.

               She does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile, 
               sincere, charming, vaguely devilish.

</b>                         Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met 
                         the summer after 4th grade, spent 
                         the day burning ants with his dad's 
                         magnifying glass. We called it playing 
                         'Execution.'

               David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the 
               air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse.

               Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen.

               Thirty animated students (circa 1992) are listening to David 
               lecture. He's younger (31), vibrant -- looks like a grad 
               student himself. On the white board behind him are phrases: 
               "Lucan," "objet petit a," "Fantasy Theory."

                         World peace?
                              (as no one responds)
                         Thought so.

                              loudly; others then 
                              boo them)

                         passions, and willing to sleep on

</b>                         Okay, good, you see Lucan's point. 
                         Fantasies must be unrealistic. The 
                         minute you get something, you don't, 
                         you can't, want it anymore. To exist, 
                         desire needs absent objects. So desire 
                         supports itself with crazy 
                         fantasies...

               The over-dressed Sexy Grad Student enters loudly from a side 
               door, out-of-breath and discombobulated. The crowd laughs at 
               the timing. David pauses.

               He animatedly gestures to the seats, waits a beat as she 
               moves towards them.

                         says the only time we're truly happy 
                         is when day-dreaming about future 
                         happiness.

               The Sexy Student sits, adjusts herself.

                         you wish for.'

               A guy behind the Sexy Student taps her on the shoulder, she 
               turns and he hands her letter from the registrar's office. 
               It's from a girl friend two rows back. The girlfriend mouths, 
               "It came today?"

</b>                         Not because you'll get it, but because 
                         you're doomed not to want it if you 
                         do. Think about it next time you're 
                         at a wedding.

               Laughter. The Sexy Student turns back around, throws the 
               letter in a book.

               Students pour out of the double doors leading from David's 
               class. The hall is crowded. Standing waiting for him against 
               the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes).

               She's looking at a document, holds a file.

               The students are leaving. David is quickly erasing the white-

               He turns, nods, takes his books and papers from the podium.

                         anything to pass.

               He looks at her a beat, starts to walk toward the door.

               The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian, 
               far better than what a university professor can afford.

               Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are 
               three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the

               Obsessively cool, full of designer furniture and rough

               lit -- a Damien Hirst piece sits in one corner. A few African

               A BABYSITTER sits on the couch reading a school textbook,

               Everyone has a t-shirt with a philosophic idea ("Yawnic,"

               empty, the flowers in disarray. "I'M TOO SEXY" PLAYS LOUDLY 
               in the background. Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from

               CAMERA TRACKS her THROUGH the living room, where a few people 
               now dance, and out onto the patio.

               A crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool. 
               They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one 
               with David, the other with Ross. The men are playing an Irish

                         to whom.

               Laughter. Two women holding each other boo. Ross drinks.

               David looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. He holds his

               The crowd has dispersed. A couple of small groups converse. 
               Someone is being thrown into the pool. TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS. 
               Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it.

               David is washing his face. As he dries, the TECHNO MUSIC 
               downstairs gets BRIEFLY LOUDER. He looks from beneath the 
               towel into the mirror. Berlin has entered the bathroom.

<b>                                     DAVID

               She locks the door, leans back against it. She's flushed.

               He folds the towel.

                         means.

               David lays the towel down, leans back against the sink --
               they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom.

               He makes an I'm-not-so-sure face. She moves playfully toward 
               him.

               She comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose 
               to his ear. He keeps his hands back on the sink counter.

               With her free hand she takes one of his, rubs it against her

                         body.

               She moves his hand down, brushing it against her breast and 
               to her groin. She brings her mouth toward her fingers -- 
               which are still against his lips.

               With her eyes open, she kisses the back of her own fingers, 
               runs her tongue between them, opens them to reach his mouth.

               A Hispanic woman (T-shirt: "DerriDa-Da") bee-bops to the

               About eight dancers dance to the TECHNO MUSIC -- its pace

               Berlin and David are against the sink, kissing in full 
               passion. The MUSIC from downstairs seems LOUDER. Her T shirt 
               is off. Panting, he turns her against the sink.

               Pulls her skirt up, reaches for her panties.

               Ross sits at the kitchen table, holding his throbbing head 
               against the POUNDING MUSIC. Greer sets a cup of coffee in 
               front of him, sits across. A long beat. They seem like parents

               Berlin is back against the sink, undoing David's fly as he 
               takes his T-shirt off. The MUSIC from downstairs seems even 
               LOUDER. His pants and underwear fall. He starts to penetrate 
               her.

               She turns, faces the mirror. He positions himself behind, 
               enters her.

               He looks at her in the mirror, then continues. She watches 
               him.

<b>               ON PATIO

               A guy sits alone at the far end of the pool on a lounger.

               David thrusts against Berlin, her thighs pound against the 
               edge of the sink. The MUSIC is as LOUD as it is downstairs.

</b>                         Yes.

               They continue in rhythm. She reaches back and pulls him into 
               her.

               Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax.

               The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC 
               STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from

               Two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles 
               on sound stage. The main monitor is playing the end of the

               A camera operator cues the host (50s, male, bow tie). The 
               host is flanked by David and Governor Hardin.

               The set has an upscale regional television look. The Governor 
               has the rare ability to look comfortable while David fidgets.

                         Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.' 
                         Tonight we continue our very special 
                         four-part series with the Governor 
                         Hardin. Arguing capital punishment 
                         with her is DeathWatch coordinator, 
                         Professor David Gale. Governor, you're 
                         up.

</b>                         Alan, let me say somethin' I always 
                         say.

               Constance stands behind the cameras. She motions to David -- 
               something about the papers in front of him.

<b>                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
</b>                         And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And 
                         that is I hate killin.' That's why 
                         my administration is willing to kill 
                         to stop it.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         So you don't subscribe to the idea 
                         that 'a good state is one that 
                         protects its most despised members'?

<b>                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
</b>                         It's a nice liberal idea, but like 
                         most nice liberal ideas, naive.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         It's a quote from you, Governor, 
                         from your first state attorney 
                         campaign.

               Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Governor 
               is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles with 
               her.

<b>                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
</b>                         You've got me, Professor. But let 
                         me, in my defense, give you a quote. 
                         Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a 
                         liberal at twenty, you've got no 
                         heart, if you're still a liberal at 
                         thirty, you've got no brain.'

               The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance 
               bites her lip.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         So, basically you feel, to choose 
                         another quote, 'society must be 
                         cleansed of elements which represent 
                         its own death.'

               The Governor makes an animated thinking face.

<b>                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
</b>                         Well, yes. I would have to agree.
                              (chuckles again)
                         Did I say that, too?

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         No, ma'am. That was Hitler.

               Constance makes a "Yes!" gesture with her hands. The Governor 
               is surprised into silence. The host laughs and, noting her 
               reaction, trails off. David becomes more confident, his tone 
               more sincere.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         Governor, can't we examine the 
                         possibility that capital punishment 
                         isn't working. That murderers aren't 
                         deterred by the law because they 
                         have about as much forethought as 
                         lemmings. That it's expensive, 
                         inequably administered, that...

               David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance.

</b>                         ...that we may even be killing 
                         innocents.

               Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this.

                         man Texas has put to death in my

               A beat. David doesn't respond.

                         you can't find a problem, there 
                         probably isn't one.

               Constance shakes her head in irritation.

               The show is over. David and the Governor are shaking hands. 
               Constance stands nearby.

               She moves toward her handlers.

</b>                         You folks keep up the good work. We 
                         need that opposition.

               Constance's and David's polite smiles follow her.

<b>               EXT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY

               Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the 
               parking lot.

</b>                         Your exact words were, 'Just tell me

                         you're so anxious to finger authority, 
                         to publicly prove that David Gale is 
                         so much fucking smarter than the

               They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are 
               standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s).

               The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine 
               it more closely.

                         crime?

               The officers exchange a look.

                         that there is no truth -- it's a

               They come to the stairs and start up.

               In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the 
               rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb 
               the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are in 
               their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feels 
               the music.

               The car moves through an older Austin suburb with wood framed 
               houses (circa 1950) in varying states of repair.

               It's an overcast day. Zack drives, slowly, searching.

               Bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined, lies with her 
               eyes closed.

               She looks up. Zack is pointing at house 3307, which needs 
               paint and a lawn mower. In front of the house is a homemade 
               sign which reads, "David Gale Death House and Museum" See 
               where it happened!" Beneath are the opening hours (12-8); 
               someone has marked them out and scribbled "ring bell."

               They share a look.

               Bitsey rings the bell. Zack stomps out a cigarette, points 
               out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his 
               eyebrows. As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is opened 
               by a GOTH GIRL, probably not quite eighteen.

               She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine Inch 
               Nails T-shirt. METAL MUSIC comes from within.

               The Goth Girl just looks at them. After an uncomfortable 
               silence, Bitsey extends her hand.

               They enter. The room is dark, messy, with an old couch and 
               TV/VCR. A kitchen is adjacent. The walls are full of Goth 
               bric-a-brac: London Batcave poster, one from Burton's 
               Frankenweenie, a couple of fan-zine pictures of Siouxsie and 
               the Banshees. In one corner is a very expensive STEREO, from 
               which THE CURE plays. In another, a dead plant. The Goth 
               Girl turns the MUSIC DOWN.

               A table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and 
               curling sheet of plastic. Small packets of snapshots sit on 
               the table along with a few hand-labelled videos and a book 
               of clippings. There's also a guest book.

                         I do prints kinda jerk my chain.

               Zack puts his back. Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Goth 
               Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic 
               wrap over her head. She's handcuffed and wearing a platinum 
               blonde wig. The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup.

               Zack looks at a video, hand-labelled: "Constance Harraway

                         over here.

               She takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a 
               dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler 
               (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has 
               been outlined on the table with white shoe polish.

                         was like constantly wasted. Drank 
                         Black Label religiously.

               Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into 
               the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various 
               areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- 
               the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the 
               patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty 
               pots with dead plants lying around.

               By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined 
               and indexed (#2).

                         show folks. They never found a camera, 
                         photos, or videos or anything. Gale 
                         must have buried them. These serial

               She moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of 
               Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are 
               a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing 
               tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on 
               the sink counter (#6).

                         here. The meter man saw her through 
                         the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped 
                         her mouth, then taped a bag over her 
                         head so she couldn't breathe. My 
                         boyfriend says that's probably when 
                         he fucked her. Your muscles tense up 
                         when you die -- the sex is better.

                         He used those housewife gloves so he 
                         wouldn't leave prints. They found 
                         sticky stuff from the tape on them.

                         left to suffocate. The Securitat did 
                         this to Romanians who wouldn't inform 
                         or confess. Sometimes the bag was 
                         ripped off at the last second, you 
                         got a second chance. If not, you die 
                         knowing the 'key' to your freedom

               David and Constance stand by the double doors. He's

               large parking lot.

               The lot is practically empty except for Sharon and Chase, 
               who stand near their Jeep. It's packed with various household 
               items, things not entrusted to movers.

               As he walks, David drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders 
               (like a fur). Chase squeals with pleasure.

               Chase bonks him on the nose. David sets Chase down when he 
               reaches his WIFE. He kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles 
               to move on to something else. A long beat as David and his

               side door, runs around the Jeep carrying Cloud Dog. He runs 
               to his dad, hugs him one last time.

               without comment. He then quickly runs back around the Jeep 
               and gets in.

</b>
               David is in the office of an overdressed YUPPIE BLACK MAN 
               (early 20s). David is doing his active listening thing.

                         Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me 
                         three personal qualities you have 
                         that would make you a successful

               David and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green.

                         For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll 
                         have to return.

               David chooses a club.

                         be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'.

               David walks to the ball.

</b>                         So my chances of getting partial

               David looks at him, then concentrates on the ball -- suddenly 
               it has meaning. He swings. The ball lands in a water trap.

               The living room is now Laura Ashley cozy. The sliding door 
               is open so the room's sunny, breezy. Constance leads David 
               in. She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so. Her

               David exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup-
               container, tries to sip one without spilling the others. 
               He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier.

               In the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his 
               Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front 
               of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the 
               passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back,

               David holds up the envelope for Constance to see, then

               David starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts 
               smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long 
               after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand 
               bleeds.

               Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward 
               her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks. 
               David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign, 
               holding Cloud Dog. He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio 
               Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand. He's sloppy

               David enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of 
               the couch, holding the sheep.

</b>                         Know why Saint Jude is the patron 
                         saint of lost causes? 'Cause his 
                         real name was Judas. There were two 
                         Judases, Judai, the saint guy and 
                         the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, 
                         and tried to kiss him. Medievalers 
                         wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear 
                         of getting bad Judas on the line by 
                         mistake. Ergo, they only gave him 
                         business when really desperate. That's 
                         why. Then they changed his name.

               David sleeps in a chair, on the floor beside him is a stack 
               of vending-machine coffee cups. A typical hospital INTERCOM 
               can be heard throughout the scene.

               A female DOCTOR (mid-30s) sits beside him, lightly shakes 
               his shoulder. He wakes, groggy.

               The guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down. 
               Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car.

               All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked 
               in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where 
               another Highway patrol car is stationed.

               The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only 
               vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people 
               in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive.

               An image flickers in. It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen 
               floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera.

               An opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the

               She appears dead.

</b>
               Hi-8 video: The woman does not move. The kitchen is cleaner 
               than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged.

               Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside 
               out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on 
               the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner 
               of the screen is part of what looks like a towel.

               The audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR 
               contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so 
               can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER.

               Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to 
               life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then 
               jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the 
               counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her 
               stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She 
               desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip 
               the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her 
               covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to 
               rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black.

               Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold

               At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator, 
               pushes the call button. As she waits, she looks out an

               something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella.

               As she turns the corner, she sees the older cowboy enter the

                         don't mean shit.' They fired him. 
                         Constance kept him in the

               They look at the college guy, who closely watches a computer 
               screen.

               In the center of the room, a middle-aged priest sits and 
               quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman, 
               she murmurs quiet affirmations.

               Finally, the college guy looks up at Dusty, nods. The room's 
               occupants all exchange glances.

               Dusty walks to the photo wall, marks a cross through the 
               photo of Jo Ann Johnson, then walks to the back office.

               she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been

               Constance and David are in bed making love. He's on top, one 
               hand supports her head, the other strokes her face.

               They tenderly kiss. He starts moving, gently.

               He kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm.

               Her moans take on a teary edge. Their voices, breathless 
               whispers, meld into one another.

               She's awake as David enters. He opens the curtains, sets a

               on top of the covers, spoons her, nuzzles the back of her

               Constance stands in a bathrobe beside her shower. Turns the

               She turns the water off.

                         focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed

               David sits in a swing set, rocks slowly. He's simply looking

               Constance is quickly sorting through a box of memorabilia, a

               Constance on vacation in a Caribbean resort. She sits alone 
               at a dinner table, looks to camera, seems surprised to be 
               photographed.

               David in the car in a mall parking lot, staring at nothing. 
               On the seat beside him is Cloud Dog and a half empty Black 
               Bush bottle.

               David's asleep, using Cloud Dog as a pillow. The bottle is 
               empty.

               A light flashes in on him, waking him. There's a KNOCK on 
               the window -- it's the police. He's blinded by the flashlight.

               Bitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protesters 
               flank the drive.

               She turns and walks toward the highway.

               The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers.

               The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists:

               They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint 
               signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder 
               doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large 
               black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey.

               The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty 
               activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs: 
               "Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's 
               Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours."

               At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign 
               leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain; 
               its letters run.

<b>               INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               The restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s) 
               eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, "It's Simple: 
               You Kill, You Get Killed."

               In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners 
               largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALISTS 
               at a table not far from theirs.

               Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own.

               He turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper over 
               her head, Zack slouches.

               Dark. Bitsey and Zack sit on either side of the room's table 
               looking out the window. Rain shadows run down their faces. 
               The room phone is on the table, as is Zack's watch: 10:17.

               The rain's lightened up. The motel's full. Lights are on in 
               ten of the motel rooms. The Kettle's lights go off, one after 
               another.

<b>               INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed. Bitsey, 
               lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her 
               perfectly arranged suitcase. She stops, thinks. She goes to 
               her purse and takes out the VHS cassette, a pen and a note 
               pad. Hesitating a beat, she puts the tape in the VCR. She 
               turns on the TV and waits for an image.

<b>               EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

               Rain. All the rooms except Bitsey's are dark. From within 
               comes a TV glow.

</b>
               has her shoes off, sits on the floor with her back against a 
               bed. She's still watching the tape, tired, exasperated.

               Finally, she turns the TV OFF, rubs her eyes. She stands, 
               looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand: 11:33.

<b>               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Bitsey brushes her teeth. Looks down and sees a towel on the 
               floor. Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack, 
               stops, looks at herself in the mirror. A beat. An idea hits 
               her, first as something odd, then as a freight train. She 
               spits, hurries into the bedroom.

</b>                         We're going over the crime scene.

               Bitsey checks the kitchen. The tripod's back. The other 
               exhibit pieces haven't changed.

               Bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse.

<b>               SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

               Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a 
               perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit 
               pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or-
               less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame, 
               she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.

</b>                         Move those index cards, too.

               She picks up the index cards.

               Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is 
               on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the 
               hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, 
               freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the 
               Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by-
               side.

               He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV 
               (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).

</b>                         I don't have one.

               Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter 
               as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over 
               them.

               He does so.

</b>                         Move the tape roll about a foot to 
                         the left. And get rid of the 
                         handcuffs.

               Zack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the 
               handcuffs.

                         the counter.

               Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits 
               on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt.

                         I'll position her.

               He goes to Nico, arranges her in the position of Constance 
               (which now bears no relation to the white outline on the 
               floor).

</b>                         That's fine. Just straighten her 
                         legs.

               Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at the 
               two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape, 
               however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower 
               right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.

               She plays the tape of Constance for eight seconds.

                         See?

               Bitsey touches the TV screen by one of Constance's feet.

               The foot moves ever so slightly. She hits pause.

               Nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen. Bitsey and 
               Zack stand by the sink. A white plastic bag is now on the 
               sink counter; beside it, the roll of duct tape.

               Nico hands Zack the key to the handcuffs. He tests them, 
               then lays them on the counter.

               Zack and Nico move behind the tripod. Bitsey puts the bag on 
               her head, rips off a long length of tape. She seals the bag 
               around her neck. She then handcuffs herself from behind,

               Bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something.

               She takes his arm, looks at him.

               Zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking.

               Nico sits on one of its armrests. Bitsey, full of adrenaline, 
               paces in front of them, thinking out loud.

                         Then she put them back on the dish

                         needed them. She knew she would

                         conviction, after a year or so. You

               The wall clock: 4:50. Dusty hears the PHONE RING over a 
               BARITONE'S ARIA. He turns the MUSIC DOWN, and picks up.

</b>                         Hello?

<b>               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
               The gas station is old, isolated on a country road.

               Closed, dark. By the road, a single light pole illuminates 
               the area -- its light catching the drizzle.

               Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey 
               waits by the rental car.

<b>               INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>
               Zack is on the phone with the booth door open. Bitsey stands 
               just outside.

<b>                                     ZACK
</b>                         Let's talk about your tape... No, 
                         meet me at the station down the hill, 
                         in fifteen minutes.

               Zack hangs up before Dusty can respond. He stops out of the 
               booth and gives Bitsey a tentative look.

<b>               INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Dusty hangs up, thinks.

<b>               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
               Bitsey sits in the car's driver seat. Zack stands by the 
               booth.

                         let it ring just once. Then get into 
                         the woods --

<b>               EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Bitsey is in the woods, watches Dusty pull away in the pickup. 
               She hurries to the front door, enters.

<b>               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching. She sees 11 
               videos on a bookshelf. Some are labeled, three aren't.

               She takes the cassettes to the TV/VCR. Puts one in (her hands 
               are wet). Nothing. She searches for the right AV channel.

<b>               INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>
               Zack anxiously waits. His eyes check the road.

<b>               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Bitsey has a picture, but the tape is an old TV western.

               She starts to fast forward, realizes she won't be able to do 
               so with each tape, hits eject. She checks the clock: 5:04. 
               She takes another unlabeled tape. It's a home video of a 
               city council meeting.

<b>                                     BITSEY

                         Shit!

               She grabs the next unlabeled tape.

<b>               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
               Zack paces in front of the booth, checks his watch.

<b>               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Bitsey has an old "I Love Lucy" episode. Ejects, looks at 
               the label: "Lucy." She grabs another, labeled "Unforgiven." 
               The credits from Unforgiven roll on screen.

<b>                                     BITSEY

<b>               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
               Zack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth, 
               drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch 
               the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong 
               to a car. He quickly hangs up.

<b>               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Bitsey is frantic. Another tape is an old Johnny Carson 
               interview with Pavarotti.

<b>                                     BITSEY
</b>                         Shit!

               She reaches for another.

<b>               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
               Zack hugs himself in the waning drizzle.

<b>               INT. WRIGHT CABIN
</b>
               Bitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She 
               goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up 
               on the screen. She hits eject.

               She gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the 
               bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, 
               indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly 
               rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something.

               She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it.

               After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer.

               It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to 
               "Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New 
               York 10036." A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it 
               open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label: 
               "Constance." The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at 
               the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring 
               again. A beat of absolute silence.

               Bitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands 
               shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in 
               her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing 
               the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water.

<b>               ON VIDEO
</b>
               Constance turns from the sink:

<b>                                     CONSTANCE (V.O.)
</b>                              (her voice weak)
                         Ready?

               The response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites 
               her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from 
               the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down 
               with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She 
               puts the glass in the sink.

               She takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks 
               one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another 
               small section, drops the roll on the floor.

               She tapes the small section over her mouth.

               She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it 
               a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes 
               watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts 
               the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air 
               out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other. 
               She seals the bag around her neck.

               She smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and 
               she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them 
               upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's 
               nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom 
               right hand corner of the screen.

               She feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them.

               She sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her 
               side, perfectly still, waiting.

</b>
               Engrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the 
               part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she 
               fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she 
               dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat.

               Dusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks 
               her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands.

               He picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. A beat. 
               We see only Constance's dead body -- then black.

               A hand grabs her shoulder. She screams and spins around.

               It's Zack, breathing hard.

               Bitsey hits the eject button.

<b>               EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Bitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods.

               The pickup is nowhere to be seen.

               As they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing 
               beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching.

<b>               EXT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE

               The car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle

               Bitsey drives. The overheat light is on. Zack has her purse

               The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate 
               shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He 
               runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist.

<b>               EXT. HUNTSVILLE TOWN SQUARE - SUNRISE

               The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring

               The rental car flies past a "Huntsville City Limit" sign and

               The overheat light is still on. Bitsey looks down, then turns

<b>               EXT. HIGHWAY JUNCTION - SUNRISE

               The highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork 
               reads: "TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles."

               Bitsey smells something.

<b>               EXT. HIGHWAY TO ELLIS UNIT - SUNRISE
</b>
               The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a 
               dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand.

               She doesn't close the door. Starts running.

               Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The 
               rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility 
               is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and 
               SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist.

               She runs, and runs.

               A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns, 
               starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves 
               around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on.

               She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past 
               a sleepy farmhouse.

               She runs, and runs.

               She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway.

               Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a 
               tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.

               She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

               Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights. 
               They rise on hill and then fall behind another.

               They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an 
               ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move 
               slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their 
               cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach. 
               The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas 
               Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION. 
               She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW 
               MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot 
               hear her. We HEAR NOTHING.
