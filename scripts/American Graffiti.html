               On a dark screen an immense amber light appears and an 
               electric humming begins. The eerie light glows brighter and 
               illuminates a single huge number--11. We hear static and a 
               large vertical band of red floats mysteriously across the 
               screen.

               Pulling back slowly, we watch the glowing band traverse back 
               and forth over the amber light and past more numbers appearing--
               70... 90... 110... 130. And we begin to hear voices--strange 
               songs, fading conversations and snatches of music drifting 
               with static.

               Pulling back further, we realize it is a car radio filling 
               the screen and radio stations we're hearing, until the 
               indicator stops. There's a pause...and suddenly we are hit 
               by a blasting-out-of-the-past, Rocking and Rolling, turn-up-
               the-volume, pounding Intro to a Vintage 1962 Golden Week-End 
               Radio Show--back when things were simpler and the music was 
               better.

               And now a wolf howl shatters through time as the legendary 
               Wolfman Jack hits the airwaves, his gravel voice shrieking 
               and growling while the music pumps and grinds...

<b>                                     WOLFMAN
</b>                         Awwrigght, baay-haay-baay! I got a

                         on de flowa--baay-haay-hee-baay!

               The Wolfman howls like a soulful banshee as "Rock Around the 
               Clock" blasts forth.

</b>
               A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot 
               as the sun drops behind a distant hill. A large neon sign 
               buzzes in the foreground... MEL'S DRIVE-IN, while in the 
               background, "Rock Around The Clock" blares from the radio of 
               a beautiful decked and channeled, white with red trim, tuck-
               and-rolled '58 Chevy Impala that glides into the drive-in. 
               Main titles appear over action. Steve Bolander stops the 
               elegant machine and gets out. He looks around, then walks to 
               the front of the car and leans against the flame-covered 
               hood. Steve is eighteen, good-looking in a conservative, 
               button-down, short-sleeved shirt. Most likely to succeed, 
               president of his graduating class. He looks around the empty 
               drive-in, then hears a funny little horn.

               A Vespa scooter bumps into the lot. A young kid waves at him--
               and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter nearly 
               topples. Terry Fields ("The Toad") maneuvers the scooter 
               next to Steve's Chevy but misjudges and ricochets off the 
               trash can before stopping. Terry grins sheepishly. He's 
               seventeen, short but plenty loud, both vocally and 
               sartorically in his pink and black shirt, levis, and white 
               bucks. He looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks he's 
               projecting an air of supercool.

               Steve watches Terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and primp 
               his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead. He 
               unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his pants to 
               look tough.

               Terry walks over and leans against the flamed car, imitating 
               Steve who pays him no mind. In the background, we hear the 
               Wolfman howling with the music. The record ends and a barrage 
               of humor begins from Wolfman Jack. The Wolfman is an unseen 
               companion to all the kids. Witty and knowledgeable about the 
               trivia that counts, he's their best friend, confidant, and 
               guardian angel.

               Now, a grey, insect-like Citroen deux-chevaux putters into 
               the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot. Steve 
               and Terry watch Curt Henderson get out.

               Curt stands by his little car. He's seventeen, a curly 
               bespectacled, scraggly kid with a summer-grown moustache and 
               a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts. Curt thinks of 
               himself as the town cynic. In reality, he's a hopeless 
               romantic. He starts over to his buddies.

</b>                         Hey, whadaya say? Curt? Last night 
                         in town, you guys gonna have a little 
                         bash before you leave?

                         all day, man.

               Steve reaches into his pocket and hands Curt an envelope 
               without saying anything. Curt opens it slowly and pulls out 
               a check.

<b>                                     CURT

                         thousand dollars. Two thousand doll--
<b>                         !!

               Steve looks at Curt suspiciously; Curt seems somehow guilty.

<b>                                     STEVE
</b>                         Mr. Jenning couldn't find you, so he 
                         gave it to me to give to you. He 
                         said he's sorry it's so late, but 
                         it's the first scholarship the Moose 
                         Lodge has given out. Oh yeah, he 
                         says they're all very proud of you.

               Curt hands the envelope back to Steve.

               Suddenly a horn honks and they all turn. Laurie Henderson 
               pulls into the drive-in and waves to them. She is driving 
               the family's '58 Edsel.

               Laurie honks the horn a couple of times. Steve ignores her. 
               There is a long moment and Curt looks uncomfortable.

                         finally getting out of this turkey 
                         town and now you want to crawl back 
                         into your cell--look, I gotta talk 
                         to Laurie.

                              back to Curt)
                         Now take it. We're leaving in the 
                         morning. Okay?

               Suddenly, there's an ear-splitting roar and they all turn as 
               a yellow '32 Ford deuce coupe--chopped, lowered and sporting 
               a Hemi-V8--bumps into the lot. The low slung classic rumbles 
               and parks at the rear of the drive in.

               Big John Milner, twenty-two, sits in his Ford, tough and 
               indifferent, puffing on a Camel. He wears a white T-shirt 
               and a butch haircut molded on the sides into a ducktail. A 
               cowboy in a deuce coupe--simple, sentimental and cocksure of 
               himself.

                         the rush? I'll go next year.

               Steve walks off toward Laurie's Edsel. Laurie gets out. She's 
               wearing a letterman's sweater with a large "Class of '62" 
               emblazoned on the shoulder. Steve goes to her and they hug.

               On the radio, the music ends, and the Wolfman's intro tune 
               comes on.

               As the radio blares "Sixteen Candles," we see that with the 
               darkness Burger City has come alive. A continual line of hot 
               rods pulls into the parking lot to check out the parked cars, 
               then returns to the maindrag. Carhops glide by on roller 
               skates. Curt and John are fooling around in front of the 
               deuce coupe. A horn honks and they turn as a '60 Ford with 
               three girls in it slows by them. A girl leans out the window 
               and smiles.

               The girls in the car all screech and giggle as they zoom 
               off.

                         Where is the dazzling beauty I've 
                         been searching for all my life?

               John watches the procession of gleaming cars traveling through 
               the hot night.

                         are really gettin' slim. The whole 
                         strip is shrinking. Ah, you know, I

                         full of gas just to make one circuit. 
                         It was really somethin.'

               Suddenly, in the distance, there's a blood-curdling scream 
               from an incredible high-performance engine. The entire drive-
               in stops and listens.

               Across the swarming parking lot, Steve sits in the front 
               seat of his chevy with Laurie. Budda Macrae, a car hop, leans 
               down to attach a tray to Steve's window, showing off her 
               tight blouse.

<b>                                     BUDDA
</b>                         A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate 
                         mountain. Anything else you want, 
                         Steve?
                              (Steve shakes his 
                              head.)
                         If there is you let me know now. 
                         Just honk and I'm yours.

               She tucks in her blouse a little tighter, gives him a hot 
               look and goes to get the other tray. Budda takes the other 
               tray around the car, almost shoves it in the window where 
               Laurie is sitting.

               She gives Laurie an antagonistic look and goes off. Steve 
               laughs. Laurie smiles. She's seventeen, very pretty, with 
               big doe-eyes, and a short bobbed hairdo. She pushes up the 
               sleeves on Steve's letterman sweater, which is sizes too 
               large for her. His class ring glints on a chain around her 
               neck. Laurie is sweet, the image of vulnerability, but with

</b>                         Um, how you thought high school 
                         romances were goofy and we started 
                         going together just because you 
                         thought I was kinda cute and funny, 
                         but then you suddenly realized you 
                         were in love with me, it was 
                         serious... and ah... oh, you were 
                         leadin' up to somethin' kinda big.

</b>                         You make it sound like I'm giving 
                         dictation. Well, seriously, what I 
                         meant was, that ah... since we do 
                         care for each other so much, and 
                         since we should really consider 
                         ourselves as adults. Now, I, ah... 
                         could I have a couple of those fries?

               Through the windshield of the Chevy, they see Terry run by 
               in front of them, chasing Budda Macrae who's outdistancing 
               him on her roller skates.

<b>                                     TERRY:

               Steve watches them go by, then looks back at Laurie.

</b>                         ..."consider ourselves adults"...

               Laurie pretends to be interested in her french fries, but is 
               obviously expecting something big.

<b>                                     STEVE
</b>                         Right... right... anyway, I thought 
                         maybe, before I leave, we could ah... 
                         agree that... that seeing other people 
                         while I'm away can't possibly hurt, 
                         you know?

               Laurie hasn't looked up but her mood has changed like a mask.

<b>                                     LAURIE

</b>                         I think it would strengthen our 
                         relationship. Then we'd know for 
                         sure that we're really in love. Not 
                         that there's any doubt.

               Steve smiles and then looks to her. He stops smiling. They 
               listen to the radio for an awkward moment. Laurie struggles 
               to hold back her tears. With obvious difficulty, she turns 
               to him and smiles. He's expected something different and 
               doesn't know what to do, so he smiles back.

</b>                         I think you're right. I mean, we're 
                         not kids anymore, and it's silly to 
                         think that when we're three thousand 
                         miles apart we shouldn't be able to 
                         see other people and go out.

               Laurie takes his ring on the chain from around her neck and 
               puts it in her purse.

<b>                                     STEVE
</b>                         Laurie, now, listen, I didn't ask 
                         for that back. I think that...

</b>                         I know. I just sort of think it's 
                         juvenile now. I'll keep it at home. 
                         It's less conspicuous there.

<b>                                     STEVE
</b>                         You don't want to wear it?

</b>                         I didn't say that. I understand and 
                         I'm not upset. I mean, I can't expect 
                         you to be a monk or something while 
                         you're away.

               Steve just looks at her and nods. The Wolfman howls an intro 
               to "Gee" by the Crows. Outside, skooting around the drive-in 
               after Budda, Terry is pleading with the sexy car hop as she 
               delivers a tray to a car.

                         collection. I even have "Pledging My 
                         Love" by Johnny Ace. Anyway, how can 
                         you love Nelson when he's going out 
                         with Marilyn Gator. Since he dumped

                         dip. Hi, Steve!

               Her tone changes immediately. Terry looks sour and turns 
               around to Steve who's getting out of the chevy. Budda leaves, 
               wiggling her butt for Steve.

               Steve notices Terry isn't with him any more and turns. Terry 
               is standing frozen to a spot.

</b>                         What's wrong?

               Terry tries to talk, much like a shell-shocked war veteran. 
               His mouth moves but only a gurgle comes out.

               Curt is standing by the Chevy, talking with his sister Laurie. 
               She's still upset by what Steve said to her.

</b>                         Nothing.

               Meanwhile, they watch Terry as Steve explains to him about 
               the car.

                         R. I've written the tire pressure 
                         and stuff on a pad in the glove 
                         compartment. Are you listening?

               The others are watching now as Terry shakes his head 
               mechanically.

<b>                                     CURT
</b>                         What's wrong, he's crying!

               There is indeed a tear rolling down Terry's cheek.

                              (He starts toward the 
                              car and gently 
                              caresses its paint.)
                         I don't know what to say. I'll... 
                         love and protect this car until death 
                         do us part.
                              (He circles the car.)
                         This is a superfine machine. This 
                         may even be better than Daryl 
                         Starbird's superfleck moonbird. It 
                         is better than Daryl Starbird's.

               Laurie watches Terry, realizing that like the car, she'll be 
               left behind as a fond memory. She turns and looks at Steve, 
               who's been watching her. There's a moment between them... 
               Budda comes by with an empty tray. Terry sees her and wipes 
               his eyes. He walks up to her, a strange look on his face.

                         the drive-in movies with me?

               The idea is so preposterous that even Budda is speechless. 
               She looks around at others.

<b>                                     BUDDA

</b>                         Would I kid you about a thing like 
                         that? I want you to know that

               John walks up quietly and casually pulls down hard on the 
               back pockets of Terry's low riding levis. There is general 
               hysteria as Terry quickly pulls up his pants.

                              with the others.)

               John looks at him suspiciously.

</b>                         Okay, wait a minute. Now, you're not

               John shakes his head. On the radio, Wolfman is taking a call 
               from a listener--

               John roars his engine and pulls the yellow deuce coupe into 
               a screeching take-off out of the drive-in. Terry and Curt 
               watch him go off.

<b>               MAIN STREET, MODESTO-NIGHT
</b>
               During the day, G street is a line of used car lots, small 
               shops, tacky department stores and greasy spoons. At night, 
               it is transformed into an endless parade of kids in flamed, 
               lowered and customed machines who rumble down the one way 
               street, through the seemingly adultless, heat-drugged little 
               town.

               Police cars glide ominously with the flow of traffic. In 
               parked cars, couples neck between flashing headlights. Guys 
               looking cool in a '56 Chevy sit in the slouched position of 
               the true Low Rider--and over it all the music and the Wolfman 
               can be heard. Just now, it's "Runaway" by Del Shannon.

               John travels with the flow of traffic, watching some dopey 
               guys shooting squirt guns from a moving car. John drives the 
               deuce coupe effortlessly. He looks over at a car pacing 
               alongside of his own.

               A sweaty looking guy turns and nods from the window.

               John nods and the two cars pull apart down the street.

<b>               TRAVELING G STREET-STEVE'S WHITE '58 CHEVY
</b>
               The Rock and Roll blares as Terry the Toad cruises along the 
               main drag, singing along with the music. Sitting low in his 
               seat, he looks around, his face aglow, experiencing a new 
               world from the inside of a really fine car. This is the 
               greatest thing that has happened to Terry in seventeen long 
               years of being a short loser.

               Terry turns a corner and another car pulls alongside. A guy 
               looks out the window.

<b>                                     GUY
</b>                         Hey, Toad.

               Terry looks over and smiles coolly, proud of his new wheels.

<b>                                     GUY
</b>                              (leaning out the window)
                         Is that you in that beautiful car?
                              (Terry nods modestly)
                         Geez, what a waste of machinery.

               Terry's smile changes to a scowl as the car pulls away from 
               him.. Terry accounts the slight to jealousy. Then he forgets 
               it and enjoys driving the beautiful Chevy again. Another car 
               pulls alongside of him as he cruises along slowly.

<b>                                     GIRL
</b>                         Hey, kid.

               Terry looks over at the car cruising next to him. In the 
               back seat, a guy has dropped his trousers and is pushing his 
               bare buttocks against the side window--a classic BA complete 
               with pressed ham. Terry looks away, wondering why this is 
               still happening to him, even in his new car.

<b>               TRAVELING G STREET-LAURIE'S '58 EDSEL
</b>
               Curt is in the back seat gazing out the window at the dark 
               main street of the small farm community. Steve and Laurie 
               are talking quietly in the front seat. Laurie is sitting 
               near the window and it sounds like Steve is convincing her 
               to move over. Laurie finally does. His arm goes around her 
               and her head rests on his shoulder.

               Curt is laughing as the Wolfman harasses someone on the radio. 
               The Wolfman is placing a call.

               Wolfman cuts into "Why Do Fools Fall in Love." Curt is 
               laughing in the back of the car, as he listens to the ever-
               present D.J.

               Steve slows the Edsel to a stop at the next light. Curt 
               glances over at a classic white '56 Thunderbird and sits up. 
               In the T-bird, a girl watches him. Blonde, beautiful, her 
               hair, backlit by a used car lot, seems to glow, making her 
               look almost ethereal. Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of 
               scaring her away. She smiles faintly---then says something, 
               so softly it's lost...

               Curt struggles to lower his window. She repeats it, but he 
               can't hear. The light changes. She smiles once more and is 
               gone.

               Curt looks at his sister and Steve in the front seat. They 
               are bored by his romantic visions.

               Laurie looks around at him and seems to pity his flights of

               lot of the Acme Fall-out Shelter Co., the prime spot in town 
               for girl watching. A guy in wrap-around dark glasses leans 
               by the car next to John. They watch a group of laughing girls

               John turns on his lights and swings the deuce coupe out into 
               the flow of traffic, after the Studebaker. John accelerates 
               and pulls alongside the Studebaker. The girl in the front

</b>                         You're just ridin' around with a 
                         bunch of girls. Hey, how about 
                         somebody else in there? Anybody else 
                         want to go for a ride?

               The girls chatter and giggle among themselves. One of the 
               girls dangles a bra out the back window, and they all break 
               into hysterical laughter. The girls try to accelerate ahead, 
               but John stays alongside their car.

                         It's dangerous to have that many 
                         people in a car. Cops see ya, you're 
                         had. You got nothing to fear, I'm as 
                         harmless as a baby kitten.

               A small voice rises above the chatter.

</b>                         Judy's sister wants to ride with 
                         you. Is that all right?

                         Yeah, sure, Judy--her sister--her 
                         mother--anybody. I'll take 'em all. 
                         Listen, we'll go up and stop at that 
                         light. It'll turn red by the time we 
                         get there. All right?

               The first girl grins and nods. John winks at her.

<b>                                     JOHN
</b>                         You ever get tired of going steady

                         up for grabs.

               The cars stop at the light. A girl rushes out from the Studey 
               and runs around the back of John's coupe. She opens the door 
               and climbs in fast as the light changes.

               The Studebaker pulls off fast. John pushes through the gears 
               and turns and smiles at his pick-up, as "That'll Be the Day" 
               plays on the Wolfman Jack Show.

               Carol Morrison shakes her head. She is thirteen years old, 
               very cute--wearing blue jeans, sneakers and a "Dewey Webber 
               Surf Board" T-shirt which hangs to her knees. John seems 
               slightly panicked.

                         go back and sit with your sister. 
                         Hey, ah... where are they, anyway? 
                         They comin' back or somethin'? This 
                         is a joke, right? This better be a 
                         joke, 'cause I'm not drivin' you

</b>                         But you asked me. What's the matter? 
                         Am I too ugly?
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         Judy doesn't want me with her and 
                         now you don't want me with you. Nobody 
                         wants me... even my mother and father 
                         hate me. Everybody hates me.

                         maybe they do. But I don't. It's 
                         just that you're a little young for 
                         me.

</b>                         I am not! If you throw me out I'll 
                         scream.

<b>                                     JOHN
</b>                         OK, OK, just stay cool. There's no 
                         need to scream. We'll think of 
                         something.
                              (He looks at her as 
                              she wipes her eyes.)
                         It shouldn't take too long to find 
                         your sister again.

               Suddenly, a car horn honks next to them. John looks over at 
               the car.

</b>                         Oh, shit! Hey, get down!

               John grabs Carol by the neck and pushes her head down onto 
               his lap so she can't be seen. John casually waves to the 
               friend in the car cruising alongside.

<b>                                     JOHN
</b>                         Hey, cool...

               Carol's head is being held down on his lap. She looks up at 
               him.

<b>                                     CAROL

                         a feel?

               John jumps, and immediately lets go of her as if burned.

               John is beginning to sweat now.

<b>               CRUISING G STREET-STEVE'S '58 CHEVY
</b>
               Terry continues to cruise the main drag, slouched low and 
               looking cool in his newly acquired machine. He adjusts his 
               waterfall curl as the Wolfman dedicates a list of songs. He 
               passes a group of guys bullshitting around the raised hood 
               of a souped-up parked car.

               Terry cruises alongside two girls in a Ford. He revs the 
               engine to get their attention and once he has it he motions 
               to roll down their window. They flip him the bird instead 
               and he lets them pass.

               Terry pulls up to a stop light. The car next to him is a '56 
               Ford--a good opponent and besides, the kid driving looks 
               younger than Terry.

<b>                                     TERRY
</b>                         What you got in there, kid?

<b>                                     KID
</b>                         More than you can handle.

               Terry revs his engine. So does the Ford. The tension mounts. 
               The green arrow for the left turn lane flashes on, the car 
               on Terry's other side moves off, and before he can control 
               his reflexes, Terry, too, has shot into the intersection 
               while the light remains red! Terry quickly shifts and returns 
               to the starting position. The other driver is grinning.

               Terry is flustered and embarrassed. Terry revs the Chevy a 
               couple more times, concentration intently this time on the 
               right light.

               Green!... The Ford bolts into the intersection. Terry likewise 
               floors the gas pedal and goes crashing backwards into a large 
               Buick. Terry is stunned for a moment, then realizes he forgot 
               to shift into first. He fumbles to get the car into first 
               gear.

               A distinguished looking man comes up to his window after 
               inspecting the damage. Terry tries to escape, but in his 
               panic the engine dies. He struggles to start it.

                         accident.

<b>                                     TERRY

                         this time, but next time just watch 
                         it, will ya?

               Terry roars off in a cloud of indignant smoke, leaving the 
               gentleman standing in the street looking dismayed. The cars 
               behind him begin to honk their horns and shout crudities.

<b>               USED CAR LOT
</b>
               Terry pulls up in front of a used car lot and jumps out to 
               inspect the damage to Steve's Chevy. He rubs a small scratch 
               on the back fender, but it won't disappear. As he spits on 
               it, a slick, baggy-suited car salesman ambles up.

                         practically new Corvette... and on 
                         top of this, I'm going to know 10% 
                         off the low price of this beautiful 
                         Vette. I'm talking about only $98 
                         down and $98 a month. Now, how am I 
                         able to make you this incredible 
                         offer? I'll tell you! I'm forced to 
                         move all the sporty cars off the lot 
                         as quickly as I can. Boss's orders. 
                         He doesn't want 'em. I think it's a 
                         mistake, but what can I do?

               Terry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle 
               his new Chevy. He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts 
               to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes. Finally Terry breaks 
               away and jumps back into his car and the salesman continues 
               to rave on as Terry drives away.

               the lights half-low, the noise high, and the waxed floor 
               being polished and pounded by stockinged feet as a seething 
               mob of adolescents join in that ancient rite--The Hop.

               A hundred of them are dancing and swaying while the band 
               gyrates on a raised platform. Kids on wooden bleachers watch 
               the whirling and spinning mass of ponytails and ducktails, 
               button-down shirts and mid calf skirts, cardigan sweaters 
               with little belts in the back.

               smoothed; glassy waterfalls being primped; the fronts of

               He stops slowly and looks at himself again in the mirror. He 
               finds something on his neck, looks around at Eddie.

                         Let me see some of that stuff.

               Eddie gives him the tube and Steve dabs it on his neck.

               Steve nods.

</b>                         No, but we got it worked out. We're 
                         still going together but we can date 
                         other people.

                         girls really give out.

               Suddenly a voice shouts "One-two--" they turn to see a guy 
               at every toilet hit the flusher on "Three," sending a torrent 
               of water down the pipes. Suddenly, there's a rumbling noise 
               as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor. Panic! 
               Everybody crashes for the doors, laughing and shoving each 
               other.

</b>
               The guys tumble out the lavatory door and abruptly cool it 
               as a dumb-looking paunchy teacher stops and looks them over, 
               rocking on his heels. They escape quietly. Steve and Eddie 
               meet Laurie coming out of the girls' lavatory with Peg. 
               They're watching the dancers as Hervie and his band moan 
               through a slow number--"She's So Fine."

               Eddie and Peg are listening and watching. Steve smiles at 
               them like everything's okay. He glares at Laurie.

</b>                              (under his breath)
                         Laurie, I thought since this was our 
                         last night together for 3 months, 
                         you might want to dance with me.

               He takes her arm, which she pulls away.

               Eddie and Peg are watching with great interest. Steve smiles 
               at them again. Then he leans down and whispers something to 
               Laurie.

                         the last guy left in this gym.

</b>                         I'll dance with you, Eddie. You don't 
                         mind, do you, Peggy?

               She takes Eddie by the hand and leaves Steve fuming with 
               Peg.

</b>                         Joe College strikes out.

               Steve gives her a snide look, then watches Laurie and Eddie 
               laughing, as they join in The Stroll. The whole gym is 
               Strolling in unison, like some strange musical military 
               formation.

<b>               HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY
</b>
               The Stroll music floats from the gym down the empty hall. 
               Curt walks along with his hands in his pockets. One last 
               trip down the grey, locker-lined corridor. He slows and stops 
               by locker 2127. He smiles a little, then flips the dial of 
               the lock. Once to the right--back to the left--then to the 
               right again. Curt hits the handle. It doesn't open. Changed 
               already. He shrugs and goes off down the hallway.

<b>               HIGH SCHOOL GYM
</b>
               Curt walks in the background, behind the line of kids clapping 
               as one couple Strolls down between them. Then Curt hears 
               somebody call him.

<b>                                     MR. WOLFE (O.S.)
</b>                         Hey--Curtis!

               Curt wanders over toward a young teacher, Mr. Wolfe, who is 
               surrounded by a group of admiring (and grade-seeking) girls. 
               Mr. Wolfe wears ivy league clothes and is about twenty-five, 
               not much older than his students.

</b>                         No, really, I'd like to, but I can't. 
                         I mean, if old Mr. Simpson came in 
                         here and saw me dancing with one of 
                         you sexy little--excuse me... one of 
                         you young ladies, he'd have my rear

</b>                         Aahhh.

               The all giggle. Mr. Wolfe shrugs at Curt and heads for a 
               door. Curt follows him and they escape from the girls into 
               the night.

<b>               OUTSIDE THE GYM
</b>
               Curt and Mr. Wolfe come out of the gym. Mr. Wolfe sees a 
               couple of guys skulking around in the shadows smoking 
               cigarettes and laughing. The music has changed to "See You 
               in September."

                         I have no matches.

               Mr. Wolfe takes out a pack of matches and lights both their 
               cigarettes. They walk down a chain-link fence, past dark, 
               venetian-blinded classrooms.

               Then a voice calls from the shadows.

               They turn and see a girl coming out of a doorway. Mr. Wolfe 
               looks at Jane, one of his students, but doesn't say anything.

               He looks at Mr. Wolfe, who seems a little embarrassed. Then, 
               Mr. Wolfe sticks out his hand.

               Curt shakes his hand.

</b>                         Yeah... I'll see you. Thanks a lot.

               Curt walks back toward the gym. Looking around, he sees Mr. 
               Wolfe standing in the shadows with the girl, talking 
               intimately. Curt turns away and goes off. Before going back 
               into the gym, Curt stops. He sees a white T-bird parked among 
               a row of cars in the parking lot. He walks--then starts 
               running toward the car. There's a blonde sitting in the front 
               seat making out with some guy.

               Curt leans down to the window and is about to say something 
               to his dream girl. But she turns and he sees it's not her. 
               Her boyfriend glares at him like he's some kind of peeping 
               Tom. Curt backs away awkwardly, trying to smile. He leaves.

               nose. He swipes the shaving cream on his nose--swerving--A 
               car honks.

               Carol sinks into her corner of the car. She sticks her tongue 
               out for a quick moment.

               He stares at her and she shuts up. "Surfin' Safari" is blaring 
               on the radio and she starts twisting with the music. John 
               turns the radio off.

               The cop is tapping at John's window. John wipes his face.

               Holstein looks at him, then steps back, looks at the car. 
               Holstein's only a couple years older than John, but the 
               uniform separates them by light years.

               Holstein drops the ticket through the window onto John's 
               lap. He starts back to his patrol car. When he's out of 
               earshot John answers.

               She looks amazed as she adds the new ticket to a mess of 
               similar tickets crammed in the glove compartment. The police 
               car pulls by them. John scowls, then roars his engine and 
               pulls back into the stream of traffic.

<b>               CRUISING MAIN STREET--STEVE'S '58 CHEVY
</b>
               Terry is looking and feeling like he's got it made. He 
               downshifts and slows for a red light. A very mean-looking 
               black '55 Chevy--blown, scooped and slicked--pulls up next 
               to him. The driver, Bob Falfa, has a gum-chewing girlfriend 
               sitting almost on top of him. Terry challenges the '55 Chevy 
               by revving his engine.

               Bob Falfa doesn't even look over. He revs his engine--which 
               sounds like a cross between a Boeing 707 and a SuperChief. 
               Terry can't believe it. He quits revving his engine--feeling 
               deflated.

               Terry looks over at the snotty grin on Falfa's girlfriends' 
               face.

                              smile)
                         Ain't he neat?

               Terry doesn't say anything. There's another incredible scream 
               as Falfa roars off, leaving Terry to stare through his smoke. 
               Terry accelerates the '58 Chevy--at a prudent speed.

               As the radio blares "Almost Grown," Terry glides past the 
               lighted stores slowly, taking in everything with wide eyes 
               from his beautiful new car.

               Terry passes a steaming rear-end collision at an intersection 
               where two guys and two girls are all yelling.

               Then, suddenly, he spots a girl--walking--alone. His mouth 
               drops open in amazement as he slows to a crawl. Debbie, 
               nineteen, with blonde hair, wearing a blue and white spaghetti-
               strap dress, strolls along the sidewalk.

               Terry rolls the powerful engine, but she ignores him. As he 
               passes her, he speeds up.

<b>                                     TERRY

                         And Wolfman Baby, she's all mine.

               Terry tears around the corner and starts his approach once 
               more. He quickly whips out his comb, touches up his hair and 
               settles down into a comfortable slouch.

                         lives!

               He hits the clutch, roars the engine a couple more times and 
               then--disaster. Debbie passes behind some rough looking dudes 
               on motorcycles, parked along the curb. One especially vicious 
               biker turns and looks at Terry as he passes.

               Terry roars off around the block.

<b>                                     TERRY
</b>                         Stay cool, honey--don't let those 
                         creeps bug you. Wolfman, please don't 
                         let those creeps bug her... please.

               As Debbie passes the bikers, they hoot, holler, and make 
               barnyard noises. From the cat calls, and Debbie's manner it 
               seems obvious that Debbie is a girl a lot of boys have 
               "known."

               She has walked clear of the bikers as Terry screeches around 
               the corner again. He pulls up alongside her and again slows 
               to a crawl. The pass each other for awhile, but she doesn't 
               look over.

               This stops her and she turns--Terry hits the brakes and the 
               car bounces.

               Terry is elated. He climbs out of the car and she slides in 
               the driver's side. Terry climbs back in next to her and slams 
               the door. She's sitting right next to him--like a real date 
               should. Terry gets a little nervous.

                         out.

               Terry nods, checks his clutch, revs the engine to a high-
               pitched whine and they're off--

               The tires smoke, scream, the car shots off, fish-tailing, 
               nearly hitting a parked car, straightening out... and 
               disappears down Main Street.

<b>               HIGH SCHOOL GYM--THE HOP
</b>
               On stage, the band is "taking five." They're looking tough 
               for the girls while the Student Body Secretary is making 
               announcements at the mike.

                         way from Stockton. Let's hear it.

               There's applause as the girl continues.

                         who did all these neat decorations.

               There's more applause. Standing among the crowd, Steve and 
               Laurie both look angry.

                         and this year's head cheerleader, 
                         Laurie Henderson.

               There's applause, whistles and cheers from the crowd. A blue 
               spotlight floats over the dance floor and then lands on Steve 
               and Laurie, who are in the midst of their argument.

               Laurie squints into the spotlight and realizes everybody's 
               watching them.

                         watching. Smile or something.

               Steve gives a sick smile as she drags him out onto the floor. 
               A record needle scratches and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" blares 
               out as Steve and Laurie dance alone in the middle of the 
               floor. The crowd quiets, getting a little misty about this 
               soon-to-be separated teenage couple. For their part, Steve 
               and Laurie are arguing, whispering in each other's ears.

                         the first place.

               He takes her hand from the tucked-under-the-chin position 
               and puts it around him, in a bear-hug.

               They continue to dance slowly. Laurie starts to cry, hating 
               herself for it. Steve loosens a minute and looks at her.

               He holds her tighter and they circle the floor, all alone, 
               the crowd watching quietly, the gym echoing with "Smoke Gets 
               in Your Eyes."

<b>               THE GYM PARKING LOT

               Curt is leaning against a car in the parking lot. He's looking 
               up at the stars and listening to the music floating out from 
               the gym.

                         caps?

               A pretty, dark-haired girl, Wendy, slides up next to him and 
               leans against the car. There's an awkward pause like that 
               which happens often when two people who used to be close 
               meet after things have changed.

               A horn honks and Wendy turns to a VW that's idling nearby.

               They go off toward the VW and climb in.

               The hop is almost over and the lights have been lowered, 
               conservatively. Steve and Laurie hold each other, hardly 
               moving and he kisses her. Still kissing, they continue to 
               circle slowly--until a short, totally bald teacher comes and 
               pokes Steve in the side.

               He gives them a disgusted look and starts off.

               She gets in and the car goes off.

               In the back seat, Curt and Wendy are talking softly. He puts 
               his arm around her and she makes a face, but doesn't remove 
               it. Bobbie watches in the rear-view mirror, Curt sees her.

               Curt looks at her and turns her head. He kisses her and puts 
               his arm around her. They neck. The radio plays "Barbara Ann."

               The little VW flashes by in the stream of traffic. Bobbie 
               drives, glancing in here rear-view mirror occasionally and 
               also watching the station wagon ahead, in which two pairs of 
               feet are dancing against the back window.

               Wendy pulls away from Curt's lips and looks out the window.

                         neat.

               Wendy turns and leans forward, laughing. Curt watches her

               yells out Bobbie's window.

               Wendy is laughing and Curt climbs over her out of the small 
               car. He gets out and closes the door. Wendy changes seats 
               and looks at him seriously.

               The VW's gone and Curt starts after the T-bird on foot. He 
               runs down the middle of the street, oblivious to the horns 
               honking and the cars swerving to miss him.

               We move with Curt as he moves like a broken field runner 
               through the traffic only to finally lose the girl and the 
               Thunderbird and to slow and finally stop, standing on the 
               white line. Cars slow down and kids rubberneck as they go by

               She slugs John on the arm. John grabs her arm as she starts 
               to swing again.

                         Been hittin' me all night. Kids will 
                         be kids, you know.

               She struggles to hit him and spills her coke all over the 
               car. He pushes her rather roughly against the door.

                              (looking at Al again)
                         We don't get along too well. It's 
                         been like this--

</b>                         You spastic creep!

               She is about to really cry this time. She jumps out of the 
               car and runs off down the street. John wipes his car out as 
               Al and Linda watch in amazement.

                         before noon.

               John mutters profanities to himself, but his anger subsides 
               after a few moments. He looks back in the direction Carol 
               went. All he can see are two Hell's Angels on choppers rolling 
               in the same direction. He looks a little concerned and starts 
               the coupe.

               John roars along looking for her until he sees her walking 
               angrily along the sidewalk--being followed by a Ford full of 
               guys.

               John passes Carol and the Ford and pulls over and stops just 
               ahead of them. Carol stops when she sees John. The Ford also 
               stops and the guys call out to her. She considers the 
               situation a moment, then runs and gets in with John. He pulls 
               off and she grins at him happily.

               Terry pulls into the parking lot and stops. He looks up at 
               the flashing liquor store sign and considers his battle plan. 
               "Maybe Baby" by Buddy Holly is playing on the radio.

                         over to the store. He starts to enter, 
                         then stops and thinks. He sees a man 
                         in a business suit approaching, and 
                         smiles.

               The man regards him, Terry pretends to start off until the 
               man goes in. Terry pulls himself together as another man 
               approaches, or rather stumbles up, being older, scruffy and, 
               essentially, a bum.

                         some Old Harper, hard stuff. Would 
                         you mind buying a bottle for me?

               The bum is still trying to focus on Terry and smiles.

                         her name wasn't Idy, though, and it 
                         wasn't in a flood--but I know what

               The old man takes the money and falls into the store. Terry 
               watches and then waves to Debbie in the car that everything 
               is cool.

               As he waits for the bum to come back out, the first man in 
               the suit exits. Terry smiles at him again.

               The man gets into the car and backs out. Terry goes over to 
               the window of the liquor store and looks to see how the wino's 
               doing with his booze. Terry sees the liquor store owner 
               setting four bottles of cheap wine on the counter.

                         Hey, no. Not wine. Ssss--hey!

               The owner turns and sees Terry waving. Terry ducks out of 
               sight. When he looks back again, Terry sees the old bum is 
               gone! Terry can't believe it. He finally enters the store.

<b>               INSIDE THE LIQUOR STORE

               Terry tries to look very casual as he sidles up to the 
               counter. Country-Western music hums over the liquor in hi-
               fi.

               Terry looks at the man and the endless rows of liquor behind 
               him.

                         couple of flashlight batteries and 
                         some of this beef jerky.

               The owner puts everything into a bag and starts to ring it 
               up.

               The owner takes the liquor out of the bag and puts it back 
               on the shelf. Terry stands there. The owner takes the money 
               from him and gives him his change.

               She takes the money from a squeeze-open plastic change purse 
               and hands it to him. Terry smiles weakly and goes back to 
               try his luck again at the liquor store.

               He stops in front of the door as a young guy with numerous 
               tattoos on his bulging arms approaches the liquor store.

               He takes Terry's money and enters the store. The clerk hands 
               the man a bottle of Old Harper. Terry waves excitedly to 
               Debbie, lowering his pants a bit. Suddenly, there's a gunshot! 
               Terry whirls to see the young man stuffing cash from the 
               register into his pockets, backing away with a smoking gun. 
               He rushes out of the store, tossing the bottle to Terry and 
               running off into the night. Suddenly, the owner emerges from 
               behind the counter, shooting wildly. Terry ducks and heads 
               for the car with his pint of Old Harper.

               John's '32 deuce coupe crunches to a gravelly stop in front

               climb over the fence. They walk through a valley of twisted,

               John sticks his hand into his pockets moodily and stops and

                         Almost rolled once. So far I've been 
                         quick enough to stay out of here. 
                         The quick and the dead.

</b>                         I've never been beaten--lot of punks 
                         have tried. See that '41 Ford there? 
                         Used to be the fastest wheels in the 
                         valley. I never got a chance to race 
                         old Earl. He got his in '55 in the 
                         hairiest crash ever happened around 
                         here. He was racing a '54 Chevy, 
                         bored and loaded, out on the old 
                         Oakdale Highway and every damn kid 
                         in town was out there. The Chevy 
                         lost its front wheel doing about 85. 
                         The idiot had torched the spindles 
                         to lower the front end and it snapped 
                         right off. He slammed bam into the 
                         Ford and then they both of them 
                         crashed into a row of cars and all 
                         those kids watchin! Jesus, eight 
                         kids killed including both drivers, 
                         looked like a battlefield. Board of 
                         Education was so impressed they filmed 
                         it. Show it now in Drivers Education, 
                         maybe you'll see it. Anyway, since 
                         then street racing's gone underground. 
                         No spectators, I mean. Too bad.

               Carol takes his hand and they walk a bit, until John realizes 
               what he's doing, and drops her hand and pulls away.

                         such a drip.

               She stomps off and gets back into the coupe, quickly rolling 
               up all the windows. John saunters up and finds the door 
               locked.

                         she's a foxy little tail."

               John grins and starts to pull his keys out of his pocket. He 
               stops grinning: Carol grins and dangles his keys inside the 
               car. John leans against the window, closes his eyes, a 
               defeated man.

                         little tail.

               He hears the button click up and slowly opens the door.

                         Baby.

               The Wolfman's gravelly voice whispers over the airwaves as 
               John and Carol drive out of the shadowy car grave-yard.

<b>               WILSON'S APPLIANCE STORE
</b>
               Curt is sitting on the hood of a parked De Soto watching a 
               row of televisions in the window of an appliance store. Twelve 
               silent images of Ricky Nelson on "Ozzie and Harriet" glow in 
               the dark showroom. Music from passing cars rises and fades 
               as they cruise behind Curt. The Wolfman can be heard.

<b>                                     WOLFMAN (V.O.)
</b>                         Oh, this is gonna strike a raw nerve, 
                         mama. Here's the Platters.

               The Wolfman howls and the Platters wail into the "Great 
               Pretender." Curt sings along, mouthing the words. Then 
               somebody walks in front of Curt.

               Curt pays no attention, then sense the presence of another 
               guy. Soon he realizes that he is being surrounded by a group 
               of three hoods. They slink up from all sides wearing car 
               coats with the name "PHAROAHS" embroidered across the back.

               Curt looks them over--they all watch the silent tv's. One of 
               them, without turning, talks to Curt.

</b>                         Don't know Gil... you oughta. You

                         and that's his car you're sitting 
                         on.

               There's silence. Curt looks uneasy and slides quietly off 
               the De Soto. Curt sticks his hands in his pockets and starts 
               slowly down the sidewalk.

<b>                                     JOE

                         No place. Not going any place.

                         Ants, I want to show him something.

               Ants (a tall, ghoulish-looking kid who probably got his name 
               from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched 
               to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek) brings 
               Curt back gently.

               Joe is bent over looking across the hood of the De Soto.

<b>                                     JOE

</b>                         I guess so--yeah.

               Joe unbends and lightly punches Curt on the shoulder.

<b>                                     JOE

                         man?

               Joe gives him another charming punch on the shoulder. The 
               others have left the tv's and are watching Curt now, looking 
               puzzled and pained at the scratch on the car.

</b>                         I'm sorry. It's not much of a scratch.

                         here. It's the principle. Jeez, this

</b>                         Tie him to the car and drag him.

               Curt turns and laughs at Ants' suggestion. He laughs and 
               laughs until he realizes nobody else is; they are pondering 
               the suggestion.

               They all grin and laugh with Curt who feels better.

<b>                                     JOE
</b>                         Sure, good old Toby. He's a friend

                         his guts.

               Curt stops smiling again.

</b>                         Oh--well, I don't know him that much 
                         anyway.

               Curt looks at them both, praying they're kidding. Joe looks 
               at him, shaking his head.

                              (putting his arm around 
                              Curt)
                         Go riding with the Pharoahs...

</b>                         I know just how ya feel.

               Joe leads Curt gently but forcibly toward an incredible maroon 
               '51 Merc that's been lowered and chopped so that the windows 
               are like ominous slits and the whole machine has a submarine 
               quality. Joe opens the door and Curt slides into the white 
               fluffy interior. In the small back window, a metal plaque 
               reads "PHAROAHS."

               The third member of the gang is Carlos, a short little kid 
               about fifteen years old. He appears tougher than the rest 
               with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. Joe heads for the 
               driver's side and Ants and Carlos both go for the front 
               passenger door.

                         man. I got it now. Get in the back.

               Carlos gives Ants a hard look and Ants backs down and climbs 
               in the back with Curt. The Pharoah's Mercury roars out from 
               the curb.

<b>               CRUISING MAIN STREET--PHAROAHS' '51 MERCURY
</b>
               The radio blares "Ain't that a Shame?" as Curt sits in the 
               back seat of the car looking very nervous. He eyes the three 
               hoods cautiously. They are sitting super low, their eyes 
               just visible over the windows.

               Then, Curt happens to look around. He does a double take. 
               Through the narrow window he sees the Thunderbird passing in 
               the opposite direction. Curt swivels and watches through the 
               back window as the T-bird disappears around a corner. Then, 
               he shakes his head. Of all the times to be trapped with the 
               Pharoahs.

               On the radio the Wolfman is giving a phone operator a bad 
               time and the Pharoahs are chuckling.

               As the Wolfman continues on the radio, the cars pass though 
               the night like a metallic ballet. The Pharoahs' Mercury (with 
               Curt aboard) passes Laurie's Edsel...

               Inside the Edsel, Steve is driving. He puts his arm around 
               Laurie and she leans her head on his shoulder.

               As the Edsel cruises by in one direction, John Milner's '32 
               Ford coupe rumbles by on the other side of the street.

<b>               INSIDE THE DEUCE COUPE

               Carol is laughing like mad as the Wolfman continues. Even 
               John has to chuckle at the mad D.J.'s raspy patter.

               In the back seat, Ants nods in agreement.

               Curt tries to smile but looks pretty guilty. Then Joe looks 
               around from the front seat.

               Curt scoots down to a level even with Ants. Ants is staring 
               at him and grinning evilly. Then they hear an incredible 
               roar, and they all turn to see Bob Falfa's black '55 Chevy 
               pass by. Falfa has a new girl with him this time, a lovely 
               redhead.

               Carlos and Ants look at him. Like nobody asked him to open 
               his mouth.

               Milner may not be as fast a he used to be--and having a little 
               teeny-bopper with him isn't helping matters. He looks over 
               at Carol. She's moved closer to him.

</b>                         Don't worry, I won't rape you.

               Carol slides back to her side. But as they glide along, Carol 
               watches John. She's moon-eyed and flipped over him. John 
               deftly down-shifts as he approaches a light and then 
               accelerates through the gears with a "race" expertise.

               There's a honk and John and Carol look over to see a '60 
               Cadillac full of girls laughing at them.

               John nods modestly.

</b>                         In fact, we're gonna give you our 
                         special prize for having the neatest

               The girl suddenly launches a water balloon, which John ducks 
               deftly, the tumescent missile catching Carol full in the 
               face. The girls roar off. John cracks up as Carol blinks 
               away the water, not believing what's happened. She wipes her 
               face.

               Carol jumps out of the car as John stops the car in the right 
               hand lane next to the Cadillac. As Chuck Berry wails "Johnny 
               B. Goode," they go into action.

               The girls in the Cadillac recognize John as one of their 
               victims and quickly roll up all windows and lock their doors. 
               John starts pulling the stems from the front tires, sinking 
               the car. Carol starts around the car with the shaving cream, 
               spraying all their windows with the foamy lather.

               Carol is having a great time and John is laughing as they 
               continue their guerrilla attack. They finish and jump back 
               in the coupe. The light turns green and John takes off, 
               leaving the Cadillac stranded at the intersection, covered 
               with shaving cream. Traffic begins to back up... horns begin

               Eyes for You" playing as the Chevy slowly comes to a stop in 
               an isolated spot along the irrigation canal.

               Terry gets out of the car, pops the top off two cokes and 
               pours half of them into the canal. He hums, refilling them 
               with bourbon. He goes back to the car.

               He hands her one of the bottles and takes a long drink out 
               of the other. He grabs the steering wheel for support and 
               his eyes begin to water.

                         upholstery.

               As they roll around, a couple of guys walk by the car 
               laughing. Terry manages to sit up and watches them go off 
               into the night.

                         around here. Why don't we go someplace 
                         else.

               Debbie pulls him back down on top of her.

</b>                         Wait a minute. I got a blanket in 
                         the back. Why don't we go over into 
                         the field?

</b>                         All right. Okay.

               They both get out of the car. Terry gets the blanket out of 
               the trunk. They walk along a path next to the moonlit canal. 
               Debbie carries their drinks for them. They left the radio on 
               and Wolfman's voice can be heard as he takes another call.

<b>               MINIATURE GOLF COURSE AND ARCADE
</b>
               As the Silhouettes yip-yip-yip-yip into "Get a Job," we see 
               the mysterious white Thunderbirds cruise by and disappear. 
               The Pharoahs' Mercury turns into the parking lot of a a 
               miniature golf course. The doors open and the Pharoahs exit. 
               There's a pause, then Ants reaches into the car and pulls 
               Curt out also. The Pharoahs saunter into the miniature golf 
               compound.

</b>                         Curt.

               Joe gives Curt a gentle push and they go inside. The golf 
               course is empty, except for a couple of ugly girls putting 
               around in the far corner. Under a trellis, Curt and Joe enter 
               as the Pharoahs fool around with the candy machine, pinball 
               games, "Check Your Weight," and "Air Corps Gunner" games, 
               pretending to play with them.  Joe looks around, whistling 
               again.

</b>                         All right, men.

               Quickly the Pharoahs go into action, jimmying locks, pounding 
               coin returns, pulling out plugs, prying open change boxes 
               and stuffing looses coins into their pockets.

               Joe smiles at Curt, who looks sick again, involved now in a 
               robbery. Ants is sitting in a "Rocket to the Moon" ride, 
               pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts. Ants 
               starts bouncing up and down looking dumber than usual. He 
               swears at Rocket to the Moon under his breath--suddenly a 
               screen door slams. The Pharoahs turn. A man in an undershirt 
               stands by the "Get Your Balls Here" booth, regarding them 
               warily.

<b>                                     MR. GORDON
</b>                         What're you punks doing?

               The Pharoahs can't think of anything right away. Ants bounces 
               noisily in the "Rocket to the Moon." The Pharoahs are all 
               looking to Joe for guidance. Joe for his part is mumbling.

<b>                                     CURT

               The man looks at Curt, surprised.

                         these punks?

               The Pharoahs don't know what's happening yet. Curt walks 
               over to Mr. Gordon.

               Mr. Gordon looks skeptical, then Curt smiles at him. Then 
               Mr. Gordon smiles.

               He laughs nervously. The Pharoahs laugh. Everybody's happy.

               Mr. Gordon looks puzzled.

</b>                         I mean, I'm not leaving until

                         check, didn't you?

               He leads Curt toward the screen door. Curt looks around at 
               the Pharoahs, who are slowly starting to work again pilfering 
               the machines. Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands 
               with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder.

               There's a knock at the screen and they turn to see Joe at 
               the screen door.

               Curt and Joe go out through the arcade toward the Mercury. 
               They start walking faster, anxious to get away. Joe grins at 
               Curt as they climb into the car.

               Back in the office, Hank and Mr. Gordon watch the car pull 
               out.

<b>               THE CANAL BANK
</b>
               Steve's Chevy sits near the canal. The door is open and the 
               radio blares, while Terry and Debbie are off somewhere in 
               the weeds making out.

               Suddenly, a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk. 
               Feet approach the car as the light beam moves across the 
               interior and stops on the vacated shoes on the front seat.

               The light beam continues past the empty bourbon bottle and 
               starts int he direction of the field where Terry and Debbie 
               are lost in the throes of passionate love. As we follow the 
               light into the field we hear footsteps.

               As the darkened figure approaches the couple, we see the 
               light go out and catch a gleam of silver in the moonlight as 
               a switchblade springs open!

               Terry reacts to the sound.

</b>                         I thought I heard something.

               She kisses him and he forgets about the noise. The figure 
               retreats back to the Chevy, where another indistinct figure 
               waits.

                         sweat.

               Terry and Debbie are resting in the field, listening to the 
               radio in the distance. A car engine is heard starting up and 
               disappearing down the canal bank.

               The countryside is very quiet. Only crickets and frogs are 
               heard as Terry begins to drop off asleep. He suddenly jumps 
               with a start.

                         lightning or something--anything---
                         but not the car!

<b>               THE CANAL BANK--LAURIE'S '58 EDSEL
</b>
               Cars are seen here and there in the moonlight along the 
               irrigation canal outside of town. In the cars radios are 
               playing "To the Aisle," laughter can be heard in some, 
               whispering in others.

               Laurie's Edsel is parked by the slow-moving water. In the 
               front seat of the car, Steve and Laurie are making out. Laurie 
               leans back against Steve, his arms around her, and they look 
               out the window at the stars...

</b>                         You know, it doesn't make sense to 
                         leave home to look for a home, to 
                         give up a life to find a new life, 
                         to say goodbye to friends you love 
                         just to find new friends.

<b>                                     STEVE
</b>                         What? Say that again, I didn't--

<b>                                     LAURIE
</b>                         That's what Curt said.

</b>                         Oh, figures.
                              (smiling)
                         You must've talked his ear off trying 
                         to get him to stay.

</b>                         That's not true. I didn't say 
                         anything. Curt just said at dinner 
                         tonight he realized there was no big 
                         hurry. He thought he should take it 
                         easy for a while, go to J.C. and try 
                         to figure out what he wants to do 
                         with his life.

</b>                         That sounds logical.

               Laurie's expression changes.

<b>                                     LAURIE
</b>                         You think so?

</b>                         Sure. I think Curt's probably right 
                         for Curt. Not for me though. Laurie, 
                         look at me. Now you know what I want 
                         out of life. And it's just not in 
                         this town.

</b>                         I'm not going to the airport tomorrow.

               She looks sullen and he smiles a little. He turns her around 
               and gently kisses here. They begin to make out, Laurie seeming 
               a little desperate. Steve pushes her slowly down on the seat. 
               He moves on top of here and his hand begins to wander.

</b>                              (quietly)
                         It's our last night together for 
                         three months... come on.

</b>                         I'm going to miss you so much. I 
                         need something to remember you by. 
                         You don't want me to forget you.

               She closes her eyes, trying not to cry.

<b>                                     LAURIE
</b>                              (softly)
                         No...

               He starts to move on top of her, kissing her neck. She 
               struggles for a few moments, then goes limp, not responding. 
               He pulls away angrily.

<b>                                     STEVE
</b>                         What's wrong? You're just lying there.

                         for anything else, why don't you go 
                         ahead?

                         be so damn self-righteous with me. 
                         After those things you told me about 
                         watching your brother--

</b>                         You're disgusting! Get out of my 
                         car! I told you never--

                         care if you're leaving--now get out!

               She reaches past him and pulls the door handle. The door 
               swings open and she shoves Steve out. Then she starts the 
               engine and drives away, leaving Steve standing there in the 
               darkness. In the distance, he hears the laughter of other 
               couples and the drifting music from their radios.

<b>               THE CANAL ROAD
</b>
               Terry and Debbie walk slowly along the dark canal. Terry 
               takes a large slug of his bourbon and coke.

                         Isn't that creepy?

               Terry thinks about it and indeed it is. He looks around into 
               the darkness and then takes Debbie's hand.

</b>                         They thought he went up to Stockton, 
                         but two nights ago they found Carlie 
                         Johnson and Don White right here by 
                         the canal all hacked to pieces and--

                         heads, but he had switched all the 
                         parts of their bodies around. You 
                         know putting her arms on him and his 
                         legs on--

               Terry is slowing and he stops her. He motions for her to 
               shut up and they listen. The wind whines across the flat 
               valley. Ahead there is only darkness, then footsteps!

                         help, you stay here.

               Terry has turned and is starting off when she grabs him by 
               his shirt-tail.

</b>                         Come on, we'll hide in the field.

               She takes Terry's hand and they go off behind some bushes, 
               away from the black water.

               Debbie looks through the bushes, squinting.

                         get somebody and we'll see the whole 
                         thing.

               Terry stands with his eyes closed.

                         very--I think he's coming this way.

               She edges off to get a better view.

                         Debbie!

               She's gone. Terry starts off, taking one step, turns, takes 
               another, turns, takes another. Suddenly Terry hears something 
               behind him. He turns very slowly and looks...

               A figure is standing right behind him, silhouetted by the 
               moon, its face obscured. Terry jumps about three feet and 
               yells.

               Terry and Debbie start to walk with Steve back toward town. 
               Terry keeps taking pulls from the bottle of bourbon.

               He ignores her, and finally his silence makes her take a 
               small round knob out of her pocket and put it back on the 
               shifter where it belongs.

                         he called the cops. Can you imagine? 
                         It was only a little after midnight 
                         and he had the whole police force--

                         the rack until I get a little action.

               John sighs, wondering if he'll ever get rid of her. He looks 
               back at something in the rear view mirror. He speeds up and 
               checks the mirror again.

               Carol looks scared and grabs onto the dash. John suddenly 
               hits the brakes. The deuce coupe noses down and Bob Falfa's 
               Chevy has to swerve abruptly to avoid a crash.

               Falfa pulls the Chevy around and alongside the coupe. He has 
               another new girl with him.

               John gives Carol a very fierce look and she sinks back into

               Falfa revs his engine again. John thinks a moment, then shifts 
               down into first.

               The light changes, and John and Falfa take off, tires 
               screaming. The two cars perfectly in sync, rocket down the 
               block toward the next red light. John starts to slow for the 
               light. Falfa looks over, laughs, and runs the red light. 
               John stops.

                         more than anything right now. Like

               Curt nods.

</b>                         Ya want to join the Pharoahs. Huh? 
                         You can admit it--you'd like to--but 
                         you never dreamed it could be 
                         possible, did you?

               Curt shakes his head slowly.

<b>                                     JOE
</b>                         Well, tonight, I'm goin' to give you 
                         your chance.

               Curt hasn't the slightest idea what Joe is talking about. 
               Joe puts his arm around Curt's shoulders and leads him away, 
               explaining what he has to do, while Ants and Carlos grin.

               In the middle of the used car lot, a patrol car hides among 
               the autos for sale. Inside the car, Holstein sits with another 
               officer who's dozing. Across Holstein's dark glasses, 
               reflections of the kids' cars cruising by can be seen, as 
               Holstein waits to nab somebody.

               Joe approaches the patrol car through the lot. He ducks, 
               carrying a length of metal cable in his hand. Curt wanders 
               behind him. Joe sees him and motions for him to get down.

               Curt ducks down near Joe.

                         With Me."

               The policeman waits for a victim. In the background, we see 
               Curt dodging from behind one car to another. Taking cover, 
               Curt makes another break toward a car--and trips and falls.

               In the cop car, Holstein thinks he hears something. He opens 
               the door and gets out. Adjusting his billy club, he paces 
               around the used car lot officiously, while Curt hides behind 
               a Falcon and peeks out from behind a fender. He sees Holstein 
               walking back toward the squad car. The cop opens the door 
               again and climbs in. The echoing sound of the calls coming 
               over the police radio blend with the Wolfman's howling as 
               cars pass with their radios blaring.

               Curt is inching forward with the cable, toward the squad 
               car. In the background, a slow freight train can be heard 
               starting to move across the valley. Curt ties the cable to a 
               post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car 
               with the cable.

               Underneath the car, Curt inches on his back and then reaches 
               up and attaches the cable to the rear axle of the car.

               miserable and disconsolate about the loss of the Chevy he

               Curt and Joe are on the run toward the Merc. Ants and Carlos 
               jump in as they start their getaway.

               Joe shifts into high gear and is flying down the main drag. 
               Terry and Debbie look startled as they see the Pharoah's 
               Mercury roaring by--and Curt leaning out the door, shouting 
               insanely.

               Terry and Debbie watch the Merc speed suicidally past Jerry's 
               Cherries Used-Car Lot.

               Holstein spots them and the driver starts up the engine of 
               the squad car. THe red lights start flashing and the siren 
               wails. The patrol car shifts into gear and leaps forward. 
               Suddenly, there's a horrendous metallic screech, the patrol 
               car hurtles up and out, airborne for a moment--then noses 
               down and bounces along the pavement, sending out sparks as 
               it slides to a stop.

               The driver is stunned and frozen to the wheel. Holstein 
               manages to remove his dark glasses and looks back. There, 
               sitting quietly in the middle of the parking lot, is their 
               trans-axle and two rear wheels. The patrol car sits on the 
               ground at a twenty degree angle, while its engine whines 
               impotently at top speed.

               On the radio, the all-seeing Wolfman gives an evil laugh--

               And Johnny Burnette takes his cue and croons into "You're 
               Sixteen."

               John has glided off the main drag and into a residential 
               area. Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population 
               sleeps through the night. John pulls the coupe to the curb 
               and turns off the engine. He turns out the lights.

               Inside the car, there's silence. Only the clock ticking. 
               Carol looks over at John a little nervously.

               John looks at her and his arm slides along the back of the

               moving slowly toward her.

               Laurie walks up the drive-in and is about to enter when she 
               stops and watches Steve and Budda. She thinks about going 
               in, then hesitates, watching them.

                         to talk to you. You're leaving 
                         tomorrow. Listen, I gave up a long

                         No problems.

               She smiles at him and he smiles back a little. At the door, 
               Laurie turns and leaves before Steven sees her.

               She gets up and goes back to the counter on her skates. Steve 
               thinks a moment and gets up also.

               little cap.

<b>               MEL'S DRIVE-IN
</b>
               The drive-in remains a raucous roar: Cars coming in from the 
               hop, from the movies, other cars going out to the canal or 
               back out to cruise. Only the car hops, who have developed a 
               late-hour, harried look, suggest it's nearly closing time.

               The Pharoahs arrive. The Mercury swings imperiously into the 
               lot. The radio can be heard as the rumbling engine dies. The 
               Clovers are singing "Love Potion #9."

               Curt jumps out of the Mercury elated. The Pharoahs all climb 
               out and circle him, punching him playfully. Joe holds him 
               while Carlos tickles him and they all laugh.

                         make up your mind.

               Curt nods, thinking about it. Then he shrugs. He looks at 
               the three Pharoahs as they climb back into their maroon 
               chariot.

               Joe laughs and Curt nods. He watches the Mercury pull out 
               and then he wanders back across the drive-in toward his little 
               Citroen.

               As the Wolfman talks on, Curt glances toward the street. He 
               sees the white Thunderbird gliding by. He sits up quickly 
               and tries to start the Citroen--but the machine barely turns 
               over. He keeps trying desperately, but the engine won't catch.

<b>               CRUISING G STREET--'58 EDSEL
</b>
               Laurie drives slowly, alone in the Edsel. On the radio, the 
               Skyliners are lamenting the sad state of things--"Since I 
               Don't Have You." Laurie wipes her eyes, crying with the music. 
               A horn honks. She looks over to see Bob Falfa's car pacing 
               her. He's alone now and grinning at her. Laurie ignores him. 
               They drive along further. Falfa roars his engine, but she 
               still doesn't give him any attention. He gives up and pulls 
               off.

               Laurie thinks a while, pouting. She pulls alongside Falfa at 
               the next light. He isn't looking at her. She toots her horn 
               and he turns. Laurie motions him to pull over.

               Falfa looks surprised. The light changes, and he follows her 
               to the curb. Laurie takes a deep breath, and with a determined 
               look, gets out and walks back to his car. She gets in and 
               closes the door. They start off. He looks over and smiles.

               Falfa is puzzled by the frigidity in the air. He glances at 
               her then back at the road, wondering about this strange chick.

</b>
               A half dozen people are standing around in the parking lot 
               behind the bar. Debbie is sitting on the hood of a car, 
               swinging her legs and chewing gum. The people all seem to be 
               watching something on the ground behind the car. Coughing is 
               heard, then gagging, and the unmistakable sounds of someone 
               being sick.

               At the back door of the bar even the cooks are looking and 
               pointing. We hear more coughing and vomiting. A guy slides 
               up on the hood next to Debbie.

</b>                         I never seen a guy lose so much. He 
                         mustn't have been used to drinking.

                         told me.

               An old man looks at his watch and then up at the stars.

                         who got this sick. Billy Webber. 
                         That was ten years ago. What do you 
                         think that was there, that he had 
                         for dinner?

               More groaning and gaggin is heard. An old woman moves close 
               to the old man and he puts an arm around her sentimentally.

                         He looks like a dog, doesn't he? 
                         Looks like old Ginger.

               The people drift off, leaving Debbie sitting alone on the 
               car. Now, Terry slowly emerges, pulling himself up the hood 
               of the car. His face is white. He lies across the hood trying 
               to catch his breath.

                              nearby and pushes 
                              himself up)
                         Wait a second... hey!

               He staggers across the lot toward Steve's Chevy! Debbie slides 
               off the car and follows him.

                         Look!

               Terry staggers around and looks for the keys. He searches 
               under the front seat and over the visor.

               Must've taken the keys with them.

               John pulls the coupe out of the garage and wheels up to the 
               pumps of the gas station. An attendant nods, looking at the 
               roaring engine.

               John looks at him from inside the coupe and nods slowly.

               John drives the car out of the station and screeches down 
               the street.

</b>
               Terry is fiddling around under the dashboard, trying to hot-
               wire the Chevy. As the wires connect, the radio comes to 
               life and the Wolfman growls.

<b>                                     WOLFMAN (V.O.)
</b>                         Who is this on the Wolfman telephone?

               There's the sound of a phone ringing, then the unmistakable 
               voice of the Big Bopper answering.

<b>                                     BIG BOPPER (V.O.)

               Just then, Terry looks up and sees one large badass looking 
               at him. Terry gets up slowly and sees another big guy standing 
               nearby. The first badass reaches in and grabs Terry by the 
               shirt. He pulls him from the car. Terry is smiling weakly.

               The first badass shoves Terry toward the other badass.

                         I've been sick recently, and this 
                         kind of activity can really be hard 
                         on a guy. Now, easy will you? Easy!

               They throw him back and forth and start to rough him up 
               seriously. Debbie is running around helplessly while they 
               pummel Terry. Then, she sees the yellow deuce coupe passing.

               John glances out his window and notices the fight behind the 
               Come On Inn. He punches it and wheels into a fast U-turn.

               The hoods have quit playing with Terry and are punching him. 
               Terry's still on his feet, mostly because he's drunk and 
               staggering away from a lot of the blows; also, Debbie is 
               screaming and pelting the assailants with her purse.

               John jumps out of the coupe and runs into the parking lot. 
               He grabs one of the punks and turns him--smashing him in the 
               face. The punk lands on his ass. John starts circling the 
               other.

               A good fighter, John lands a couple of blows to the gut and 
               lands him on his can. Both of them crawl off. Terry is lying 
               nearby, drunk, sick and bloodied. Debbie holds his head in 
               her lap. John goes over and kneels by them.

                         or were you with them?

</b>                         What happened, man?

               Terry opens his mouth to start to explain, but it's too hard. 
               He can only moan.

               The drive-in is emptying out finally as the midnight hour 
               approaches and passes. The die-hards and the hard-ups are 
               still wheeling through Mel's looking for remains of any 
               action.

               Steve sits inside in a booth. Two gossipy looking girls come 
               in smiling and slide into the booth across from him.

               The name registers with Steve.

               face swelling, groans as he leans toward the intercom.

               Terry looks at her, his eye swollen, his lip ballooning, his

</b>                         You don't--no car at all. What about 
                         your jeep?

               Terry shakes his head.

</b>                         No car... well, how am I going to 
                         get home?

               Just then the car hop approaches with the two cokes on two 
               trays.

<b>                                     CAR HOP

                         to your car.

               Terry shrugs, standing in the empty stall, the carhop with 
               the trays and Debbie watching. There's a low rumbling sound 
               and the girls turn as John's deuce coupe glides into the 
               stall next to them. Terry shuffles toward John's car, a 
               defeated man.

               Terry leans against John's car and John looks out the window 
               at him.

                         again?

</b>                         It's a shame, Baby. I'll tell yuh... 
                         Got to take it easy when you're 
                         drivin' that car of yours. You got 
                         to cruise easy, baby. Don't be doin' 
                         any accidents or anything on me.

               And the radio plays "Cryin' in the Chapel."

               John smiles and gets out of the car. He goes and opens his 
               hood, making a last-minute check on something. Terry sits 
               down gently on a curb by John. Debbie has been talking with 
               some other boys. Eventually she wanders up slowly and looks 
               at Terry. He looks up at her, then away, disgraced and 
               embarrassed. She sits down by him and they're silent.

</b>                         No, no, really. I really had a good 
                         time. I mean, you picked me up and 
                         we got some hard stuff and saw a 
                         hold-up, and then we went to the 
                         Canal, you got your car stolen, and 
                         then I got to watch you gettin' sick, 
                         and then you got in this really 
                         bitchin' fight... I really had a 
                         good time.

               Terry looks at her, starting to regain a little cool.

               He feels his swollen lip and she touches it. Then she leans 
               over and kisses him.

               She smiles, walks off, swinging her purse. She looks over 
               her shoulder and smiles. He smiles back.

<b>               OUTSIDE RADIO STATION--CITROEN
</b>
               The little Citroen bumps along a lonely dirt road, winding 
               its way through dark peach orchards and wizened grape 
               vineyards. Curt watches the deserted landscape when suddenly, 
               the radio increases in volume and he turns it down. Then it 
               begins to roar and distort eerily as the signal becomes more 
               powerful. Then Curt sees it.

               He stops the car and gets out. He stands looking at an 
               isolated white frame house hitting in the moonlight. Curt 
               looks up at a spidery radio antenna that rises toward the 
               stars, its black wires humming in the stillness.

               Curt starts up the gravel walk to the door. Under the glare 
               of a naked spotlight, he sees a small intercom which plays 
               soft Rock and Roll. He hesitates, then pushes a buzzer. He 
               pushes it again and finally a voice comes over the intercom.

<b>                                     VOICE (V.O.)

                         him before--

</b>                         Listen, I got a right to talk to 
                         him. I listened to him every night 
                         for as long--for twelve years almost. 
                         I know him and it's personal and 
                         it'll only take a minute and I bet 
                         Wolfman would be upset if he knew a 
                         friend couldn't get in touch with--

               A buzzer interrupts him and the door opens an inch. Curt 
               pushes it open slowly--no one is there. A little scared, he 
               goes inside and closes the door.

<b>               INSIDE RADIO STATION
</b>
               Curt walks slowly down a dark eerie corridor, passing 
               strangely lit rooms with electronic generators, humming 
               dynamos and glassed-off booths filled with flashing electronic 
               apparatus.

               Curt goes through this other-worldly maze until he comes to 
               a small, dimly lit control booth. A figure inside is barely 
               visible through the reflections in the double glass windows. 
               The figure turns and walks up to the window. Curt backs off 
               a bit. A face stares at him--long hair greased in a ducktail, 
               a short chinbeard. Then he speaks, his voice filtering 
               strangely through a hidden speaker.

</b>                         What do you want?

               Through the window, Curt can be seen but no sound is heard.

                         on back to the booth.

               Curt walks around through a few more glass doors and ends up 
               in the booth with the manager.

               The manager sits down and leans back, turning a fan to blow 
               on his large chest. He's a large, friendly looking man; he 
               wears a Hawaiian shirt. He sucks on a popsicle. Curt stands 
               awkwardly.

</b>                         No, man. I'm not the Wolfman.

               The manager leans forward and picks up a spool of tape. He 
               holds it up as a magician would for audience inspection, 
               then puts it on a machine. A record is about to end. As it 
               does the manager punches some buttons and the record segues 
               into a Wolfman howl and then the distinctive Wolfman voice 
               takes over. The manager adjusts the monitor volume down and 
               sucks his popsicle.

               and blinking lights of the large console.

               Curt sits down, undecided about leaving and upset about not

                         come in here now and then, with tapes, 
                         to check up on me, you know, and 
                         when I hear the stories he got about 
                         the places he goes. Hell, here I sit 
                         while there's a big beautiful world 
                         out there, don't ya know. Wolfman 
                         comes in last time talking about 
                         some exotic jungle country, handing 
                         me cigars he says was rolled on the 
                         naked thighs of brown beauties. The 
                         Wolfman been everywhere and he seen 
                         everything. He got so many stories, 
                         so many memories. And here I sit 
                         sucking on popsicles.

               Curt looks at him a moment.

                         to the Wolfman, you understand.

               Curt nods and stands. The manager swivels around and punches 
               some buttons, putting on a commercial.

               He turns back.

               He shakes the manager's hand, then wipes it on his pants.

               Curt goes out the door. He starts back out through the maze 
               of windows and electronic machines. Echoing throughout the 
               rooms, the Wolfman's raucous voice follows Curt. The Wolfman 
               howls and Curt turns.

               Through the maze of glass, shifting like prisms, he sees the 
               station manager sitting by the mike--howling! Then, he laughs 
               and howls again, starting to sing a song called "Bluebirds 
               on My Dingaling," pounding out the rhythm on the console.

               He backs away, leaving the Wolfman, who's on his feet now, 
               screaming out the end of the song, dancing by himself in the 
               little glass room, from which his voice radiates out through 
               the night and around the world...

               John is working under the hood of the deuce coupe when Falfa's 
               Chevy drives into the parking lot. The radio is now blasting 
               "Heart and Soul." Terry moves over toward John's car. John 
               doesn't look up, although he is quite aware of Falfa's 
               entrance.

               Falfa slows down in front of John's car and revs his engine 
               again. John looks up--Laurie is in the car with Falfa. She 
               looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is.

               Terry starts to climb into the car. John looks over at Falfa 
               in the rumbling Chevy.

               Falfa grins and gooses the Chevy, peeling out of Mel's Drive-
               in.

               He accelerates the Chevy, shifting up deftly. Laurie looks 
               scared now.

               Steve is cruising along the almost deserted streets looking 
               for Laurie. A T-Roadster pulls up alongside and a guy shouts 
               at Steve.

               off toward Paradise Road.

               Curt pulls into the parking lot just as the neon sign goes 
               out. The last cars are leaving as the drive-in shutters up 
               for the night. Curt stops next to the lighted phone booth 
               and sits in his car, listening to the Wolfman.

               The Wolfman howls and Curt smiles, leaning his chin on his 
               hand, looking around the dark drive-in, wondering about 
               tomorrow.

<b>               PARADISE ROAD--DAWN
</b>
               John's '32 yellow deuce coupe and Falfa's black '55 Chevy 
               are waiting side by side on a long, straight country road, 
               their front wheels resting on a weather-beaten starting line. 
               The sky is getting lighter as the radio plays "Green Onions."

               There are about six to eight other cars parked off the road 
               to watch the race. Everything is quiet now, only the crickets 
               ignoring the solemnity of the scene, and still singing. Terry 
               jumps out of John's car, John hands him the flashlight and 
               he takes up a position in front of the two cars.

               John looks over at Falfa, who's arguing with Laurie.

                         ride with you?

</b>                         Yeah, she's with me. You worry about 
                         yourself, man.

</b>                         Everybody ready?

               John settles back in the driver's seat and positions his 
               hand on the gear-shift, which we see is wrapped with rags 
               because of the missing knob.

               Both drivers start revvin' their engines; the tension builds. 
               Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, 
               his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on.

               Both cars roar off the starting line, tires smoking and 
               screaming. Terry has his hands over his head and is coughing 
               in a cloud of smoke as they pass. John beats Falfa off the 
               line.

               Out on the road, as they hit third gear, the cars are almost 
               neck and neck. Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to 
               death. Falfa looks insane as he tromps it.

               John hits fourth at about eighty-five. Falfa does likewise--
               but starts to fish-tail. Laurie closes her eyes, almost crying--
               Falfa regains control nervously.

               Falfa's engine is winding out incredibly and he begins to 
               get the edge on John. The cars rocket through the dawn light 
               along the flashing white line until suddenly Falfa's car 
               blows a tire, his front wheel slips off and the car shoots 
               off into a tomato field, hits an irrigation ditch and begins 
               flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and smoke--

               John sees the Chevy leaving the road and screams to a halt, 
               swimming through an unbelievable U-turn and high tailing it 
               back to the crash site. He is out of the car like a bullet, 
               running across the dirty cloddy field. The crash car is 
               beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is 
               panicked.

               Meanwhile, the spectators have arrived, including Steve, who 
               jumps from his car and is running across the field.

               Steve and John arrive at the fire at approximately the same 
               time. They stop, the flames are getting higher, burning up 
               into the trees now. Steve looks around wildly--he sees John 
               and goes at him.

<b>                                     STEVE

                         that car! Why did you have--

               He takes a couple of swings at John, who finally manages to 
               tackle him around the waist. They both get up looking at the 
               flaming wreckage. Then John moves around the side, crouching, 
               trying to see past the flames--suddenly, he stands and motions 
               to Steve to come over. They both circle the wreck.

               Around behind the flaming car Falfa is standing in a state 
               of shock watching the car go up in smoke, while Laurie is 
               circling him, screaming and beating him with her purse.

               She beats at him, crying hysterically. Steve runs over and 
               grabs her, pulling her away. She fights at Steve, too, not 
               knowing what's going on.

               Standing in the early light, Steve holds her. She throws her 
               arms around him as the crowd develops along the irrigation 
               ditch to watch the flaming car.

               John looks at Falfa who's shaking his head, watching the car 
               dissolve.

               He pulls him off by the neck of the shirt and when they're a 
               few yards off, Falfa's '55 Chevy does blow--exploding like a 
               small A-bomb, blowing it into Modesto history.

               Back on the road, John is heading toward his car, its engine 
               still running, its door open. Terry runs up, trotting 
               alongside John like a puppy.

               John stops by the open door of the deuce coupe. Terry stares 
               at him and squints against the rising sun.

                         about. It was the most beautiful 
                         thing I've ever seen. That guy, he 
                         might as well get a wheelchair and 
                         roll himself home. Man, you got...

                         John. You're the greatest.

               John nods, then looks up at Terry. His face is glowing, his 
               glasses are smashed and his lip is swollen. John smiles.

                         here.

               John climbs in the car. Terry yawns and shakes his head.

               He climbs in too, and the deuce coupe drives off slowly as 
               the sun rises over the ploughed fields and on the radio we 
               hear "Only You."

               Curt sleeps in the little car as the sky grows lighter over 
               the empty parking lot. The phone is ringing in the booth. It 
               continues to ring. Finally Curt becomes aware of it and opens 
               his eyes. It takes him a moment to remember. Then, panicked, 
               he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth.

               But there's a click as she hangs up. Curt looks at the phone 
               a moment, then also hangs up. From the car radio, he hears 
               the Wolfman making kissing noises.

               A DC-3 prop airliner is warming up its engines as it waits 
               to take off from a small country airport. There aren't too 
               many people around. Just Curt and his friends and family 
               seeing him off. Curt stands with a kindly-looking couple in 
               their fifties. He hugs his mother and shakes hands with his 
               dad.

               Then, Curt moves to his friends. He shakes Steve's hand.

               Curt smiles at Terry, who has a bandage on his forehead. 
               Curt looks at John and they don't seem to know what to say. 
               Finally, John gives Curt a little slap on the cheek.

               He walks toward the plane and they all wave. He looks around 
               as he goes up the steps carrying a small bag and a portable 
               radio. The stewardess smiles as he passes her. Above the 
               door of the plane it reads RADAR EQUIPPED. Curt looks back 
               again, then goes inside. The plane takes off down the runway 
               and then climbs up into the sky.

<b>               INSIDE THE PLANE
</b>
               Curt listens to the radio as the plane takes off. It's playing 
               "Goodnight Sweetheart." As the plane climbs and banks over 
               the valley, the music fades and the station drifts between 
               static and other stations...and then it's gone. Curt turns 
               off the radio and looks out the window.

               As the plane banks, through the window Curt sees the white 
               Thunderbird crossing beneath on the small grey ribbon of 
               highway. Curt watches it. Then the plane's shadow ripples 
               over the car and it, too, is gone.

<b>               THE BLUE SKY
</b>
               As the plane flies off against the blue sky we see cameos of 
               Curt and his friends:

               John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964. 
               Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in 
               December 1965.
