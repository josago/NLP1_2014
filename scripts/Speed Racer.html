</b>
          A battered sneaker tattooed with doodles of speeding cars
          and checkered flags and the words "Start Your Engines!"
          Beats up and down, a sewing machine needle of anxious,
          restless, adolescent energy.
          A pencil fills in the oval of a standardized test form,
          then hesitates, twitching with the speed of a humming
          bird wing caught between two fingers, then is quickly
          erased as a different answer is chosen.
          The form sheet is filled with smudges of uncertainty.
          A ten year old boy stares at the next question.

<b>          TEST QUESTION
</b>
          Grace buys a bag of 240
          jellybeans. There are 35 yellow
          ones, 52 red ones, 63 green ones,
          26 white ones, 41 blue ones and 40
          black ones. If Grace wants to eat
          one of each while keeping her eyes
          closed, what is the minimum number
          she will have to eat?

          His mouth tries to makes sense of the question but it's
          not working.

          He looks around at the other students quietly, diligently
          filling in their ovals while he fidgets, his leg beating,
          his pencil fluttering, a pot jiggling its lid, about to
          boil over.

          He reads the question again. Greek. Chinese. Meaningless.
          He looks up at the clock. The second hand sweeps towards
          the 12. Then back at the test.

          Something suddenly clicks.

           He stares at the clock, pencil poised, waiting until the
          second hand hits the 12 and he's off-
          Filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could
          possibly be reading the questions.

<b>          INT. TEACHER'S OFFICE - DAY - PAST

          Mrs. Racer sits across the desk from Speed's teacher.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          No, that's not exactly right. Your
          son seems to be interested in only
          one thing.
          Mom knows what's coming.

<b>          TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          All he talks about, all he seems
          capable of thinking about is
          automobile racing.

<b>          MOM
</b>          Well you know, his father designs
          racing cars.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          And where is your husband?

<b>          MOM
</b>          He's-working. He couldn't make
          it.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen
          very far from the tree.
          Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher
          glances back to her records.

<b>          TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Is your husband's name Rex?

<b>          MOM
</b>          No, Rex is his older brother. Why?

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          This is the test he turned in last
          week.
          She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on.
          The bottom half of the ovals are filled in to spell out:

<b>          "GO REX GO!"
</b>

          Speed has finished filling in the test and is now drawing
          pictures in the corner of the test booklet.
          He is drawing little race cars,. He flips a few of the
          pages and we see a quick moment of his animation as two
          cars collide.

<b>

</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          He continues to draw as the background of the classroom
          fades to white behind him, becoming the black corner that
          he is drawing on.
          We watch the race going on in his head as hand-drawn cars
          battle each other heading for a photo-finish. Speed
          makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound
          as two cars try to block the Mach 5, smashing into one
          another as --
          The Mach 5 jumps over and through the fiery crash,
          crossing the finish line still in the air.
          Speed is lost in slow-motion revelry, making the sound of
          the roaring crowd.
          The teacher hears him and looks up, frowning as she sees
          him lost in his fantasy world.
          A little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning
          to watch him, a smile creeping across her face; there is
          no one in the entire school like him.
          The teacher is about to say something when the bell
          rings.
          Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up, in motion
          before anyone else.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Alright, pencils down, bring your

<b>          TESTS--
</b>          Thwack! Speed slaps his down and is already heading for
          the door.

<b>          TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          --to my desk.
          Ham! The door slams open and Speed shoots out.

<b>          TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Speed Racer, slow down!

<b>          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
</b>
          Speed slides down the railing on his butt, a perpetual
          motion machine as he scans the street, smiling as he sees-
          Across the street, leaning against his hot rod, his big
          brother, Rex Racer.

</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          He pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool
          cars pass by.
          Here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature
          of the automobile in the world of Speed Racer. In this
          world, the grocery store parking lot looks like a car
          collector show; vintage and concept cars are as
          ubiquitous as the Camry is in our world.
          Speed dashes across the street, a tight parabolic arc
          around the car, his little head sticking up like a shark
          fin circling until--
          The car door pops open and snaps shut.
          The seat-belt clicks into place before Rex even has a
          chance to move. He leans over and looks in the window.
          Speed smiles.

<b>          REX
</b>          .I take it you're ready to go?
          Speed nods. Rex climbs in beside him.

<b>          REX (CONT'D)
</b>          So, who was school?

<b>          YOUNG SPEED
</b>          Fine. Are you going to the track?
          Mom said you were. You don't have
          to drop me off, I could just go
          with you.

<b>          REX
</b>          No way.
          He starts the car and roadster growls to life.

<b>          YOUNG SPEED
</b>          Oh, come on, take me with you.
          Come on, please.

<b>          REX
</b>          I can't, Speed. Pops would kill
          me.

<b>          YOUNG SPEED
</b>          He doesn't have to know. I won't
          say anything. Nobody will know.
          Come on, please, Rex, pleaseplease
          pleasepleasepleeeease.
          Rex sighs, knowing there's no way he can with this.

<b>          REX
</b>          Are you wearing the socks?
          Lickety-split, Speed sticks his sneaker up against the
          dash board and pulls back his pant leg revealing--
          A bright red sock.

<b>          REX (CONT'D)
</b>          You roll us again and this'll be
          the last time? Deal?
          A ten year old's grin spreads ear to ear.

<b>          YOUNG SPEED
</b>          Deal.

<b>          INT. THUNDERHEAD LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT
</b>
          A lone figure sits on a bench away from us; his racing
          suit is unzipped to the waist and he sits with his head
          down as though he was praying.
          He is wearing a pair of bright red socks.
          After a moment, he pulls his boots on, zips up his suit
          and stands looking into the locker.
          Propped against this gloves is a photo of Rex.
          This is Speed ten years later. He takes the photo and
          slides it into one of the zippered pockets of his suit.
          He grabs his gloves and slams the locker shut.

<b>          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST
</b>
          The first gen T-180 screams along the metal raceway.

<b>          INT. CAR
</b>
          Speed sits in Rex's lap, wearing a too-big helmet,
          giggling with a child's mad glee as he steers.

<b>          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT

          The car.banks up a wall and roars down, swooping past.

<b>          INT. CAR
</b>
          Speed screeches as though riding a roller coaster.

<b>          REX
</b>          Feel that shimmy? That's your hind
          legs trying to outrun you're
          front.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          What do I do?

<b>          REX
</b>          Stop steering and start driving.
          Speed gets serious, his lips tightening the way a hand
          knots into a fist.

<b>           REX (CONT'D)
</b>          This ain't no dead piece a metal.
          A car's a living breathing thing.
          She's alive. You can feel her
          talking to you, telling you what
          she wants, what she needs. You
          just gotta listen.
          Speed tries to listen.

<b>           REX (CONT'D)
</b>           Close your eyes and listen.
          Speed does.

<b>           REX (CONT'D)
</b>          They say that Ben burns drove the
          last lap of the '68 Vanderbilt Cup
          with his eye closed.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          No way!

<b>          REX
</b>          No? Well maybe you can't hear it
          then. Maybe. you ought to start
          hitting those books--

<b>          SPEED
</b>          No! I hear it!

<b>          REX
</b>          That so? Okay Mr. Burns, you tell
          me when to gas it for the jump.

<b>           SPEED
</b>          Uh-uh.
          The jump glides towards them as the tires seem to whisper
          to Speed.

<b>          SPEED (CONT'D)
</b>          Now!
          Rex smiles, hitting the gas, launching the car into the
          air where it seems to hang fora moment before rushing
          down at us as we cut--

<b>          EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY -= NIGHT - PRESENT
</b>
          The modern T-180's come flying overhead, slamming down
          against the metal track, scattering bright bursts of
          shooting sparks in their wake.

<b>          INT. MEDIA ROW
</b>
          A long stretch of identical glass cubicles that look down
          at the raceway, where announcer's from all over the globe
          provide color commentary for race fans.
          Thunderhead is a relatively small track and the media-row
          should reflect that while it's big enough to be covered
          in several different languages, it is not nearly as
          important as the majors.

<b>          INT. CAR
</b>
          Inside the cockpit of a racing car that feels more like a
          fighter jet, Speed does the thing he was born to do.
          Though the vibrations are enough to rattle molars loose,
          there is a calmness, a preternatural ease in Speed's
          manner that suggests this maelstrom of velocity is where
          he belongs.
          He hears a voice in his headset.

<b>          SPARKY
</b>          Head's up,.Speed! Seven o'clock. I
          got Snake drafting.Pitter-pat.
          Speed looks into his mirror and sees a car with orange
          and black markings, stacked up tight behind another car.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          I got him.

<b>          EXT. TECH PIT
</b>
          It is smaller than a typical crew pit since the cars
          don't really pit. There is a panel like a sound mixing
          board filled with needled gauges and green-barred light
          meters.
          Sparky is watching through binoculars.

<b>          SPARKY
</b>          I figure he'll slingshot after you
          in the next turn.

          The cars explode into the next turn when Snake uses the
          draft to slingshot by the car ahead of him--
          Hurling like a bullet straight at Speed as--
          Speed thumbs a button on his steering wheel causing jacks
          to shoot out of the bottom of the car and sending it up
          into the air just as--
          Snake flies under it, careening into the bottom of the
          turn too tightly, bouncing of the rail, out of control,
          ricochetting back at Speed as--
          He turns his wheels, catching a part of Snake's car with
          the grace of a bull-fighter, sending it spinning away
          towards the other cars while--
          Speed rockets free--
          Eliciting a huge roar from the crowd.

<b>          EXT. TECH PIT

          Sparky smiles.

          Speed careens through a butterfly turn like there was a
          slot-guide in the track causing another crowd roar.
          They can feel that something special might be happening.

          the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the
          past.

          Rex drives the older model T-180, a man on a mission,
          dominating the race exactly like Speed.

<b>          EXT. GRANDSTANDS

<b>          YOUNG SPEED

          Pops checks his watch but almost can't believe it. He

</b>
          Rex blazes by, the track rattling like a metal roller-

          Speed.

          wearing his too-big helmet making his big head seem
          ridiculously enormous.
          Zipping past, he suddenly notices the girl in the pink

          about her--
          Maybe it's way she's got her fists up, like a boy, or

          Cosmopolis. Beyond the standard health club fare, there
          is a Martial Arts gymnastics group in a standing pyramid.
          There is also a range of strange devices ranging from the

<b>          SPEED
</b>          This isn't an easy decision for
          me, Mr. Remmington. For my family,
          racing is everything. We eat,
          drink, think and breathe racing.
          There is nothing more perfect than
          a picnic at Thunderhead. I mean, I
          was taught to drive before I could
          walk. But when my brother died,
          all that went away. I can't tell
          you how painful that was. It
          nearly killed all of us.

          there was Pops, in his beat up
          robe, watching some old race
          recordings.
          The blue tv light of Speed's memory fills his eyes.

          of he '43 Prix and all of a sudden
          Pops started screaming, and then I
          started screaming, and as Burns
          and Dugazi duked it out, heading
          for the finish, we were cheering
          our heads off and the second the
          black and white came down, we
          looked at each other and right
          there we realized the naked truth;
          racing is in our blood.

          and in our house, the Major

          Prix. One of the great finishes in
          the history of racing, right?
          Everyone remembers Burns and
          Dugazi slugging it out, but who
          remembers Carl Potts? Driving a
          rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne .
          Industries, Potts spun out in the
          second lap and went down as a DNF.
          A forgettable and pathetic finish.
          So bad, that afterwards Iodyne
          stock dropped six points.
          Again we see the history told in flashback.

<b>          REMMINGTON (CONT'D)
</b>          Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling
          cold fresh milk in victory lane, a
          thousand cameras taking his
          picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw
          almost a twelve point gain which
          immediately block Penninsula Power
          Cell from being able to afford the
          price of a complete take-over.
          This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of
          Iodyne Inc. in the exact position
          he wanted to be in. By first
          buying controlling interest in his
          own company at a devalued price,
          he then brokered a merger with
          Sirrus that immediately sent
          Iodyne into the gains record book--
          the only record book that matters.
          Look out that window, there isn't
          a single plane or helicopter or K-
          Harrier that isn't powered by
          Iodyne fuel cells. That's what
          racing is about. It has nothing to
          do with cars, or drivers. All that
          matters is power and the
          unassailable might of money.
          His greed is as tangible as any drug.

          Speed doesn't want to hear any more of this, but,
          Remmington is far from done.

<b>          REMMINGTON
</b>          Do you understand? Burns knew he
          was going to win. It was already
          decided. A week before the Prix,
          Goldman and Sirrus met with
          several other major players at the
          Carlyle Hotel. They met there as
          they had for years, just as their
          fathers had met, and as their sons
          and heirs will still meet. They
          met to negotiate the finish order
          of the Grand Prix. No race is more
          important and no race is more
          controlled. That year Goldman was
          supposed to win, but he knew if he
          sold his win to Sirrus, whatever
          that win might be worth, was
          nothing compared to what could be
          gained.

          you are now seeing is controlled
          by the Major Sponsors and they

<b>          SPEED
</b>          What do you want with me?

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          You're familiar with the driver
          Katsu Okamoto?

<b>          SPEED
</b>          Of course.

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          For years he has been contracted
          by a Fixer named Cruncher Block
          who we know works for Remmington.
          Recently, Katsu has been forced to
          lose races that have led to a
          droop in the stock price of
          Okamoto Engineering. We believe
          this is a part of a corporate
          strategy to allow Mushi motors to
          buy control of Okamoto. Katsu
          doesn't want this to happen and he
          began resisting, thinking.that he
          could do it on his own. After
          Fuji, he realized he needed help.

<b>          POPS
</b>          ,Why help him?

<b>          INSPECTOR DETECTOR
</b>          Because he has a file with enough
          information to connect Block to
          Remmington which could put both of
          them behind bars for the rest of
          their lives. The problem is, he
          won't give us the file unless we
          help him stop the take over of his
          family's company.

          will catapult Okamoto Engineering
          back into the spotlight and double
          the cost of the buy out which
          should kill it.

          the nearest cars it is immediately apparent that they are
          no longer driving protectively or defensively--

          Snake blocks him, setting up an attack by one of his team
          but this just allows Racer X a hole to punch through.

          almost over the edge, causing her to shriek from the
          force of the blow--
          And Speed loses it.
          His jaw clenches, shifting into a whole new level of
          intensity.
          He becomes a cyclone, a whirling dervish, enveloping the
          HydroCell team in a cloud of chaos---
          Throwing, rending,. ripping through them until only Snake
          is left.
          Speed is not kind; battering him until he's not sure if
          he's going forward or backward.
          In a panic, Snakes reaches for a hidden lever but before
          he can take hold of it, Speed clobbers him again, causing
          him to shriek louder than Trixie and then--

          Moon-white sheaves mottled against coke-bottle colored
          ice floes rise up, a glistening wall of glacial plates
          surrounding the thin ribbon of road.
          Speed enters the first series of caves bored through
          earth and ice, a stroboscopic oscillation of light and
          dark, ads and no ads as---
          The memory of watching Rex disappear down the throat of

          It is obvious that the conditions are much more

          Each of the drivers, skidding, wobbling, drifting farther
          then they anticipated, but--
          The Okamoto team are just too good, eliminating one and
          then the other HydroCell cars until--

          the road with a fresh shimmering glaze of ice that---
          Speed hits going full throttle, immediately spinning

          The wall of the cliff is not completely vertical and the
          Mach-5 begins to rub against the ice.
          Speed reacts immediately, hitting one of the control
          buttons and--
          Crampons shoot out of his tires, giving him just enough
          of a hold to try--

          Speed roars up after him and Snake grabs for his lever
          again but now it's Speed that's ready--
          Jumping over the ice, he body slams Snake, sending him
          hard into the rail as Speed shoots into the lead.

<b>          EXT. THUNDERHEAD

          Without the lights or banners or crowds, the race track
          echoes with the same quiet portance as a cathedral. It
          is here that Speed has always found himself.
          But as he sails through neck snapping turns with reckless
          abandon, it becomes clear that he is chasing something
          that he has lost.
          He seems ready to cry for all the frustration and anger,
          wanting so badly to undo the last few weeks of his life.
          Suddenly in his rearview mirror there is an answer to his

          the ghost of his brother but when the two cars kiss up
          against each other, Speed realizes this is no ghost--
          It's Racer X.
          The masked Racer suddenly becomes the focus of all his
          anger and Speed swings his car, wielding it like a club,
          trying to clobber him.
          Racer X dodges the first blow and swings back, the two have
          at one another, banging, shoving one another into the wall--
          Until Speed can't take it anymore and he goes at X as
          ferociously as he can, throwing him into a tailspin--
          Crashing him into one of the grand stands.
          Silence embraces the track.

          far.

          From what I've read, that's all he
          tried to do.

<b>          SPEED
</b>          And what good did it do? He got

</b>          Don't try to stop me.

</b>          I want you to know that I acted

          protects me from making an ass out
          of my self but I was determined to
          do it this time and I guess I did

<b>          POPS
</b>          The truth was, I couldn't have

          because you won, but because you
          stood up, you weren't afraid and
          you did what you thought was
          right.

<b>          SPEED

          It was completely meaningless.

          saw my son become a man. I
          watched him act with courage and
          integrity and drive the pants off
          of every driver on the road. This
          is not meaningless. This is the

          I was afraid that what happened to
          Rex was going to happen to you.
          And I just couldn't take that. I
          couldn't loose another one of my
          boys like that again. But what I
          realize in Cortega was that I
          didn't lose Rex when he crashed, I
          lost him here. I lost him when he
          walked out of this house and I let
          him go without telling him how
          proud I was of him and how much I
          loved him. I let him think that a
          stupid motor company meant more to
          me than he did. You'll never know
          how much I regret that mistake,
          but it's enough that I'll never

          if I wanted to keep building cars.
          Then, do you remember when we sat
          here, that night, watching old Ben
          Burns and Dugazi? You remember

<b>          SPEED
</b>          That race. The '43 Prix. Burns
          and Dugazi? It was fixed.
          Remmington told me the whole
          story. It was all about some DNF
          names Rotts. They've known the
          winner of every Grand Prix for the
          past 50 years. It's always fixed.

          The Prince tries to sight the Ghost in his mirrors but

</b>          I'm everywhere, baby!
          Wham! The Ghost is on him, pouncing, slipping into what
          feels like a shoulder throw that sends the Prince
          spinning out of control onto the onrushing Nitro--
          Shattering the Prince's car like a mis-struck diamond
