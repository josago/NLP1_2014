          Coolio's "Fantastic Voyage" blasts.

          About ten thirteen-year-old boys are lined up along the side.
          'Hair down to their ears and parted in the middle-- little
          versions of Kurt Cobain or Jord Catalano.

          They are staring at a group of dancing girls - In the middle
          is KATIE, the blonde who grew boobs before anyone else. And
          every time she moves; she bounces.                 

                         

                         

                         
          The boys watch her, serious, concentrating. They need to
          remember this for later. Katie continues to bounce- One boy

          old, Adam Kurtzman. He's the only boy not looking at Katie.
          Instead, he's staring off in another direction.

          On the other side of the dance floor, next to an 'enormously '
          fat kid, there's Emma. She's an awkward 12. Wearing borrowed
          clothes- a skirt that's a little too long, a top that she
          can't fill out. She's taller than any of the boys. But 
          there's something in her eyes, like she's laughing at
          everything.
