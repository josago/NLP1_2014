<b>          EXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY
</b>
          Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station
          make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a
          ghost town â€˜cept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages
          ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea
          how long ago this place went dry.
          Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending
          PLUMES of dust skyward.

<b>          INT. OLD CHEVY - DAY
</b>
          Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab.
          FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING
          MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and
          FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron.

<b>                         FUCKING DRIVER
</b>          Goddamned old man!

<b>                         FUCKING PASSENGER
</b>          I thought he was dead! She said he
          was dead!

<b>                         FUCKING MIDDLE

          They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for
          the main road in the distance when they round a corner --
          --to face a â€˜70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine
          screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because
          these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before:

          The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM!
          The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would

          Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but...
          KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel.
          Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust
          SWIRLS around the two vehicles.
          The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front!
          The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the
          dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING.

</b>          Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open.
          Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy.
          Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes
          Milton, tire iron held high over his head!
          Milton spins and KUH-FOOM!
          --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger

          Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.

<b>                         ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>          As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He
          got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the
          windshield. He looks up --
          -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.

<b>                         FUCKING MIDDLE
</b>          I'll never tell you where they've
          taken her...NEVER.

<b>                         MILTON

          The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.

<b>          ON FUCKING DRIVER
</b>          As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece
          of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up
          at Milton standing over him.

<b>                         FUCKING DRIVER
</b>          You...you took my leg you fuck!
          Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.

          Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits
          up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.
          Milton spins and KAFOOM!
          Blows Fucking Passenger to hell.

<b>                         FUCKING DRIVER
</b>          But you're too late. You gotta

          dead and hell will walk the earth--

<b>          WHAM!
</b>          Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,
          breaking a couple teeth in the process.
          Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched
          his thirst in a decade.

<b>                         MILTON

          that? I'm coming to get her back.
          You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna
          kill every last one of you fuckers.
          Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't
          look back.

<b>          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY
</b>
          Black smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner.
          It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot
          dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound â€˜67
          GTO stands out.

<b>          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY
</b>
          Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of
          those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
          PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
          couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
          Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
          kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
          joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
          scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          So I tell him, I says, â€œFrank,
          that's it. No more free milk. You
          gonna have to buy the cow you son
          of a bitch.â€�

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          Wha? No, NormaJean, â€œbuy the cow.â€�
          Marry me? He's got to marry me.
          I'm sayin I cut him off.

<b>                         NORMAJEAN
</b>          You cut him off?

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          Not just yes but hell yes! No
          tits, no ass. And I told him if I
          see that big ol' dick of his
          anywhere near my face I'm gonna
          bite it in half.
          Normajean giggles with embarrassment.

<b>                         NORMAJEAN
</b>          You said that? How long's it been?
          Piper frowns.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          Well, it's only been two days but
          that's like a decade in horny
          fucker years.

<b>                         NORMAJEAN
</b>          So he bought you a diamond?

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          A diamond? God no. If Frank had
          money for a diamond I would have
          jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
          put this shithole life in the rear
          view. But he did get down on his
          knees and ask me to be his bride.

<b>                         NORMAJEAN
</b>          No way.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          Yes way!
          NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.

<b>                         NORMAJEAN

</b>
<b>          I KNOW!
</b>
<b>          FF-FF-FFUMP!
</b>          Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
          Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          Did...did you just throw scrambled
          eggs at us?

<b>                         FAT LOU
</b>          I don't pay you bitches to stand
          around. Now get the fuck back to work!
          Piper snatches one of the plates.
          She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
          toward the newly arrived customers.
          The American Indian couple scans a menu...
          ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
          quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
          NormaJean steps up to Milton.

<b>                         NORMAJEAN
</b>          Hello beautiful, coffee?

<b>                         MILTON
</b>          That'd be great. Tell me,
          Stillwater Marsh around here?

<b>                         NORMAJEAN
</b>          (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
          a bell. I'll get that coffee.
          But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
          She quickly looks away. She knows something...
          Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
          --Piper approaches the American Indian couple.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
          you something to drink?

<b>                         MOTHER MARY

<b>          7.

</b>          â€œShe's a Brickhouseâ€� breakfast.
          Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.

<b>                         MOTHER MARY
</b>          And five waters.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          Five waters. And what can I get for...
          Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.

<b>                         MOTHER MARY
</b>          That's it. Just the pancakes. If
          that's okay?
          Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
          they're hungry. And broke.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          Oh. Of course. Coming right up.
          Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
          Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
          attention. She's ignoring him.
          Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          One brickhouse.
          She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
          kept fresh within a glass cake stand.

          Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.

          Friendly even.
          He loosens his tie, slips his jacket off and tosses it over

          Indian Mother Mary turns. Piper's replacement. She stops in

          Piper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat.
          She sits up slowly. Her eyes are blackened. But clearly
          Milton has cleaned her up. She props herself on an elbow,
          looks at the jacket covering her.
          Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky.
          Piper looks.
          The MOON hangs a few days from full.
          Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her,
          then slips into it, wrapping herself as if cold.

          As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back

          beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye
          but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.
          He glances at Milton then --

          SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him

          embeds into the wall!
          The Accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat, tosses

          His hand shoots beneath his pillow as--

          MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into the room.
          Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon!

          body to shield her as his 357 THUNDERS twice!
          Shotgun's eye vaporizes in a mist! He drops to his knees.
          Man with Axe clutches his throat...blood gushing...turns and

          Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty carpet. Milton rolls
          Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on the floor.
          COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can't see
          Milton. Because he's hidden by the bed.

          TWO BULLETS slide into the 357. Chamber SNICKS shut.
          Milton aims under the bed. FIRES!
          Half the man's foot is blown to hell! He hops then crashes
          to the floor!
          He and Milton make eye contact beneath the bed...a nanosecond

          Milton stares down into Candy's face.
          Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and
          opens her eyes.

          Sedan. He POPS the trunk and grabs a gym bag. As he crosses
          toward the Driver's side door...
          The gym bag starts to CRY.

          Jonah King turns, freezes.
          Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser,
          staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag.
          For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career
          maker. News. Media. Leno. Then--
          The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He
          ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag.

          He walks by them towards the front door of the bar.
          Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building.
          Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at
          the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the
          gym bag, engine ROARS to life.

          Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire!
          The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and
          shoot back!

<b>          FFFUMP!

          across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he stumbles,
          falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes
          spilling from within.

          Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun
          lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter.
          We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any
          old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the
          metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry.
          She reaches for it.

<b>                         ACCOUNTANT

          Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the
          darkness behind him.

<b>                         MILTON

          Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply
          the warden of a very large prison.
          Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful.
          Well read. I happen to know the
          idea of sacrificing children in his

          makes my job easier. You get what
          you want, I get what I want.

          arrogance through the orgy around him, his followers turn to
          him with reverence. His name is WHISPERED like a secret.
          He approaches the make-shift stone altar where Skanky Gal
          holds the baby within a bundle of blankets.

          grown attached to the baby.
          Jonah takes the baby, places her on the stone altar.

          be reborn. As we will be. We who
          have survived the slings. The
          arrows. The revulsion of those too

          out. And hunted. But no more.
          Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck.
          Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably
          elegant once. Now it is worthless. He hands it to Jonah.
          The Followers GASP in holy awe.

          another frontal assault. Their bodies RIDDLED with lead.
          The Cultists circle him to get a better shot.
          A Magnum is thrust into the driver's side window - right in
          Milton's face.
          He leans back just as the gun is FIRED. Milton yanks the
          wheel, reverses the Nova - wrenches the Magnum from the
          fucker's hand. The Cultist hangs on. Claws at Milton.
          Milton twirls the Magnum, gunslinger style. Jams the barrel
          into the Cultist's face and FIRES.

</b>          I'm curious. Would you have let
          him do it?
          She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing...

<b>                         ACCOUNTANT
</b>          That's what I thought.
          He turns and walks away from her.

<b>                         ACCOUNTANT
</b>          See you. Soon.
          Skanky bolts. Races off into the darkness.

</b>          Milton...no...
          Milton struggles. His head lolls back and forth. Eyes flick
          around. Searching.

<b>                         MILTON
</b>          Where...where is she?

<b>                         ACCOUNTANT
</b>          She's here.
          The Accountant hands the baby to Milton.
          Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes.
          Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way.
          He places her in Piper's arms.

<b>                         MILTON
</b>          Keep her safe.

<b>                         PIPER
</b>          I will. Anyone tries to hurt her
          and I'll kill'em.

<b>                         MILTON
</b>          I know. That's why I chose you.

          As long as he can. And he'll keep
          trying long after he can't.

</b>          Milton. This can't...you can't
          just give up. There's gotta be
          something we can do to...

<b>                         MILTON

          happen. I'm askin more than I have
          a right to. I know it. But love
          her for me, Piper. Love her and

          Milton coughs.

<b>                         MILTON
</b>          Thank you.
          And like that. The life fades from his eyes.
          Piper holds the baby close, SOBS.
          She looks up at the Accountant. But he is gone.

          The sun glows to the east as --

          Milton sits up slowly. Bones CREAK. He holds his hand out.
          The Accountant takes it. Pulls him to his feet.
          They turn and walk toward the rising sun.
          They walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright
          yellow glow...then...
          ...they fade into the shimmering heat...
