<b>          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
          AIBILEEN, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green
          kitchen. She wears a yellow dress with black piping and
          grips a tattered spiral notebook.
          Although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear.
          Three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: John F.
          Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and an UNKNOWN YOUNG
          BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses.
          Aibileen swallows hard.

           Plantation in Cherokee County.
          An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.

<b>           WOMAN (O.C.)
</b>           Did you know as a girl, growing up,
           that one day you'd be a maid?

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           Yes, ma'am. I did.

</b>           Momma was a maid. My grandmother
           was a house slave.

<b>           WOMAN (0.C.)
</b>           Oh.
          The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes.

<b>           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
</b>           A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay.
          Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap.

<b>           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
</b>           Now, did you ever dream of being
           something else?
          Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet.

<b>           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
</b>           Well then, what's it feel like, to
           raise a white child when your own
           child's at home...being looked
           after by somebody else?

          Aibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water.
          She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male.

          MAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, lies in a crib, crying.
          AIBILEEN enters. Her dark black skin contrasts angelically
          with a brilliant white work dress, white panty hose and shoes

          Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into
          her expansive bosom.

          kisses her and whispers in her ear.

          Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters
          wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and
          double-stick tape hold it all together.
          Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle
          hair.

          Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good
          twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head.

          BLACKLY, 68. He has greased, grey hair and the face of a
          mean man. Smoke pours into the room.

<b>           MR. BLACKLY
</b>           Shut the Goddamn door!
          He snaps his fingers over a chair. Skeeter sits down.

          Skeeter quickly hands Mr. Blackly a resumé. He skims it
          over, marking it violently with a red pen.

          Skeeter nods slowly. She takes a deep breath and pulls a
          letter out of her satchel. She hands it to Mr. Blackly.
          Mr. Blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly,
          mouthing the words as he does. He drops the letter on his
          desk, and looks to Skeeter, flabbergasted.

          Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack
          of potatoes.
          Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her

          Aibileen mouths "I love you" and blows her a kiss.

          The Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom "ranch" is
          destined to become income property one day.
          FIVE YOUNG WOMEN, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two
          collapsible card tables arranged in the living room.
          Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken
          salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table. The table has a
          small L-SHAPED CRACK in the middle.

          Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat.

          Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat.

          deviled eggs.
          Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared
          coat. The sleeves are about a foot too short.

          deep breath and belts out her news.

          Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink
          fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers.
          As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the
          Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround
          a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison.
          Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of
          the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui.

          The Phelan's new maid, PASCAGOLUA, 40, rolls a cart of
          casseroles around the table.
          Charlotte sits at the head of the table. She's having a bowl
          of broth.
          Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60.

          As Charlotte leaves the room, Rebecca looks at Skeeter like

          Skeeter gets up and storms off into the entry foyer.

          Skeeter's father and brother race down the stairs with
          suitcases. Carlton wears a varsity sweater.

          Constantine stands tall. Her skin is black as night. Her
          eyes have a striking honey colored hue to them. She wears a
          white sleeping gown.

          truck's interior at a stubborn 115 degrees.
          Skeeter has no choice but to lower her window. The
          Shinolator meets its match.
          A mangy, STRAY CAT suddenly jumps out in the road. When

          Hilly, her husband, WILLIAM, and Skeeter's date, STUART
          WHITWORTH, drink high balls and eat cheese in the Holbrook
          parlor. Gold swag curtains hang on the windows.
          Balding and pudgy, only William's family money once made him
          a desirable bachelor. Stuart, on the other hand, is very
          handsome, the "Marlboro Man" in a well-tailored suit.
          Yule May (who we met earlier at church with Aibileen) now
          works for Hilly. She clears empty glasses.

          Hilly pats William's leg then turns with concern to a
          grandfather clock announcing half past the hour.
          The front door flies open. Skeeter enters completely out of

          Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby
          shower.
          A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white
          linens and Hilly's best sliver.
          Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear
          bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy
          pools.
          Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs
          with a sterling crumb scraper.
          Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks
          distended crammed inside last year's one piece.

<b>                          ELIZABETH

</b>           You know she can hear you,
           Elizabeth?
          Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the
          scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley.

</b>           Well...You. Are. Welcome.
          Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into
          Hilly and hugs her.

<b>           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
</b>           One thing I got to say about Miss

           beautiful. Can't go more than ten
           minutes without givin' one a kiss.
          Hilly kisses her son gently.

<b>           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           And, law, do they love her back.
           When she starts up on me, I just
           try and think a my sweet Treelore
           and how much he loved me. That
           kind a love makes me cry. Even
           when it going to Miss Hilly.
          Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically
          at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out.

          Miss Myrna letters. Aibileen is dressed very nicely.
          Several flower arrangements are placed around the room. An
          unwrapped present rests on the coffee table.

          As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's
          front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a
          wall clock and smiles.
          About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the
          mail slot.
          Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.

          next to Skeeter.

          along with a picture of the Spears family. Aibileen reads
          the card aloud.

          Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is
          touched.
          The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A
          delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers.
          Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out
          of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in
          matching dresses jump out behind her.
          The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen
          waves back and smiles.
          Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for
          Skeeter. She wipes her eye.

<b>          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - KITCHEN - 6 MONTHS EARLIER
</b>
          We continue with the earlier flashback where Minny arrives at
          Hilly's with her famed chocolate pie. Hilly leads Minny into
          the kitchen, Missus Walters follows behind.
          Hilly slices a big piece and grabs a fork. She leans against
          the counter and takes a big bite.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Nobody wanted to hire a sass-
           mouthing, thieving nigra, did they?
          Minny stands silent as Hilly finishes in three bites.

<b>                          HILLY (CONT'D)
</b>           Pie's as good as always, Minny.

<b>                          MINNY
</b>           I'm glad you like it.
          Hilly cuts another piece for herself.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           If...I take you back, I'll have to
           cut your pay five dollars a week.
          Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly.

<b>                          MINNY
</b>           Take me back?
          Hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           What do you put in here that makes
           it taste so good?

<b>                          MINNY
</b>           That good vanilla from Mexico...
          Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile.

<b>                          MINNY (CONT'D)
</b>           And...something else real special.
          Missus Walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie.

<b>                          MINNY (CONT'D)
</b>           No, Missus Walters. That Miss
           Hilly's special pie.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Momma can have a piece.
          Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter
          toward Minny. Minny stops it before it falls to the floor.

<b>                          HILLY (CONT'D)
</b>           Cut her one.

<b>                          (IMMEDIATELY)
</b>           Eat my shit.
          Hilly calmly sets her plate down on the counter.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           What did you say?

<b>                          MINNY
</b>           I said eat my shit!

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Have you lost your mind?!
          Minny moves toward Hilly.

<b>                          MINNY
</b>           No. But you're about to,
           `cause you just did.
          Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's slice.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Did what?
          Missus Walters immediately gets it. She bursts out laughing
          so hard she has to lower herself to the floor.

<b>                          MISSUS WALTERS
</b>           Well, Hilly, that's what you get, I
           guess. And you didn't just eat
           one. You ate two slices!
          Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in.
          As Minny leaves, Hilly runs to the sink and throws up.

           I just wanted to see her take a
           bite and leave so I could be done
           with her. Forever! She was never
           supposed to ask me back.
          Minny eyes narrow.

</b>           And, then for less pay! That got
           me even madder. And, then she went

          Aibileen looks to Skeeter shaking her head. Minny suddenly
          gets misty. She wipes her eyes.

          The African Children's Benefit Ball is well underway.
          The energy and look of the two hundred attendees feel like a
          throwback to the women's suffrage movement. Many older women
          wear heavy long black skirts and jackets.
          Hilly wears swathes of maroon-colored taffeta. Ruffles
          clutch her throat. She stands next to Jolene French and a

<b>          WLBT CAMERAMAN.
</b>          Dressed to the nines, Jolene raises a microphone and looks
          into the camera.

          Three dozen servers stand in a line. Minny and Aibileen are
          among them.
          Tables are covered with items donated for the auction.
          On the baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie
          promises to again be a big money maker.
          Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom. Celia wears a hideous,
          pink and silver sequined gown. As usual, Celia's breasts
          command attention.
          The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her
          dress and jiggle across the ceiling.
          A TITILLATED OLD HUSBAND tips his martini onto his wife's
          shoe.

</b>           Do you think I might have

          Minny pulls Aibileen aside and points to Celia.

<b>                          MINNY
</b>           Look what she got on.
          Celia grabs more champagne from a passing server.

           hold onto they husbands tonight.
          Celia catches eyes with Minny. She smiles and nods quickly
          and then looks away, careful not to tip off Johnny of their
          relationship.

          Skeeter enters with Stuart. She wears a long-sleeved black
          velvet dress and her hair is being somewhat cooperative.

<b>                          AIBILEEN

          Missus Walters enters wearing a floor-length blue beaded
          gown, circa 1943. A white orchid wilts at her clavicle.

          Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen.
          They all immediately look away.
          Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking
          her head back and forth.

          As Minny and Aibileen enter the church. Four-hundred members
          stand at once. The congregation begins to clap.

          Minny and Aibileen look around trying to figure out the
          source of adulation. They both start clapping too.
          Aibileen steps up to a woman in the last pew.

          The woman raises a copy of "The Help." Aibileen notices a
          copy of the book in each member's hand.
          Aibileen looks to Minny, realizing she's in on it.
          A REVEREND approaches, hands Aibileen a copy of the book.

</b>           Aibileen, this is an important time

           you couldn't put your name in here,
           so we all signed our own.
          The Reverend then hands her a box wrapped in white paper,
          tied with a blue ribbon.

          through her signed book.

          Skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading
          the Harper and Row offer for the hundredth time.
          Tires crunch gravel down the drive. Skeeter sees a car
          moving toward her with the headlights off.
          Worried, Skeeter looks toward her home. Charlotte can be
          seen in an upstairs window.
          Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's.
          Hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car.
          Skeeter charges toward her.

<b>                          SKEETER

          Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.

          Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain
          to contain a newly developed layer of fat.
          A horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip.

          Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.

          Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.

          Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.

</b>           And that...that is horrendous.

           eating too many...SWEETS?
          Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte
          moves in for the kill.

          Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother,
          not knowing what to say.
          Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into
          the living room.
          Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays
          gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away.

</b>           You check in Mae Mobley's bed? She
           been putting things-

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Do you hear her, Elizabeth? She's
           trying to blame it on a toddler.
          Elizabeth won't look at Aibileen.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           I ain't stole no silver.
          Elizabeth whispers to Hilly.

<b>                          ELIZABETH
</b>           She says she doesn't have them.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Then it behooves me to inform you
           that you are fired, Aibileen. And
           I'll be calling the police. They
           know me.
          Mae Mobley enters the room.

<b>                          MAE MOBLEY
</b>           Aibee, my froat hurts.
          Mae Mobley coughs.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           I go get her some syrup, Miss
           Leefolt.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Elizabeth can take care of her
           child.
          Elizabeth looks to Hilly, appearing somewhat upset with this
          suggestion.

<b>                          ELIZABETH
</b>           I'll go get the couch syrup.
          Hilly glares at Aibileen as Elizabeth runs down the hall.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           I won't tolerate liars!
          Mae Mobley becomes scared and hides behind Aibileen's leg.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           I didn't steal no silver.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           I'm not talking about silver. I'm
           talking about those things you
           wrote about Elizabeth. Maybe I
           can't send you to jail for what you
           wrote, but I can send you to jail
           for being a thief. And your
           friend, Minny? That nigra's got a
           nice surprise coming to her.
           Johnny Foote listens to what I say.
           She's as good as-
          Aibileen shouts, interrupting Hilly.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           Woman!...I know something about
           you. Don't you forget that.
          Hilly narrows her eyes.

<b>                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
</b>           From what Yule May says, they's a
           lot a time to write letters from
           jail. Plenty a time to write ever
           person in Jackson the truth about
           you, and the paper is free.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Nobody would believe something you
           wrote.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           I don't know. Already sold a lot a
           books.
          Fear floods into Hilly's eyes.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           Get out of here!

<b>                          MAE MOBLEY
</b>           Don't go, Aibiee!
          Aibileen kneels down as Elizabeth returns with the syrup.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           Baby, you need to get back to bed.
           You got a fever.

<b>                          MAE MOBLEY
</b>           Noooo! Don't go, Aibee. Please
           don't leave.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           I gots to, Baby. I am so sorry.

<b>                          MAE MOBLEY
</b>           Why? Are you going to take care of
           another little girl?

<b>           137.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           No, Baby, that's not the reason. I
           don't want to leave you, but...It's
           time for me to retire. You my last
           little girl.

           ever thing I told you. Okay? Do
           you remember what I told you?

<b>                          MAE MOBLEY
</b>           To wipe my bottom good?

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           No, Baby. The other. What you
           are.

<b>                          MAE MOBLEY
</b>           You is kind. You is smart. You is
           important.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           That's right, Baby Girl.
          Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time. They both
          cry together. Hilly speaks up.

<b>                          HILLY
</b>           You need to go now, Aibileen!
          Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth.

<b>                          AIBILEEN
</b>           Give my sweet girl a chance.
          Elizabeth avoids eye contact. Aibileen turns and walks away.
          As Elizabeth leans down to pick up Mae Mobley....HER WATER
          BREAKS. She glares at Hilly with shock and regret.

                         

<b>          EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Aibileen steps out of the house with her purse.
          She walks stoically down the driveway. Tears stream down her
          face.
          Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying. She beats
          on the glass from inside.

<b>                          MAE MOBLEY
</b>           Aibeeeee! Don't go!

<b>           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
</b>           Mae Mobley was my last baby. In
           just thirty minutes, I felt like my
           whole life was done. Of the
           thirteen maids, seven of us got
           fired. Several other maids got
           fired who had nothin' to do with
           our book. Guess our stories
           weren't so unique after all...But,
           like Minny, we was all free.

          Hilly, even fatter now, sifts through the day's mail.

<b>           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
</b>           And we's was a lot freer than Hilly
           Holbrook.
          She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The
          Starving Children of Africa Fund. A smug smile forms.
          She opens the envelope to find a check for $200.00 made out
          to: TWO-SLICE HILLY!
          Hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces.

</b>           Ever so often, we all get a nice
           piece of book money in the mail.
           `Manna from heaven' we like to call
           it.
          Minny looks across the table and smiles at Celia who is
          holding and playing with Minny's newborn child.

          A bouquet of flowers lay at the foot of the tombstone. A
          copy of "The Help" leans against it.
          In the distance, a cab slowly pulls away with Skeeter inside.

          Aibileen sits at her kitchen table, typing on Skeeter's old
          typewriter. We watch as keys write out the rest of
          Aibileen's voice over.

<b>           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
</b>           Thousands of our books went out all

           tell the truth and we just couldn't
           believe it...
          Aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and
          places it behind two hundred other typed out pages.
          She looks up to the framed picture of Treelore and rises from
          the table with pride.

          Skeeter smiles as she reads from a book in her corner office.
          The Manhattan skyline rises behind her. She wears Pucci.
          Her hair is perfectly styled. She looks gorgeous.
          She sets the book down on her desk and picks up the phone.
          The book's cover reads:
           "All My Babies"
           By Aibileen Clark
          Next to the book is a glass box. Constantine's corn pipe
          rests inside.

                         

<b>          AIBILEEN'S NEW HOME - LIVING ROOM - FIFTEEN YEARS LATER

          glasses hang on a chain from around her neck.
          As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the
          surroundings of her new home for the first time. It's much
          bigger, well furnished and beautiful.
          She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of
          "The Help" and "All My Babies" are placed side by side.
          At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door
          of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom.
          She enters the bathroom and closes the door.
