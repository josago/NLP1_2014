of a video camera. The screwdriver blade of a Swiss Army
knife ENTERS FRAME, methodically tightening a row of
screws.

PULL BACK to reveal:


<b>EXT. BOMBARDED NEIGHBORHOOD (WAR-TORN COUNTRY) - DAY
</b>
On the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV
crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all
wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY
TAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam.

Throughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a
laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around
him.

HOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering
cautiously over the crest of the rubble through
binoculars.

Beyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with
buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the
f.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street,
billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.

<b>                         HOWARD
</b>           How about it, Jeff?

Jeff finishes his repair job, snaps the minicam closed.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>           Done.

Jeff slips the knife back in his pocket, scrambles over
the loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard.


<b>EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - DAY
</b>
A frightened woman lurks nervously in the shelter of the
wall. She is young, in her early twenties, with shining
dark hair down to her shoulders. She's carrying an
armload of books.


<b>EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE - DAY
</b>
Jeff focuses the minicam.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        2.
</b>
<b>MINICAM POV
</b>
FRAMED in the viewfinder we see the frightened woman.

<b>                           HOWARD (O.S.)
</b>          Nice legs.

Jeff ignores Howard, PANS the minicam DOWN the street.
In the viewfinder we see the flash of sun on metal.


<b>EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - DAY
</b>
A row of blasted windows. In one of the windows, a
sniper crouches. Sunlight glitters on his rifle barrel.


<b>EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
</b>
<b>                           JEFF
</b>                    (matter-of-fact)
          Sniper.

<b>                           HOWARD
</b>          Where?

<b>                       JEFF
</b>          High-rise. Top floor.        Window in
          the middle.

<b>                        HOWARD
</b>                 (looking through
                  his binoculars)
          Stay on him. Stay on him.        Now go
          back to the woman. Now!

Jeff swings the minicam and --


<b>EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - MINICAM POV
</b>
-- the image blurs, then holds steady on the frightened
woman. Nervously, she peeks around the corner.

<b>                        HOWARD (O.S.)
</b>          Back to the sniper.


<b>EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
</b>
<b>                        HOWARD
</b>          Stay tight on the sniper.
          Jesus -- look at him! He's about
          fourteen! Don't lose this!

Jeff kneels on the ridge, minicam on his shoulder.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      3.
</b>
<b>EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - POV THROUGH VIEWFINDER
</b>
Jeff's minicam ZOOMS IN ON the sniper. The sniper sees
the woman peeking and gets his rifle in firing position.

<b>                          JEFF
</b>          He sees her.


<b>EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
</b>
<b>                        HOWARD
</b>          Stay on her. If she runs, widen
          and try to get her and sniper in
          the same frame.

Jeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at
Howard.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          I said he sees her.

<b>                          HOWARD
</b>          I heard you.    Stay on her.

Jeff looks to Rod for support but he's busy typing,
oblivious.

Jeff hesitates, then lifts the minicam to his eye again.


<b>EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE
</b>
The sniper, taking aim.


<b>EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL
</b>
The frightened woman decides to make a dash for it.   She
takes off her high-heeled shoes, inhales deeply,
gathering herself to run.


<b>EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
</b>
Jeff watches through his viewfinder:

<b>                        JEFF
</b>                 (under his breath)
          No... no...


<b>EXT. STREET
</b>
The frightened woman bolts, sprinting barefoot across the
cobblestones, skirt lifted, slender legs flashing.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       4.
</b>
<b>EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE
</b>
Jeff jumps to his feet, waves the minicam, shouting:

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          Sniper!   Sniper! Sni--


<b>STREET
</b>
The woman looks up in Jeff's direction, confused,
breaking stride --

We hear a burst of automatic gunfire --


<b>RUINED HIGH-RISE
</b>
In the window, the winking muzzle-flash of the sniper's
<b>AK-47.
</b>

<b>STREET
</b>
The woman's body jolts from the impact of the bullets.
The books go flying from her hand. She spins to the
pavement, her hair billowing.


<b>JEFF
</b>
just stands there, a shattered expression. The camera
hangs at his side. He stares at the dead woman as a pool
of dark blood expands around her body.

<b>                                           CUT TO:

<b>EXT. LOGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (BOSTON) - RUNWAY -

A 747 touches down on the tarmac.

</b>

<b>EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - NIGHT
</b>
A late-model Jeep Cherokee is parked at the arrival curb.
AMY TAYLOR, Jeff's wife, peers out from behind the wheel,
scanning the crowd.


<b>HER POV
</b>
Jeff, carrying a single bag slung over his shoulder,
emerges from the terminal.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           5.
</b>
<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Amy gets out of the car, grinning. Jeff sees her and
hurries over. He drops his bag and they fall into each
other's arms, kissing hungrily. These are two people
passionately in love with each other.

<b>                        AMY
</b>          God, I missed you.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>          Me too.

<b>                        AMY
</b>          Let's get out of here. Where's
          your equipment? Don't tell me you
          checked it?

<b>                        JEFF
</b>                 (holds up his bag)
          This is it.

<b>                           AMY
</b>          No camera?

Jeff shakes his head no.

<b>                           AMY
</b>          No nothing?

Again Jeff shakes his head.       Amy arches an eyebrow.

<b>                           AMY
</b>          Ah ha.

<b>                                                CUT TO:
</b>

<b>INT. JEFF AND AMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
A modest apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood. Not
much furniture, but lots of books and CD's. On the
walls, blow-ups of arty photographs -- Amy in modeling
poses, plus many black-and-white scenery stills.

Jeff's bag is unopened on the floor. We see two nearly
full wine glasses on a table. The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN a
hallway TO the open bedroom door.


<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
More framed photographs.

Amy lies in bed, curled up against a pillow. The sheets
are tangled in post-coital disarray, the only sign of
disorder in this neatly arranged room.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         6.
</b>
<b>CLOSER
</b>
Amy stirs, reaching her hand out toward the other side of
the bed, which is empty. She opens her eyes, surprised
to find herself alone.

<b>                              AMY
</b>             Jeff?

No reply.

Something catches her attention from across the room.
She rises, pulls a loose robe around herself and pads
over to a closed door. She knocks softly.

<b>                              AMY
</b>             Can I come in?

<b>                              JEFF (O.S.)
</b>             Sure.


<b>INT. DARKROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A walk-in closet has been converted into a small
photographic darkroom. Moist 8 X 10 prints hang from a
clothesline, bathed in a warm red glow. The images are
moody black and white landscapes.

Jeff stands over the developer, timing a print. Amy
enters through a thick black curtain behind him. He
doesn't look up.

<b>                           AMY
</b>             Couldn't sleep?

Jeff shakes his head. Amy looks over his shoulder at a
landscape photograph in the developing tray.

<b>                           AMY
</b>             I remember when you took that. We
             had fun on that trip, didn't we?

Jeff nods.    Amy looks at him.     After a beat:

<b>                           AMY
</b>             You want to talk about it?

<b>                           JEFF
</b>             There's nothing to talk about.

<b>                            AMY
</b>             C'mon, Jeff.

<b>                                               (CONTINUED)

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                           JEFF
</b>             I told you. I quit.   Walked out.
             end of story.

<b>                            AMY
</b>             That's   it?

Jeff nods.

<b>                        AMY
</b>          Whatever happened back there
          wasn't your responsibility. You
          can't keep beating yourself up
          over it.

He says nothing.

<b>                        AMY
</b>          What do you think? You could have
          stopped that girl from getting
          killed?

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          You don't understand...

He stops, lifts his eyes.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          It was different this time.

He breaks off and pushes through the curtain.    She
watches him go.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff pours himself a glass of milk. Amy enters, stands
on the other side of the counter. Jeff doesn't meet her
eyes. After a beat:

<b>                       JEFF
</b>         I talked to Reynolds.
                (a beat)
         He thinks I could still get the
         job at the San Diego station.

<b>                       AMY
</b>         Oh, Jeff, you didn't...

<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                           8.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                           JEFF
</b>             Think of it. Low pressure, a
             steady paycheck. So I shoot city
             council meetings -- how bad could
             it be?

She looks at him, concerned.

<b>                           AMY
</b>             Is that what you really want -- or
             are you just running away?

<b>                       JEFF
</b>         Who's running? It's good money,
         full benefits. I'm tired of
         freelance. We could finally put
         some money in the bank.

<b>                       AMY
</b>         You know I'll never stand in your
         way. But you've worked so hard.
         Are you sure you want to throw it
         away?

<b>                       JEFF
</b>         Throw what away? Don't you get
         it? I don't do anything. I sit,
         I watch, I film -- I let it
         happen.

<b>                           AMY
</b>             You're supposed to let it happen.
             It's your job.

<b>                            JEFF
</b>             No, Amy.   It's my excuse.

She looks at him, not understanding.       He hesitates.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          That girl... it's like I was
          paralyzed. I wanted to do
          something, but I didn't. I just
          stood there and watched her get
          killed.

He looks at her, emotional.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>             Please, babe, I need this.     Say
             yes and we'll take as long    as you
             want -- drive cross-country    and
             make a vacation out of it.     What
             do you say?

<b>                                                 (CONTINUED)

Amy looks at him, considering. We hear a faint RUSH OF
WIND. Then it gets LOUDER... LOUDER... and --

<b>EXT. CREDIT MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - LOW ANGLE -
</b><b>DAY AND NIGHT
</b>
The metallic grill of the Cherokee explodes INTO FRAME as
the car whooshes over us, hurtling down the Massachusetts
Turnpike.

In a SERIES OF SHOTS, with CREDITS OVER, we see landmarks
form the cross-country trip: a Pennsylvania Dutch
farmhouse, a smoke-spewing factory in Ohio, the
Mississippi River, Kansas wheat fields, Loveland Pass and
the Continental Divide.

<b>                                              DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY
</b>
The middle of nowhere. Sand, weeds and sagebrush. A
two-lane highway stretches to the horizon like a ribbon
of asphalt.

The Cherokee cruises along the road. Its Massachusetts
plates seem out of place in this stark landscape.

There are no other vehicles.

MOVING CLOSER, we see that Jeff is driving.    Amy is sound
asleep in the reclined passenger seat.

In back, luggage, moving boxes, camera cases.


<b>INT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY
</b>
The AIR CONDITIONING WHISPERS. On the console are two
empty Styrofoam McDonald's coffee cups and a state-of-
the-art Nikon Camera.

Jeff stretches in the driver's seat. He forces his eyes
open, fighting sleep. He reaches for the coffee cup...
it's empty. He glances into the back of the Jeep. There
is a thermos of coffee on the back seat.

Keeping one hand on the wheel, he reaches for the thermos
and fumbles it to the floor. He strains to reach it. He
doesn't notice...
<b>
</b><b>                                                     10.
</b>
<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - 200 YARDS AHEAD
</b>
A slow-moving Dodge Ram pickup truck is approaching the
highway along a small road that cuts across the desert
floor.

The pickup, equipped with oversized tires, roll bar, and
a CB whip antenna, bounces over the uneven terrain and
turns onto the highway, stopping just before entering
Jeff's lane.


<b>INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
</b>
Jeff glances up just in time to see the Ram lurch into
the road in front of him. Jeff drops the thermos and
spins the wheel!

Amy's eyes fly open --


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
The Cherokee goes into a wild looping skid. The Ram
jerks to a halt as the Cherokee whips past, averting a
collision by inches.


<b>INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
</b>
Jeff expels a breath. Amy turns to see the pickup
stopped in the road. She looks at him, concerned.

<b>                           AMY
</b>          Jesus, Jeff...

<b>                           JEFF
</b>          Sorry.     I took my eyes off the
          road.

<b>                        AMY
</b>                 (seeing thermos
                  on floor)
          Maybe it's time we took a break,
          you know?

Jeff nods, looks in the rearview mirror.


<b>HIS POV - PICKUP
</b>
halted in the middle of the road. Inside, dimly-visible
through tinted windows, are two figures in cowboy hats.

The driver leans out the window and gives Jeff the
finger.

angry at himself.    He looks over at Amy.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          I'll pull over next chance we get.
                 (a beat)
          Sorry...

He glances in the rearview again, still a bit shaken.

<b>EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
</b>
A small desert gas station/mini-mart just off the
highway. A sign over the building: "Last Gas For 30
Miles." The Cherokee is parked at the pumps, hood
raised.

Jeff comes out of the mini-mart, carrying a   plastic quart
of oil. He unscrews the cap and starts to    fill the
crankcase, careful not to spill on the new   engine. In
the b.g., Amy is visible inside the store,   browsing a
magazine rack.


<b>INT. CONVENIENCE MART - SAME TIME
</b>
Amy thumbs through a cheap tourist guide, The Desert
Southwest. A TRUCK DRIVER stands nearby, perusing the
magazines. He glances in Amy's direction, notices what
she's reading.

<b>                          TRUCKER
</b>          On vacation?

Amy looks up at him. He's 50ish, plain-looking,
friendly, wearing a "U.S.A." logo baseball cap.

<b>                          AMY
</b>          Sort of.    We're moving, actually.

<b>                         TRUCKER
</b>          Whereabouts?

Amy hesitates. She's not used to talking with strangers,
but the guy seems harmless enough.

<b>                        AMY
</b>          California. We thought we'd take
          the scenic route.

<b>                         TRUCKER
</b>           Huh. In that case, you oughta try
           the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles
           west. Real pretty, makes a loop
           through the hills, then hooks back
           up with the highway.

Amy smiles politely, moves toward the cash register.

<b>                        AMY
</b>           Thanks. I'll mention it to my
           husband.

The Trucker tips his cap.

<b>                         TRUCKER
</b>           Okay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the
           rest of your trip.


<b>EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

As Jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the
mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps
behind him. The driver, EARL, climbs out. The other man
remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up.

Earl is a beefy man about Jeff's age. He wears a sweat-
stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the
sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He
saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat,
looking over Jeff's shoulder.

Jeff senses something behind him, turns. His eyes widen
as he sees Earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he
nearly hit a few minutes before. Earl stares at him,
unsmiling.

<b>                         EARL
</b>                  (flatly)
           Nice car.

Jeff is in an awkward position. He's got a half-full
upside-down bottle of oil in his hands. If he lifts it
now, he'll spill on the engine. He turns his gaze back
to the engine, decides to keep pouring.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>           Thanks.

Earl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in.
Jeff watches him, wary.

</b>             Then again, out here, what you
             really need's a C.B. radio.

<b>                              JEFF
</b>             Is that right?

The oil bottle empties    out. Relieved, Jeff pulls it away
and screws back on the    crankcase cap. He shuts the hood
with a thunk and moves    around to the side of the car to
remove the gas nozzle    from the tank. Earl blocks his
path.

<b>                           EARL
</b>             'Course, if you use a C.B., you
             gotta have a handle.

Jeff says nothing.      This is not a friendly conversation.

<b>                           EARL
</b>             How about Shit-for-Brains?
                    (beat)
             You damn near killed us back
             there, boy.

         You pulled out in front of me.

<b>                       EARL
</b>         The hell I did. I saw what
         happened.

Looking past Earl, Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini-
mart with a bag of groceries. He speaks carefully,
anxious to avoid a confrontation.

<b>                       JEFF

Earl glares at Jeff before turning away.    He passes Amy,
gives her a broad smile.

</b>             Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow
             tryin' to steal your Cherokee.

Amy takes in the situation. She nods politely. Earl
continues into the mini-mart. She approaches Jeff,
puzzled.

Jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who
has not moved during the scene. He looks back at the
mini-mart.

Jeff climbs in behind the wheel. Amy glances at him and
gets in the car. Jeff keys the IGNITION and pulls away.

Jeff shifts in his seat, relieved to be getting away from
there. Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75,
then 80, then 85.

</b>             This isn't the Grand Prix, you

Jeff releases his foot from the accelerator.     The needle
sinks back down to 65.

She gives him a long contemplative look.

                 (pause)
          The guy was an asshole.

Keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror, Jeff nods toward
the grocery bag, trying to change the subject.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          What'd you get?

Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food.

<b>                        AMY

The CAR bucks and SCREECHES. After a few HICCUPS, it
jerks to a halt, just beyond a crest in the road.

For a moment, they sit there dazed, staring ahead at the
empty road. Then Amy notices an object on the floor --
the Nikon. She picks it up.

Steam pours from under the    hood of the Cherokee. Amy
gets out and looks around    at the scorched wasteland.
Jeff goes to the front of    the car, gropes under the hood
for the release latch. He     yanks his hand away, burned by
the hot metal.

Jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine. He tugs on a
cable, checks the battery connection and radiator.

He goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand-held
cellular phone from the glove box. He dials zero and
hits "send." The PHONE BEEPS.

notices.

was last seen.

smile. He glances up at a small plane flying overhead.

             this    road, that's why the truckers
             use    it. Maybe you'll get lucky.
                       (tipping his cap)
             Good    luck.

He turns and heads back toward his truck. Amy looks at
Jeff. She waits till the trucker is out of earshot.

<b>                             AMY

          be hours before anyone else      comes
          along. It's 100 degrees.        You

Amy hears this.       She's had enough.   Flares.

</b>          Stupid is sitting out here waiting
          for a cop when we already have a

In the b.g., the TRUCK is THROTTLING UP.       Then, mad and
careless:

</b>             Stupid was letting you talk me
             into leaving Boston.

She turns away. The truck starts to pull out. She bites
her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the
truck down. Red brakes.

Jeff follows, lowering his voice.

She walks to the truck. Jeff stands there. She climbs
into the cab. Red moves some papers out of the way.

She pulls the door shut. The TRUCK THROTTLES UP and

distance, flashers blinking. After a beat, the flashers
cease.

the Cherokee, checking his watch, wiping beads of sweat
from his face. He looks down the highway.

Nothing in sight. Extremely bored, he wanders over to
the raised hood and studies the engine again.

After a few moments, something catches his eye. Curious,
he kneels down and peers under the chassis. He frowns.

He pulls his Swiss Army knife  from his pocket and slides
under the car. Working with   the screwdriver blade of the
knife, he reconnects the plug  to its socket. In the
process, his hands and shirt  become stained with grease.

Jeff slides out from under the car, brushes himself off
and gets behind the wheel. He tosses the Swiss Army
knife on the center console and keys the ignition. The
ENGINE ROARS to life.

A weather-beaten structure with a gravel parking lot.     A
peeling sign on the roof: "Belle's: Beer & Food."
There is a phone booth outside.

The Cherokee pulls in and parks.      Jeff CHIRPS the ALARM,
heads for the entrance.

</b>
Dark and dingy. Formica tables, a bar. Chunky customers
in K-Mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and
watching a football game on a big MUTED TV.

Jeff enters and all conversation stops. The other
patrons turn and stare. After a moment, they return to
their beers.

Jeff glances around.   No sign of Amy.   No sign of Red.

A bored-looking BARTENDER stands behind the counter,
preparing a sandwich. Behind him, a blackboard menu.
Jeff approaches.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          Excuse me.

The Bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          I was supposed to meet my wife
          here.

The Bartender shrugs, gives him a look:    Yeah, so?

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Dark hair, slender, about five-

The Bartender plops the sandwich on a plate, tears off an
order slip.

</b>          Hank!  Your order's ready.

</b>             Don't ring a bell.

<b>                           JEFF

The Bartender leans over the counter, calls out:

</b>             Hey! Man here's looking for his
             wife, dark hair, button-on shirt,
             travelin' with a guy in a baseball
             cap. Anybody see 'em?

Jeff looks up and down the counter. Blank faces, a few
disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no.

A disheveled female barfly, FLO, grins up at him.

</b>             Looks like she got away from ya,
             cowboy.

A few of the regulars chuckle at this.     Jeff ignores
them, turns back to the Bartender.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>             Could she have left a message with

Jeff scratches his head.    This doesn't make any sense.

<b>                        JEFF

          No siree. Definitely not.

Jeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around.      An
elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him.      They
whisper to each other.

He turns and goes outside...

Jeff squints in the bright sunlight.

Maybe he got this place confused with a different diner.
He peers up at the sign. It says "Belle's," all right.

He walks to the phone booth, looks inside.   The phone
book is missing.

He picks up the receiver, listens for the dial tone...
Phone works okay. He hangs up.

He stands there for a moment, scanning the horizon in all
directions. There is nothing else out here, nowhere else
she could have gone.

Jeff marches back into the diner...

Either the driver doesn't notice, or he's ignoring Jeff,
but the truck does not slow down.

Jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside
the cab. He HONKS again and waves, gesturing for the
truck to pull over. But the Peterbilt maintains its
speed.

Jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver...


<b>POV SHOT

It's Red, alright. But he's wearing a different cap.

waves:

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          I don't know what the hell's going
          on. Last time I saw her she was
          with this guy in his truck. Now

The Sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster...
just a precaution.

                 (to Jeff)
          Sir, you want to tell me what
          happened?

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Our car broke down. This guy
          stopped to help us, said he'd
          drive my wife to a pay phone.    But
          she never showed up.

          runs me off the road and starts
          hollering about his wife. I
          swear, I never seen the guy
          before.

<b>                        SHERIFF BOYD

The Sheriff takes a long look at both of them, unsure
what to think. He turns back to Red.

<b>                        SHERIFF BOYD
</b>          Sir, all right with you if I
          search your truck?

          ahead. Name's Red, by the way.
          Red Barr.
                 (pulls out his
                  wallet)

          of you.

As Red closes his wallet, several credit cards fall to
the ground. He bends to scoop them up. Jeff eyes this
suspiciously.

The Sheriff climbs up into the truck.


<b>INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY
</b>
The Sheriff pokes his head inside, looks around.

Pretty much what you'd expect in a long-haul big rig:
a CB radio, a plastic Jesus, a map of the U.S. taped to
the ceiling with hundreds of magic marker X's showing
where the truck has been.

The Sheriff looks into the sleeping area behind. A
blanket is folded over a foam mattress. A stained pillow
rests on top.

Jeff and Red keep a careful eye on each other as the
Sheriff climbs down from the cab, wiping his hands.

</b>                (to both of them)
         All right, let's see your license
         and registration.

Jeff and Red fish into their wallets and hand over
I.D.'s. The Sheriff examines them, comparing faces to
pictures and writing down names.

<b>                       SHERIFF BOYD

<b>EXT. REAR OF PETERBILT - DAY
</b>
Jeff and the Sheriff observe as Red unlatches two heavy
padlocks. Grunting, he raises the slatted METAL DOOR.
It retracts along the ceiling with a noisy RATTLE.


<b>INSIDE
</b>
The cavernous interior is mostly empty, except for a few
randomly strewn cardboard boxes, too small to contain a
person.

The Sheriff considers it, shakes his head.

<b>                       SHERIFF BOYD
</b>          No. I think we're pretty much
          done here. You're free to go.

          There's no evidence of suspicious
          activity, no sign of struggle.

Red has been looking on.   He chimes in, trying to be
helpful:

             John Doe truck. Maybe you did get
             them mixed up.

Jeff stares at the Sheriff a beat, then bolts suddenly
for the front of the truck. He yanks open the door and
leaps up into the cab.

<b>                           SHERIFF BOYD
</b>             Hey!

The Sheriff jogs after him.      Red walks to the cab,
unconcerned.


<b>INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY

Jeff searches the cab for signs of Amy. He tosses aside
a jacket, rifles papers on the floor. There is nothing.

Sheriff Boyd looks up sternly as Jeff continues searching
the cab. Red watches calmly.

<b>                        SHERIFF BOYD
</b>          Mr. Taylor, either you come down
          from there or I'm going to have to
          arrest you.

Jeff gives up reluctantly. He looks lame and desperate
and he knows it. He steps down from the cab, gritting
his teeth.

<b>                          JEFF

Jeff stares at him, knows where this is going.

Red climbs into the cab. Jeff watches helplessly,
resigned to the fact there's nothing more he can do.        The
Sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio.        As
the truck drives off, Jeff goes over to the cruiser.

<b>                        SHERIFF BOYD

          into, maybe you had a fight -- you
          don't have to tell me. The point
          is I'm trying to help.

He hands Jeff a card with an address printed on it.

<b>                        SHERIFF BOYD
</b>          The town of Brackett's 31 miles

          Carver. He's a good man. He'll
          help you fill out the necessary
          forms if you want to report your
          wife missing.

Jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in.    The Sheriff
softens, his tone sympathetic.

<b>                        SHERIFF BOYD
</b>          If you want my opinion, your wife

          plenty pissed off and giving you a

It's a creepy feeling. Several yards away, DEPUTY LEN

filling out a form. Jeff looks shaken.

<b>                        DEPUTY CARVER

Jeff looks around, not particularly trusting the
Bartender's skills of observation. He grinds his jaw.

The other customers at the bar have been watching all

Jeff.

The Barfly gives Jeff a wink and turns back to his beer.
Snickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes
when Jeff glances at them. Jeff knows this is almost
certainly a put-on, but he can't take a chance.

While the Barflies watch, poker-faced, Jeff walks to the
door of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks. His
knock is answered by a wordless sound, HALF-GROAN, HALF-
<b>GASP.
</b>
<b>                          JEFF
</b>          Amy?

Silence. Jeff tries the door. It's locked. He rattles
it. Another GROAN. Jeff puts his shoulder against the
door, heaves inward. The door swings open, revealing --
<b>
</b><b>                                                       42.

<b>INSIDE BATHROOM
</b>
Flo, bent over the toilet, vomiting. She whirls around,
a strand of spittle dangling from her lip.

<b>                        FLO
</b>          Hey -- what the hell you doing?!

Jeff backs away, yanks the door shut.   The barflies
chuckle among themselves.

Jeff strides angrily for the exit. He stops at the door,
takes one last look around. No one seems to be paying
him much attention. He turns to leave...

... but something stops him. He can't put his finger on
it. There's something wrong here...

He stares at the other customers. Why do they avoid eye
contact? Are they hiding something?

He scrutinizes more closely...

There is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table
shoveling food in his mouth. He's been averting his gaze
ever since Jeff walked in.

And then there's the traveling salesman. Overweight,
sweaty. Popping vitamins along with his coffee.

Or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book
at the bar? Probably an ex-con.

While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind,
a trucker approaches the counter to place an order. The
Bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the
carbon slip. He places one copy above the grill and
another in a pile by the cash register.

Jeff stares, an idea forming...

He approaches the bar.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          I want to see your order slips.

<b>                         BARTENDER
</b>          What?

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          You write down the names.   I want
          to see them.

<b>                       BARTENDER
</b>         What are you, nuts? I don't have
         to show you jack shit.

Jeff leans in his face.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>             If my wife came in here, then her
             name's in that pile.

The Bartender stiffens, stares him straight in the eye:

<b>                        BARTENDER
</b>          You calling me a liar?

A tense beat.

Possessed by a sudden impulse, Jeff makes a grab for the
receipts. Before he can reach them, the Bartender's hand
clamps onto his.

<b>                        BARTENDER
</b>          Mister, I've had just about enough
          of you.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Let me see the fucking slips.

In one swift motion, Jeff overpowers the man and extracts
the receipts. He starts going through them, fast,
looking at names. TULLY, MARK, FLO, ANDY and...

Jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a
Smith & Wesson revolver.

<b>                        BARTENDER
</b>          Now, mister, you're going to have
          to leave.

Jeff takes a step back. Everyone in the diner is
staring. He stumbles backwards, heads for the exit.


<b>EXT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY
</b>
Jeff exits, breathing hard, and runs to the phone booth.


<b>PHONE BOOTH
</b>
is occupied by a YOUNG MAN with an awkward oversized
frame, ill-fitting clothes. Jeff raps on the glass
anxiously.

<b>                        JEFF

The Man looks up, dull and glassy-eyed. His sluggish
demeanor suggests mental retardation. He hangs up and
slowly opens the door.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          How'd you know? Did you see her?

The Sluggish Man hesitates. There's something holding
him back. Jeff senses this.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Please, if you know something,
          anything, tell me.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>          What?    When?

Billy is about to answer. In b.g., the Bartender sticks
his head out of the diner. Billy backs away, spooked.

<b>                       BILLY
</b>          Oh man. Never shoulda opened my
          damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it.

Billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot.
Jeff hurries after him and catches up, cornering Billy
between two cars, trying to calm him.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          No one's going to hurt you, Billy.
          Just tell me what you saw.

Billy glances around nervously, swallowing.

<b>                        BILLY
</b>          She came in on a truck.   A big
          white one.

<b>                        BILLY

Jeff reels, struggles to stay focused.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Do you know where they went?

<b>                          BILLY
</b>          Uh-huh.    Route seven.   Up by the
          river.

<b>                        JEFF

<b>                         BILLY

</b>          Who doesn't? The bartender?      The
          men in the truck?

Billy's expression darkens.     He starts backing away.

<b>                        BILLY
</b>          I ain't talking to you no more.

<b>                        JEFF

          saw, they'll be able to help me.

Billy laughs.

<b>                        BILLY
</b>          Man, you're the dummy.

Jeff looks at him, confused.

<b>                        BILLY
</b>          Don't you git it? The police is
          the ones in on it!

<b>INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

Jeff drives flat-out, his face grim.    The speedometer
reads 100 mph.

Keeping his eye on the road, he thumbs through the pages
of a pocket address book. He picks up the handheld
cellular phone and dials.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          C'mon... work, goddammit...

The "NO SERVICE" INDICATOR BEEPS.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Fuck.


<b>EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY
</b>
The highway intersects Route 7. The Cherokee slows just
enough to take the corner without tipping over.

It flies past a sign:   "Route 7 - North."

<b>EXT. ROUTE 7 - DAY

The road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert
plain. The route is narrow and windy, forcing Jeff to
reduce his speed.


<b>INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

Jeff drives, desperately searching for any sign of a
truck. There are no other vehicles on the road.

He keeps pressing the "REDIAL" button.    The "NO SERVICE"
INDICATOR BEEPS over and over.


<b>EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
The road curves through a tunnel, then climbs higher,
past sharp cliffs and drop-offs. Jeff follows the signs
for "Route 7."


<b>INT. CHEROKEE - DAY
</b>
Something catches Jeff's eye on the cell phone. For the
first time, the "SERVICE" indicator blinks green. Jeff
immediately grabs the phone again and presses "REDIAL."

dash, furious.

He punches redial, gets the "NO SERVICE" BEEPING, then
glances up, sees a --


<b>CHAINLINK FENCE
</b>
covered with high-visibility markers stretched across the
road. The sign: "ROAD CLOSED."


<b>BACK TO JEFF
</b>
He mashes the brakes. The CHEROKEE SKIDS to a halt just
short of the fence. Jeff stares at it.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>             Shit!

He grinds his teeth. Beyond the padlocked gate, the
highway continues as an unpaved dirt road.

He deliberates, then throws the Cherokee in reverse and
does a three-point turn so he's facing back in the
opposite direction.

He looks up, sees --


<b>DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCK
</b>
has been hiding in the bushes off the road. It lurches
forward and stops in the middle of the road, blocking
Jeff's escape. Jeff's eyes widen in fear as he
recognizes the vehicle and its driver: Earl.

Earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle.   He raises
it to his shoulder.

<b>                         EARL
</b>                  (calling out)
           Out of the car! Put your hands
           where I can see 'em!


<b>JEFF
</b>
swears, panicking.

<b>                         EARL
</b>           I said get out, dammit!   Now!

Jeff stares into the rifle, deliberating.   His hand moves
to the gearshift.

He jerks it into reverse and floors the gas!


<b>CHEROKEE
</b>
peels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming
for the chainlink fence.

It BURSTS the FENCE!   Poles and chain mesh go flying!


<b>JEFF
</b>
cranks the wheel and brakes hard. The rear end of the
Cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road.

He throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        49.

<b>EARL
</b>
jumps in the Ram and takes off in pursuit.


<b>JEFF
</b>
GUNS the ENGINE. The Cherokee bounces wildly on the
rutted, storm-damaged road. He yanks the four-wheel-
drive lever.


<b>DIRT ROAD
</b>
The huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee, its 7.5-LITER
V10 ROARING, oversized tires devouring the terrain.


<b>JEFF
</b>
GUNS the ENGINE on the washboard road surface, the
vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while --


<b>RAM
</b>
keeps pace in the dust from its wake. Inside the cab,
Earl can be seen speaking on a CB transmitter.


<b>JEFF
</b>
throws the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road. As
the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as --


<b>IDLED BULLDOZER
</b>
blocks the road at a construction site. More unattended
earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond.


<b>JEFF
</b>
brakes wildly. To his right, a cliff goes straight up;
on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine.

He cuts the wheel left, CRASHES through the GUARDRAIL and
plunges into the ravine!


<b>CHEROKEE
</b>
bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope, CRASHING
through sagebrush and manzanita.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        50.
</b>
<b>JEFF
</b>
clings to the wheel, tossed about violently, as suitcases
and packing boxes go everywhere.

The Cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and CRASHES
through the upper branches of a willow grove.

As the leaves part, we see... a river.


<b>CHEROKEE
</b>
lands on the passenger side with a SPLASH and comes to
rest half-submerged in the RUSHING WATER.


<b>EARL
</b>
jerks the Ram to a halt, leaps out and runs to the edge
of the road to look down on the Cherokee in the river.

<b>                             EARL
</b>            Sonofabitch...

He grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the
slope.


<b>INSIDE CHEROKEE
</b>
The world is sideways. Water rushes into the car. Jeff
is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt. The
AIRBAG DEFLATES with a HISS.

Jeff grimaces in pain. He looks around, blinking.   The
river is flowing right through the Cherokee!

Luggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke
cans bob on the surface of the water.

Jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release. The belt comes
free and he drops suddenly into the water on the
passenger side.

He gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the
driver's side door and pushes it open.

He hoists himself through the door.


<b>RIVERBANK
</b>
Earl sees Jeff emerging from the half-submerged Cherokee,
levels the RIFLE and FIRES!
<b>
</b><b>                                                      51.
</b>
<b>JEFF
</b>
ducks back inside the Cherokee, freaking.

The passenger side is on the river-bottom and if he tries
to get out through the driver's side, he's a sitting
duck!

Jeff swears and looks around, seeing a metal camera case
underwater in the back seat.

He grabs the case and swings it at the windshield.   The
first three blows bounce off harmlessly.

Then the WINDSHIELD SHATTERS with a CRASH!

He takes a deep breath, submerges and swims underwater
through the broken windshield.


<b>ON BANK
</b>
Earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water. Several
items of debris from the car are floating on the current.

<b>                            EARL
</b>             Fuck!

He begins moving downstream along the bank, eyeing the
river.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
Jeff breaststrokes for all he's worth. Sand swirls in
the swift current. He pushes away from a boulder in his
path.

He swims until his lungs are bursting, then surfaces for
air.


<b>ON BANK
</b>
Earl sees Jeff break the surface. He aims the RIFLE and
FIRES! A BULLET SMACKS the WATER near Jeff's head.

Then Jeff is under again.

<b>                            EARL
</b>             Goddammit...


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
Jeff struggles to stay in control. The current is
turning swifter. His shoulder glances painfully off a
boulder.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        52.
</b>
<b>ON BANK
</b>
Earl works his way through the brush at the river's edge.
His foot lands between two rocks. He pulls it out,
swearing.


<b>BEHIND ROCK
</b>
Jeff surfaces and gulps in air, staying out of sight of
Earl on the bank. Then he is down again.


<b>ON BANK
</b>
Earl works his way along the shore. Up ahead, the river
runs over rapids before passing around a bend.

Earl hears an ENGINE and turns. A huge moving van has
arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine.

He shouts to the DRIVER, pointing downriver.

<b>                          EARL
</b>            He's getting away!

The Driver shouts something inaudible. Earl runs along
the bank, ducking under low-hanging branches.


<b>IN RAPIDS
</b>
Jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast-moving
current. He slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and
swallowing a mouthful of water.

A downed tree hangs over the river. Jeff grabs
desperately and takes hold of a branch. He's got it!

Hanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object
floating past in the water: the "90,000 Donuts" pack.

Jeff tries to haul himself from the river. The BRANCH
bends under his weight. Then it comes free with a CRACK!

Jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water.


<b>ON BANK
</b>
Earl works his way along the shore.    The unseen Driver of
the van shouts to him from upriver.

<b>                           DRIVER OF VAN (O.S.)

<b>BELOW RAPIDS
</b>
The river has turned slow again.

Jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to
the bank. He drops to his knees, retching.

Clutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver.
For the moment, there is no sign of Earl. But he could
appear anytime.

Jeff gets to his feet, wincing. He looks up at the rocky
canyon wall bordering the river. It's steep but
scalable.

He begins climbing.

<b>EXT. ROCK OUTCROPPING - MINUTES LATER
</b>
Jeff has climbed to higher ground. He lies flat on his
belly and peers THROUGH a gap in the rocks at the river
valley below.


<b>JEFF'S POV - RIVER
</b>
The men have given up their pursuit.

The moving van, a jumbo three-axle GMC, has turned around
and backed up to the edge of the ravine.

A stocky man, AL (whom we recognize as Earl's passenger
at the minimart), operates a gas-powered winch in the
cargo door of the van.

A cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the
river.

Standing knee-deep in the current, Earl signals to Al
while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels,
then backwards out of the river.

watching in amazement.   He can hear only snatches of
their conversation.

<b>                        AL

<b>                        AL
</b>          Fuck... this is what happens when
          you get one without the other...

Jeff can't believe it. The Cherokee is being pulled
backwards up the slope toward the road.

He belly-crawls back from the outcropping, gets to his
feet and climbs higher.

Jeff has moved to higher ground. He crouches behind a
stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below.


<b>JEFF'S POV - ROAD
</b>
The Cherokee is now back on the road.

Operating the winch with precision efficiency, Earl and
Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the
moving van.

Once the vehicle is aboard, they stow the ramp and close
the van doors.


<b>BACK TO JEFF
</b>
watching in amazement, straining to hear what Earl and Al
are saying. Behind Jeff, a PEBBLE SKITTERS on the rock.

He turns, reacts.

It's Billy -- the halfwit from the diner! Wielding a
shotgun like a club, he swings the butt at Jeff's skull!

Jeff drops to the ground, unconscious.

<b>INT. CAR TRUNK - DAY
</b>
There is a CREAK as the TRUNK opens. Jeff lies inside,
dazed and disoriented, blinking into the sun. His eyes
won't focus. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk in
silhouette. He can hear their voices:

<b>                         EARL
</b>           He coming around?

<b>                         BILLY
</b>           Should be... I clocked him pretty

A gun barrel jabs Jeff in the ribs.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>           Rise and shine, dad.

Jeff blinks. A face slowly comes INTO FOCUS. Is it
really Billy? The halfwit from the diner? Only he isn't
a halfwit anymore.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>           C'mon, shake a leg.

Jeff looks at Billy. Nothing makes sense anymore. But
one thing is clear: Billy's mental retardation was all
an act.

It's nearly pitch black. A beam of sunlight shines
through a rusted hole. It illuminates Jeff's eyes.

The car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert.
Jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain.

He braces against the confines of the trunk. The ENGINE

Jeff gets out, grimacing.     His clothes are stained with
grease and tire grime. He     sets his feet unsteadily on
the ground, looks around.     We see that he has been
confined in the trunk of a    Pontiac Firebird.

The Firebird and Dodge Ram are parked on a bluff. Red
stands on the highest point, peering through binoculars
at the desert below. He glances at Jeff.

into his kidney. Jeff gasps in pain.

Red nods impassively.

Earl and Billy hoist Jeff to his feet and propel him up

From here, Jeff can see a small desert town spread out
below, as well as the highway leading through it. Red
gestures.

<b>                           RED

The IMAGE SHIFTS, then STEADIES and FOCUSES ON a small
building with a police cruiser out front and a barely
legible sign: "BRACKETT SHERIFF." It's the police
station where Jeff filed the missing persons' form
earlier.

<b>                        RED (O.S.)

          minute ago one of my men called in
          a non-injury accident on the I-40
          connector.

Deputy Carver comes out of the building gulping down a
sandwich. He gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights
flashing.

Jeff pushes through the main doors. It's a typical small
town operation. A guard stands near the entrance.
Several customers wait in line for the woman teller.

Jeff looks at the slow-moving line and swears softly. He

older man sitting at a desk in the rear of the bank, the
nameplate on the desk identifying him as Roger Calhoun.
Jeff approaches.

stands behind him.

<b>INT. BANK REST ROOM - DAY
</b>
Jeff enters and locks the door.

He startles at his reflection in the mirror.     He is
sunburned, dirty, lacerated.

He opens a cabinet and rifles through the supplies,
looking for anything that could be used as a weapon.     He
tosses aside detergents and air fresheners.

He picks up   the toilet plunger, pulls the wooden rod from
the rubber   base. He swings it into his palm a few times,
testing it   as a club. It's too bulky. He won't be able
to conceal   it.

He checks his watch. Time is running out.      He takes one
last look around the bathroom, then exits.

<b>INT. BANK - DAY
</b>
Jeff comes out of the rest room. The manager is behind
the teller's counter. The cowboy is gone. In his place
sits a middle-aged blue collar worker. He looks at Jeff.

Jeff takes a seat, glances at Calhoun's empty desk.
There is a letter opener on the desk, several paper bands
for wrapping currency.

Positioning his body so no one can see, Jeff takes the
letter opener and slips it into his sleeve. He scoops up
a handful of currency wrappers.

Jeff goes to the teller's window, scribbles something on
the back of a deposit slip and hands it to the teller.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Would you tell the manager I want
          the money in these denominations?

The teller looks at him oddly.

Jeff comes out of the bank with a manila envelope,
glancing up and down the street. There's no sign of the
men. He squints toward the mesa. No sign of them there
either.

He stands there. What's he supposed to do now? He
checks his watch, growing anxious. Finally he is about
to jog back in the direction he came, when... a PHONE
<b>RINGS.
</b>
Jeff turns. There's a pay PHONE down the street. It
RINGS again. He approaches quickly, lifts the receiver.

Jeff looks up and down the street, trying to figure out
where they're watching from. He looks toward the bank,
glimpses the manager peering through the window.

Jeff walks along the road, carrying the envelope.
Various cars pass in either direction, but none slow
down.

Jeff stiffens as an 18-wheeler approaches. But the TRUCK
THUNDERS past, blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his
face.

Jeff continues walking, anxiously checking over his
shoulder every few moments. His eyes narrow.

The Dodge Ram pickup is cruising toward him. It slows,
then brakes to a halt. The passenger door opens. Earl
sits behind the wheel, aiming an automatic pistol.

<b>                        EARL

Jeff stands firm.

             is.

</b>          Wrong, asshole. First you give me
          the money, then you find out.
          Unless you want me to shoot you
          dead right here on the highway.

Jeff looks around, wonders if Earl would risk shooting
him in view of passing traffic.

Jeff hesitates, then tosses the envelope on the      seat.
Earl opens it, reaches in and pulls out several      packets
of currency. They are wrapped with paper bands       and
appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds. He       replaces
them and gestures at Jeff with the gun.

<b>                        EARL
</b>          Now lift your shirt and jacket and
          turn around.

Jeff complies. Earl sees that he isn't carrying a gun.
He beckons Jeff toward the truck with the automatic.

<b>                        EARL
</b>          Turn around, hands behind your
          back, and step toward the truck.

Jeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side
door. Earl grabs his arms, yanks roughly and wraps them
with several layers of duct tape.

<b>                        EARL
</b>          Now get up in the truck, knees on

Jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the
floor, facing the rear of the pickup, his belly pressed
against the seat.

Earl reaches over and pulls the door shut. He throws the
truck in gear and starts driving. Jeff grimaces, looking
up at him.

<b>                        JEFF

Earl backhands Jeff against the passenger door. There is
a RINGING sound and Earl pulls a CELL PHONE from his
pocket. He presses a button and raises it to his face.

<b>                         EARL

                  (a beat;
                   listening)
          Gotcha.

He ends the call and tosses the cell phone on the dash.

<b>                        EARL
</b>          You gotta be the dumbest
          motherfuck yet. You think we

          car, Massachusetts plates --

          the bumper sticker that goes with
          it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for

He tucks the pistol in his belt.   Jeff looks at him,
seething.

Jeff tries to squirm free. Earl sees it and belts him
across the temple. Jeff slams into the passenger door,
wincing.

<b>                        EARL

                  driver)
          Help, help, I ain't got no power!

Earl laughs. Jeff has come to rest with his back against
the door. By contorting his arms, he is able to draw the
letter opener from his pocket.

He manipulates the letter opener into position and begins
cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists.

         I'll give you a hint. Only one
         thing smells better than money.
         You wanta guess what?

Earl laughs obscenely. He riffles the bills under his
nose again, then stops abruptly, frowning. He looks down
at the bills.

<b>                          EARL

Earl stares at the bills. Jeff works feverishly behind

examining the bills.

effectively hog-tied.

He then slams Earl back in the seat, circles his neck
twice with tape and wraps the free end around the base of
the passenger side headrest. Earl begins to gasp for
air.

Jeff pitches the gun away and it skitters down an
embankment. He raises his hands.

<b>INT. PICKUP - DAY
</b>
Earl struggles for breath. The duct tape is still tight
around his neck. He strains against the tape binding his
limbs.

He glances in the side view mirror to see the Sheriff
ordering Jeff down on the ground.

By wriggling and contorting his wrists, Earl is able to
tear one hand free. Then he pulls away the rest of the
duct tape from his knees.

The tape is still wrapped tightly around    his neck,
pinning him to the backrest. Earl claws     at the tape, but
it won't come free. Finally, with both     hands, he reaches
behind his head and yanks the read rest    from the seat.

He reaches into his boot for something...


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
Jeff is spread-eagled on the ground. Sheriff Boyd calls
out to Earl in the cab. He keeps his gun leveled.

<b>                        SHERIFF BOYD
</b>          You there -- in the pickup! You
          all right? Can you get out?

          Shut up.
                 (to Earl)
          C'mon out, sir. It's safe --

Earl sets one foot on the road. The headrest dangles
against his back, still taped to his neck. Suddenly Earl
whirls, holding a .22 snub-nose REVOLVER and FIRES!

The sheriff stumbles away, blood spurting from his
shoulder, the gun flying from his hand.

Jeff looks up in horror as the sheriff falls.

Earl comes around the pickup after Jeff, raising the gun
to fire. Jeff scrambles to his feet and dives down the
embankment.

Earl runs to the edge of the embankment. Down below,
Jeff is reaching for the automatic pistol the sheriff
ordered him to drop.

He finds it... too late...

Earl is aiming at point-blank range from the top of the
embankment. He is already squeezing the trigger when...

BLAM! Earl's chest erupts outward as a bullet passes
through his body from behind!

Earl staggers and flops down the embankment. He comes to
rest near Jeff, blood gurgling from a massive chest
wound.

Jeff climbs the embankment. The sheriff is lying on the
road, critically injured, gun lying nearby and still
smoking from the shot that killed Earl.

The sheriff is struggling to speak into a remote
transmitter strapped to his uniform.

</b>          Help is on the way, Sheriff. Just
          hang on. I have units and an
          ambulance en route.

Jeff bends over the Sheriff and examines his wound with a
grimace. He is verging on unconsciousness. Jeff
deliberates, torn. There is nothing he can do here.

Making up his mind, Jeff runs to the pickup. The hand-
held cellular phone has spilled into the road. He scoops
it up, jumps behind the wheel and LAYS RUBBER.

<b>EXT. BLUFF - DAY
</b>
Jeff stands on a ridge overlooking a Texaco truck stop.
Behind him, the Dodge Ram pickup lies hidden in a growth
of scrub oak and tumbleweeds.

Jeff looks overwhelmed by what he sees spread out below.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         77.
</b>
<b>JEFF'S POV - TEXACO TRUCK STOP
</b>
It's a giant truck stop. There are hundreds of big rigs
parked in rows like silvery sardines.

A sign towers over the main building:    "DIESEL $.99 GAL."


<b>BACK TO JEFF
</b>
He looks shaken. How will he ever find Red here?    It
seems impossible.

He descends the bluff to the truck stop.


<b>EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
</b>
Jeff skids on his heels down the loose hillside and
reaches the edge of the parking lot. There are trucks
everywhere. Diesel MOTORS RUMBLE. Exhaust fills the
air.

He reaches the end of a row of big rigs, starts searching
the grounds for the markings of Red's 18-wheeler.

It's nowhere in sight.

A high-pitched FEMININE SQUEAL from an adjacent truck's
sleeping compartment startles Jeff.

<b>                        TRUCKER (O.S.)
</b>                 (muffled)
          C'mon, baby, give it up!

The woman GIGGLES, O.S. Jeff ignores it, scanning the
truck stop. He stiffens.

A police car is arriving at the truck stop.

Staying out of sight, Jeff passes quickly to the rear of
a tractor trailer.


<b>EXT. TRUCK WASH - DAY
</b>
Jeff peers out from behind a parked mini-van as trucks
emerge wet and dripping from an immense truck wash.

Across the way, trucks are filling up on diesel at the
gas islands. Jeff's eyes narrow. Is that Red's
Peterbilt among them?

He quickens his pace, then falls back, slumping. The
rig's black driver is getting in the cab. Jeff glances
to the side, frowns.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
An older vacationing couple is eyeing Jeff warily.

Jeff looks down, cops to it instantly. His clothes are
ripped, caked with blood. He ducks between two parked
cars, using a side-view mirror as he hastily wipes blood
off his face. He checks to be sure no one is watching.

Something catches his eye.


<b>EXT. BLUFF - JEFF'S POV
</b>
A highway patrol car with flashing lights is parked near
the place where Jeff ditched the pickup. Beside it, a
state trooper surveys the truck stop with binoculars.


<b>EXT. TRUCK WASH - DAY
</b>
Jeff's jaw tightens. He glances toward the road, sees
two more highway patrol cars cruising the perimeter of
the truck stop.

Swearing, Jeff turns on his heels and walks away in the
opposite direction, shielding his face.


<b>EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
Jeff emerges from between two vehicles, glancing over his
shoulder nervously. He keeps his head down, moving fast.

He scans the truck stop in all directions. The patrol
car is still parked on the ridge, the patrolman peering
through binoculars.

Jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building,
passing a row of pay phones. He looks up, stops dead.

Red is talking on a pay phone six feet away.

Jeff stares. Red is facing away, unaware of his
presence. Jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone.

He shields his face with the receiver and listens.

         I don't know, dammit, he was

Red waits, listens.

          Stay off the airwaves. Bring the
          girl and meet me at the barn...
          You got that?

He hangs up.   Jeff presses the phone against his face and
turns away.

When he looks up, Red is walking toward his Peterbilt
truck, parked in a row of big rigs. Jeff starts to
follow, then freezes.

Several cops are fanning out on foot, questioning
everyone they encounter.

Jeff sees Red getting into his truck. The ENGINE KICKS
OVER. The BRAKES HISS and the truck begins pulling out.

Jeff whips around. The older vacationing couple are
talking to a cop fifty yards away. The husband points
toward the pay phones.

Jeff makes a sudden decision, doubles back behind a
rolling farm truck.


<b>COP
</b>
thanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow
officers.


<b>JEFF
</b>
runs alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield. He
overtakes the truck, cuts across its path. The farmer
BLARES his HORN.

Jeff glances left. Red's tractor trailer is traveling
across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed.
Jeff sprints in front of a moving car.

The driver jerks to a halt and HONKS, catching the
attention of a nearby cop. Jeff quickly turns away,
avoiding being seen.

Red's 18-wheeler turns toward the access road. Jeff
looks around, panicked. More cops are spreading out on
foot. They'll notice him any second.

Jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving
postal truck. The truck speeds up, nearly crushing him
under the rear wheel assembly.

Jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to
his feet on the other side and finds himself...

... in the path of another huge truck!

A cop is standing only 20 feet away! Jeff goes
underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving
wheels. He springs to his feet.

Red's Peterbilt is pulling away!

Jeff runs for all he's worth. His arms and legs pump
furiously. He runs abreast of the truck...

... and seizes the spare tire mount!


<b>EXT. INTERSTATE - UNDER TRUCK - DAY
</b>
Jeff hangs on for dear life. His legs drag over the
asphalt. He lets out a cry of pain.

The truck is joining the highway, accelerating.

Grimacing, Jeff swings his legs over the universal joint
as the roadway races past below. The huge TIRES are a
HOWLING blur.

Suddenly his grip falters on the grease. His back
scrapes the rushing asphalt. Jeff gasps, makes a grab
and holds firm.

As he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt
in the passing lane. A three-year-old boy sits in the
rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled
expression on his face.

Jeff stares back. It's an odd moment between the two.
The station wagon continues forward and EXITS FRAME.

<b>EXT. UNDER TRUCK - DAY
</b>
The tires kick up a hail storm of loose gravel and dirt,
pelting Jeff all over his body.

He realizes he can't stay where he is. Grunting with
effort, he works his way hand over hand along the
underside rigging toward the cab.

He seizes the trailer hitch and hoists himself up.


<b>EXT. BETWEEN CAB AND TRAILER - DAY
</b>
Standing on the coupler, Jeff clutches his ribs and
catches his breath. He's in pain. The road whips by
below his feet.

The truck hits an uneven stretch of road and bounces
violently. Jeff grabs the coiled brake line for support.

The truck is doing 70 mph, exhaust racketing.

Jeff pulls the cell phone from his pocket and dials 911.
He holds it tightly to his ear, shouting above the wind.

Behind the two-story farm house, a rusted Volkswagen bus

Red kills the engine and climbs out of the cab. As he
walks toward the house, a screen DOOR SLAPS. DEKE, 9,
squirts across the lawn in his pajamas.

Deke takes the key and sprints for the barn while Red

</b>             I told you we shoulda gotten rid
             of 'em like that couple up in

             what? We stay out of the area for
             a while, things will cool off.

There is a HAMMERING noise, O.S.    Red looks over,
irritated.

<b>                           RED
</b>             Dammit, Al, what the hell you
             doing?

Al sits at a workbench hammering precious stones out of
Amy's jewelry. He looks over at Red.

<b>                           AL
</b>             Figured I'd get started on the
             jewelry.

<b>                           RED
</b>             Fuck that, you can work on it
             later. Help us with the girl.


<b>INT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff breathes in sharply, presses his eye against the
knothole.


<b>INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
Red unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of
the moving truck. He and Billy slide out a long metal
box, similar to a drawer in a morgue.

They lift the metal lid, revealing --


<b>CANVAS SACK
</b>
The sack is stained and ripped.    Red pokes at it.   The
sack doesn't move. Red shrugs.

<b>                       RED
</b>         Must've died from the exhaust.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      88.
</b>
<b>INT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff stares, paralyzed, his universe exploded.   Moisture
forms in his eyes.


<b>INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
Billy and Al reach into the compartment, start to lift
out the sack.

<b>                        RED
</b>          I'll get some plastic. We'll bury
          her before it gets light out.

Suddenly the sack drives its legs into Al's belly.

<b>                         AL
</b>                  (startled)
          Aagh!

Al falls backward, drops the sack on the floor. It tears
open revealing Amy -- gagged with duct tape, her wrists
and ankles taped. She squirms and kicks wildly, her
screams muffled.


<b>INT. BARN HAYLOFT KNOTHOLE - NIGHT
</b>
We see Jeff's eye in the knothole. It's all we need to
see to gauge the effect on him of seeing Amy alive.


<b>INT. BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
Al gets to his feet, furious.

<b>                         AL
</b>          Goddamn.   Scared me half to death.

<b>                        BILLY

                    (calling out)
             Just a second, Arleen.

Red walks to a corner, moves aside a section of false
flooring. He pulls up a hidden trap door, revealing a
root cellar.


<b>AMY
</b>
squirms on the hay-strewn floor. Her clothes are ripped,
face bruised. She looks up, reacting: Jeff's eye is
visible in the knothole.

Their gaze meets... and holds...


<b>RED
</b>
returns and takes Amy by the legs. Al and Billy lift her
by the arms. As they carry her to the root cellar, Red
peers into her terrified face.

<b>                          RED
</b>          Don't   worry, honey. It's not as
          bad as   it sounds. It'll take you
          about   10 minutes to suck the air
          out.    Probably won't even feel it.

Amy reacts, writhing even more violently, but she's no
match for the three men.


<b>BARN HAYLOFT
</b>
Jeff watches helplessly as...


<b>BARN GROUND FLOOR
</b>
The men disappear with Amy into the cellar. We hear a
METALLIC THUD, then a few moments later, the men reappear
without her. Red closes the trap door, secures it with a
heavy padlock, then slides the panel of false flooring
over it.

<b>                        RED
</b>          C'mon, let's go.

They turn, walk toward the door. Red opens it. Arleen
is standing there. Al and Billy greet her politely:

<b>                           RED
</b>             Sure thing, honey.

The barn goes dark as the men leave.        The barn door rolls
shut. A LOCK CLICKS.


<b>INT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff quickly climbs down a ladder in the pitch darkness.
He crosses the room, bumping into a workbench. He
swears, makes his way toward the...


<b>INT. REAR OF BARN - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff drops to his hands and knees, feeling for the
padlocked trap door. He finds it, speaks in an urgent
whisper.

<b>                            JEFF
</b>             Amy?   Amy, can you hear me?

No reply.     Jeff cups his hands, presses his mouth to the
floor.

<b>                            JEFF
</b>                     (louder)
             Amy?

Still no reply.

Jeff swears, glances around the dark room.       There is a
tool bench across the room.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>             Hang on, baby. They're in the
             house; I can't use the lights.
             I'm gonna get you out.

He goes to   the tool bench, fumbling in the darkness. He
knocks over   a cardboard box -- a pile of car keys spill
across the   table. His hands run over an assortment of
tools.  He   locates a hammer, takes it.

Returning to the trap door, Jeff inserts the claw in the
padlock and tries to pry it open. The lock won't give.

<b>                                                (CONTINUED)

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
He strains, using all his strength.     Suddenly the handle
snaps! Jeff flies backwards.

<b>                          JEFF
</b>             Fuck!

He gets up, goes to the tool bench. His hands feel over
and reject an assortment of small tools. He finds a
crowbar, returns to the trap door and inserts it into the
shackle, twisting with all his might. After several
failed attempts, he swears.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>             It's not working. If I make any
             more noise, they'll hear.

Jeff mulls his options.    He sets his jaw, exhales.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          I'm going to get you out of there,
          Amy.

He swallows, emotional, clearly torn.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          I love you.
                 (under his breath)
          Please, God, let her still be
          alive.


<b>INT. BARN - MOVING VAN CAB - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff opens the door. A weak dome light flickers on. He
climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the CB radio,
but no luck -- the keys are gone.

He opens the glove compartment. There are maps, trip
logs, truck stop receipts. He rifles through them
quickly.

Jeff frowns, gets on the floor of the cab and gropes
under the driver's seat. His eyes register a discovery.

He brings out a big black semi-automatic pistol.

Jeff studies the base of the grip, clearly unfamiliar
with guns. He fumbles with the clip, ejects it. The
clip is full of bullets.

He snaps the clip back in place.

<b>EXT. BARN - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff climbs out of the window onto the broad overhanging
eave. He steps to the edge of the roof and lowers
himself onto the Peterbilt cab, then drops to the ground.

He looks around. Red's is the only house visible. A
light flickers in the trees a mile away. It could be
anything.

Jeff moves toward the house.


<b>EXT. RED'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff holds the gun ready as he eases open the screen
door. The DOOR CREAKS on its hinges. Jeff steps into...


<b>INT. RED'S HOUSE - REAR ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff lets the door close silently. There are VOICES
coming from a distant room. He passes a washing machine,
a hamper full of dirty clothes, and moves silently
down...


<b>HALLWAY
</b>
toward the voices. VIDEO GAME sound effects emanate from
a room off the hall. Jeff flattens against the wall,
peers into the living room.

Seated on the floor with his back   to Jeff, Deke is
playing Nintendo on a wide-screen   television.  Various
items are scattered about: stereo    speakers, a jukebox, a
brand new Nordic Track. There is    a rifle rack across the
room.

Stepping past the doorway, Jeff continues down the hall
toward...


<b>INT. RED'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Red is in the middle of telling a story.    Arleen, Billy
and Al sit around the table.

The plates are cleared away.       They are drinking beer.

             chickens that are supposed to be
             in Denver days ago, and this cop
             is busting my balls because I
             haven't got chains...

Arleen and the men laugh heartily.

<b>                           RED
</b>             So what happens but   this big old
             rooster, damn thing   must've

             toward that highway   patrolman...

Al glances toward the door, stops laughing.         Billy and
Arleen follow his gaze, go silent.

<b>                           RED
</b>             ... just reaches out with his
             beak, see, and...

Red notices his audience is no longer paying attention.
He turns in his chair, sees --


<b>REVERSE ANGLE - JEFF

Standing in the doorway. Aiming the pistol. His clothes
caked with blood and dirt. He sways slightly.

Nobody else moves.

<b>                           JEFF

Arleen looks up at Jeff, scared.      She starts to open her
mouth, when --

Jeff turns. Nine-year-old Deke is aiming a rifle at Jeff
from the hallway. The rifle looks enormous in his hands.
The boy's lip quivers.

The room is silent. No one moves. Jeff keeps the pistol
aimed at Red. He swallows, speaks slowly:

             Do it.

Red fishes a key ring out of his pocket and extends it to
Arleen. She just stands there.

<b>                           RED

Arleen inserts a key, opens the padlock.

                    (turning to Deke)
             Deke, push the door open.
             Quickly.

Deke looks at his father. Red nods.         Deke goes to the
door, begins wheeling it open.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          That's enough, Deke.
                 (gesturing them
                  inside with gun)
          Let's go. Move it.

Jeff herds all four into --


<b>INT. BARN - NIGHT
</b>
Jeff leads the group through the barn at gun-point.

He glances right and left, wired. The rifle is strapped
to his back. He keeps the handgun ready. He peers under
the tractor-trailer, looking for any sign of Billy.

They reach the trap door. Jeff circles it, constantly
keeping an eye on Red and Al. He hands the keys to Deke.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Deke, I need you to open this.

Deke looks at his father. He kneels, unlocks the padlock
and heaves open the trap door, revealing a narrow
staircase slanting into the cellar.

Deke looks down into the darkness and swallows.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>             It's okay, Deke. There's a
             freezer down there with a woman in
             it. I need you to let her out.

Deke descends the steps, frightened.

<b>                           DEKE (O.S.)
</b>                    (voice quavering)
             I can't see.

Jeff jabs the pistol at Red:    Tell him where the light
is.

<b>                        RED
</b>                 (a beat, to Deke)
          The switch is on the right.

There's a CLICK and the light goes on in the cellar.
Deke lets out a yip of fear.

<b>                          DEKE (O.S.)
</b>          Dad...

<b>                        RED

          that stuff.

Jeff crouches to peer into the cellar.


<b>JEFF'S POV - CELLAR
</b>
Roots and mildew hang in strings from the ceiling. The
light is a bare bulb. There are several distressingly-
shaped garbage bags against the wall.


<b>BACK TO JEFF

His gaze shifts back to Red.

<b>                          JEFF

We hear a FREEZER BEING OPENED.

<b>                           DEKE
</b>             She's all tied up with tape.

<b>                           JEFF

</b>             Good man. Use that.   Make sure
             you don't hurt her.

They wait tensely while Deke works downstairs.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>                 (to Red)
          You better pray she's all right.

<b>                          DEKE (O.S.)

</b>          I'm almost free!!!

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          Amy, come up here!

Amy climbs the stairs quickly. Scraps of duct tape cling
to her wrists. She throws her arm around Jeff.

<b>                        AMY
</b>          They were going to kill me.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          I know, baby. It's okay.       They
          can't hurt you now.

While Amy embraces him, Jeff keeps the gun on Red and the
others. He gestures toward the cellar.

Nobody moves.

<b>                             JEFF
</b>             Do it!

Arleen and Al descend the steps.        Red follows, then
stops, halfway down.

<b>                           RED
</b>             Remember this moment, pretty boy.
             'Cause whatever happens, no matter
             how far you run, I will hunt you
             down and kill you like a dog.

Jeff stares back.       A beat, then:

<b>                             JEFF
</b>             Go to hell.

He boots Red in the chest, sending him backward down the
steps. He slams the trap door shut and locks the
padlock.

He looks around, sees a massive tool chest.         He tips it
onto the trap door -- crash!

Then he takes Amy's hand, still keeping an eye out for
Billy.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>             Let's get out of here.

They run from the barn.


<b>EXT. BARN - DAWN
</b>
The first rays of sunlight are beginning to poke over the
horizon.

Jeff wheels the barn door shut and locks it.         He sees Amy
running toward Red's house.

<b>                             JEFF

It's too much to explain. Jeff grabs her arm. As they
take off running toward the light flickering in the
distance.


<b>REVEAL BILLY
</b>
lurking in the shadows at the corner of the barn,
watching.


<b>EXT. FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAWN
</b>
Jeff and Amy are tiny figures sprinting across the flat
terrain, illuminated by the red glow of a rising sun.

<b>                                              CUT TO:

<b>EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAWN (MINUTES LATER)
</b>
The morning sky is lighter now.

A rickety trailer surrounded by a chicken coop, junked
appliances and a clothesline. There's an old utility
pickup truck parked in front. Jeff and Amy arrive out of
breath. Jeff pounds on the door.

<b>                            JEFF
</b>          Hello?   Hello?     Anybody home?

There's no answer. Jeff puts his shoulder to the door
and rams it open. The flimsy door gives way easily.


<b>INT. TRAILER - DAWN
</b>
Jeff enters. The place is ramshackle -- torn vinyl
furniture, empty beer bottles scattered about. A
tattered flag hangs on the wall. There's no one around.

<b>                        JEFF

Amy follows him inside, looks around. Jeff crosses the
room, snatches up a phone and dials 911.

While he waits for an answer, Amy leans the rifle against
the wall. She notices a set of car keys hanging by the
door.

Suddenly, the ROAR is DEAFENING --

The PETERBILT EXPLODES through the wall of the trailer
home!


<b>JEFF AND AMY
</b>
dive out of the way.


<b>INT. RED'S PETERBILT - DAY
</b>
Inside the truck cab, we catch a glimpse of Red behind
the wheel, shouting something inaudible. Fragments of
debris cling to the grille.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       103.

The rickety structure spins 360 degrees!

Jeff goes flying. A TELEVISION somersaults across the
room and EXPLODES. Amy slams into a wall.

The speeding Peterbilt shears away a section of the
trailer home with a horrible RIPPING sound!

The trailer home is suddenly open to the sky.


<b>INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY
</b>
Red puts the truck into a hard turn, circling for another
run at the devastated trailer.


<b>INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY
</b>
Jeff struggles to his knees.

<b>                             JEFF
</b>          Amy?!

Amy is crawling over the debris. Jeff pulls her to her
feet. He grabs the rifle and car keys.

<b>                             JEFF
</b>          C'mon!

They stagger through the gaping hole in the trailer.


<b>INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

Red sees Amy and Jeff flee the trailer and head for the
utility pickup. He throws the Peterbilt into a turn.


<b>YARD
</b>
Amy and Jeff run for the Ford F100 utility truck -- an
aging blue-collar workhorse equipped with side-mounted
toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder.


<b>IN FORD
</b>
Jeff keys the ignition. The ENGINE SPUTTERS. Amy whips
around to see the Peterbilt bearing down from the side.

Jeff turns the key. The ENGINE CATCHES!   He throws the
Ford in gear and floors the gas.

The Ford shoots out of the Peterbilt's path!


<b>HIGHWAY

The FORD PEELS OUT of the driveway and joins the road,
spewing exhaust. It's an old vehicle that doesn't
maneuver well.


<b>IN FORD

Jeff mashes the gas pedal. The ENGINE STRAINS,
BACKFIRING. Amy looks back, sees the Peterbilt joining
the road.

<b>                         AMY
</b>           Can't this thing go any faster?!

A SHOTGUN BLAST SHATTERS the passenger WINDOW! Amy
screams as glass showers the cab. Jeff swerves wildly.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>           What the fuck?!

He swivels his head right, sees --


<b>FIREBIRD
</b>
kicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the Ford
on the right-hand shoulder.

The driver, Billy, is levelling a shotgun through the
window.


<b>JEFF
</b>
cranks the wheel.

<b>                          JEFF

yelps as the passenger-side MIRROR DISINTEGRATES!    She
whips around, sees --


<b>CADILLAC DEVILLE

pulling even with them on Jeff's side. The drive, Al,
leers as he spins the wheel and creases the Ford --
<b>CRUNCH!

<b>JEFF

raises the PISTOL and FIRES!


<b>HIGHWAY
</b>
The Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird
as they race down the highway with the Peterbilt in the
rear.


<b>JEFF

lets out a cry as they carom off the Cadillac. Blood
flows in a trickle down his neck. Amy sees it,
panicking.

<b>                         JEFF

Amy raises the rifle, thrusts the barrel awkwardly out
the window and aims at Billy. She FIRES wildly -- BANG!


<b>BILLY
</b>
grins as the SHOT WHISTLES past harmlessly. He reloads
the SHOTGUN, snaps it shut and RETURNS FIRE -- BLAM!

The BLAST hits the Ford's side-mounted toolbox.     The door
flies open. Tools scatter on the road!

<b>BILLY

veers away, swearing, as hammers and chisels and power
tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path.

The front end of the extension ladder comes free from the
lumber rack and hinges into his path, SMASHING the
<b>WINDSHIELD!
</b>
<b>                         BILLY
</b>          Sonofabitch!

Billy swears and jerks the wheel, steering away. He
glances up suddenly, sees Jeff aiming the pistol.

The PISTOL FIRES!

Billy slams backward against the headrest, hit in the
face. There's blood everywhere. The car careens toward
the shoulder.


<b>HIGHWAY
</b>
The Firebird hits a mound of earth, flies through the air
and lands with a CRASH!


<b>IN PETERBILT
</b>
Red sees the crash, scowling. He presses the gas and
pulls closer, taking Billy's place alongside the Ford.


<b>IN FORD

Amy sees the Peterbilt advancing. Whipping her head to
the other side, she sees Al raising a pistol.

<b>                         AMY

Al jacks the trigger -- BLAM!    BLAM!


<b>ON PETERBILT
</b>
a STRAY BULLET SLICES the hydraulic brake line running to
the trailer. The HOSE HISSES and whips through the air!


<b>IN PETERBILT

Red swears and lets the truck fall back, swearing. Up
ahead is a long, curving downgrade. He taps the brakes.
There is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor.

<b>HIGHWAY

The Peterbilt descends the grade, letting out a RAPID-
FIRE BLAT of BACKFIRES. It's gaining speed, bearing down
on the Ford.


<b>IN FORD

Amy turns in the seat, terrified. The truck looms
closer. Jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor.

<b>                              JEFF
</b>             Hang on!

They are flying into a hairy curve.


<b>IN PETERBILT
</b>
Red struggles to stay in control. Every time he applies
the brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward.

The Peterbilt races into the curve.

Red has no choice. He has to pump the brakes and risk
jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road
altogether.

He hits the brakes!


<b>HIGHWAY
</b>
The huge TRUCK SCREECHES on the asphalt, tires smoking,
cab and trailer folding at right angles!

Then, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab!


<b>IN CADILLAC
</b>
Flanking the Peterbilt, Al glances to the side and sees
the trailer come untethered from the cab.

Now the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly
back and forth across the blacktop.

Al tries to swerve away. The trailer streaks toward him.
Al SLAMS on the BRAKES, screaming!

<b>HIGHWAY

The trailer piles into the Cadillac. There is a huge
IMPACT as trailer and Cadillac are reduced to scrap
metal!

And just as this is happening...


<b>PETERBILT
</b>
blasts into the rear of the Ford, jarring it forward with
a CRUNCH of METAL and taillights!


<b>JEFF
</b>
slams against the wheel. Amy is thrown against the
dashboard. The Ford is being propelled downhill by the
Peterbilt.


<b>HIGHWAY
</b>
The two vehicles are now locked together, gaining speed
as they hurtle down the grade.


<b>JEFF

jams the pistol through the rear pass-through window and
FIRES at Red in the truck. BULLETS PING off the grille.

The GUN CLICKS empty.


<b>IN PETERBILT
</b>
Red hits the brakes, but it's no use. The bumpers are
meshed. The two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding
sideways.

Up ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge.


<b>HIGHWAY
</b>
The Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge. The big
truck glances off a railing. The vehicles suddenly come
unlocked.

The FORD plows into the concrete railing with a CRASH!

The PETERBILT creams it from behind and caroms away,
SKIDDING the length of the bridge before SMACKING the
opposite railing!

Jeff grimaces. In front of them, the concrete railing

the gorge. The Ford's right front tire hangs in the air.

Jeff looks at Amy.   She looks wildly adrenalated, eyes
wide.

<b>                           JEFF

Amy looks back at him.   She expels a long breath and
nods.

Jeff forces his upper body through the driver's window
and looks over the Ford's roof at the Peterbilt.


<b>JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT
</b>
It's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge. The
engine is dead. STEAM HISSES from the crumpled radiator.
One tire is shredded.

There is blood on the broken windshield.


<b>BACK TO JEFF
</b>
sitting in the driver's window. He squints toward the
truck, searching for any sign of Red. There is none.

<b>                         AMY (O.S.)
</b>          Jeff...

<b>                         JEFF

<b>                        AMY (O.S.)
</b>          Jeff... I can't get out...

Jeff drops back into the cab. The dashboard is crushed
against Amy's legs. She tries to wriggle free.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          What is it?

<b>                        AMY
</b>                 (wriggling)
          It's just... I can't get out...

<b>                       JEFF

<b>CONTINUED:

<b>                           AMY
</b>             I mean I can't get out!

Jeff blinks. He climbs out of the Ford, runs around to
Amy's side and yanks the door. It comes open with a
CREAK of METAL.

Behind Jeff on the bridge, a MOTOR KICKS OVER.   He
whirls.


<b>JEFF'S POV - PETERBILT
</b>
EXHAUST BELCHES from the smokestacks. Red is behind the
wheel. His face is covered with blood. He stares
hatefully.

With a RASP of GEARS, the Peterbilt lurches forward.


<b>BACK TO JEFF
</b>
He pushes against the dashboard with life-or-death
urgency.

<b>                          JEFF
</b>            C'mon, Amy, push!

Amy struggles and struggles to free her legs.

<b>                          JEFF
</b>            Push, goddammit!

Amy glances toward the Peterbilt, terrified.


<b>PETERBILT
</b>
creeps toward the Ford. The truck's grille is smashed.
One wheel RIM SCRAPES the asphalt. It gains speed.


<b>IN FORD
</b>
Jeff crawls over Amy and tries pushing with his legs.
She winces as the metal cuts into her skin. Jeff
strains.

<b>                           AMY
</b>                    (turning, reacting)
            Jeff!

<b>PETERBILT
</b>
rams the rear of the FORD -- CRASH! It jars the pickup
farther through broken concrete guardrail.


<b>IN FORD
</b>
Jeff and Amy are thrown forward by the impact. The
Peterbilt's ENGINE ROARS. It's pushing them over the
edge!


<b>IN PETERBILT
</b>
Red's eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces
the pickup farther through the broken railing.


<b>FORD
</b>
lurches through the widening gap in the railing.
Concrete sails into the canyon. The front tires hang
over the void.


<b>IN FORD
</b>
Jeff strains against the dashboard. It won't give.     He
whips around, swearing, and leaps from the Ford.

<b>                           AMY
</b>                    (panicked)
            Jeff?


<b>ON BRIDGE
</b>
Jeff runs to the Peterbilt and jumps on the driver's side
running board, grasping the door handle.

Red heaves the door open suddenly. It strikes Jeff's
head with a crack! He falls backward to the ground.


<b>IN PETERBILT
</b>
Red presses the gas, yelling over the ENGINE ROAR. The
railing is giving way. He sees Jeff struggling to his
feet.

<b>                          RED
</b>            You think you can come into my
            life and fuck with me? Nobody
            fucks with me!

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
He looks down.   Jeff is no longer visible.   Red frowns.

Suddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff
surges into the cab, landing on Red, clawing at his eyes!

They grapple in the cab. Red swings an elbow into Jeff's
face -- crack. Jeff drives a fist to his jaw!

The steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck
inches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice.

Red gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering
wheel continues to move counter-clockwise...


<b>ON BRIDGE
</b>
The truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely.
Instead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up
and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the
Ford under its massive weight.


<b>IN PETERBILT
</b>
Red has both hands around Jeff's windpipe.    He glances up
for a second, reacts, but it's too late.


<b>ON BRIDGE
</b>
The Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the
Ford, using the pickup like a ramp!


<b>IN FORD
</b>
Amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened
under the Peterbilt's weight!


<b>ON BRIDGE
</b>
For an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang
in the air... then the truck is falling!


<b>IN PETERBILT
</b>
Red and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab, still
flailing at each other, as the truck plunges nose-first
into the gorge.

Then it jerks to a halt in mid-air!
<b>
</b><b>                                                       113.
</b>
<b>ON BRIDGE
</b>
The left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on
the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete
railing.

The Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge!


<b>IN PETERBILT
</b>
Jeff slams into the windshield. Red lands on top of him.
Loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield.

They grapple. Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply,
forcing it at an impossible angle. Their faces are
inches apart.

<b>                          RED
</b>            You think you can fuck with me?!

He headbutts Jeff viciously -- crack! Blood erupts from
Jeff's nose and mouth. Red is about to deliver another
blow when...

... the windshield falls away! The loose items in the
cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below.

Jeff drops through the windshield opening. He clings to
the center support column. His legs dangle over the
hood.

Red slips through the opening, his hand locking on the
steering wheel at the last instant.

The windshield sails away into the gorge.


<b>ON BRIDGE
</b>
The iron REBAR GROANS. It's beginning to give way under
the weight of the truck. The truck slips slightly.


<b>ON PETERBILT
</b>
Jeff feels the truck shifting. He grabs the windshield
wiper blade with his free hand. The blade snaps away.

Red is clinging to the steering wheel. He flails at Jeff
with his feet, swearing. Jeff is barely out of reach.

Jeff looks to the side. There is a grabhandle on the
corner of the cab. He reaches with his free hand and
seizes the handle.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      114.
</b>
<b>ON BRIDGE
</b>
The REBAR GROANS. The truck is wedged against the Ford.
As the truck slips, it forces the Ford closer to the
edge.


<b>ON PETERBILT
</b>
Jeff clings to the handle. He reaches for the passenger
side door handle, working his way up toward the bridge.


<b>REBAR
</b>
gives away once more and --


<b>JEFF
</b>
scales the cab, finding more handholds.   He climbs past
the passenger door.

Behind him, Red is working his way higher in the same
manner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the
cab.

Jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment.
Red grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release
button.

The passenger door flies open!

Red falls away as the door opens. He's clinging to the
open passenger door, suspended over the gorge.


<b>IN FORD
</b>
Amy breathes in sharply, feeling the Ford move closer to
the edge. She struggles to free her legs from the
dashboard.

<b>                          AMY
</b>            Oh God... Jeff...


<b>JEFF
</b>
climbs higher. The Peterbilt slips again.    Below, Red
loses his grip and almost falls.

Jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of
exertion. He runs to the passenger side of the Ford.

</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
The Ford teeters precariously. Any move could send it
over the edge. Jeff can only extend his hand to Amy over
the void.

<b>                          JEFF
</b>            C'mon, Amy, it's all you now...
            you can do it...

With a huge effort, Amy frees herself from the dashboard
and reaches for Jeff's outstretched hand just as --


<b>PETERBILT
</b>
comes free from the rebar!


<b>AMY
</b>
takes hold of Jeff's hand.


<b>PETERBILT
</b>
plummets into the canyon!


<b>RED
</b>
screams!


<b>PETERBILT
</b>
seems to fall forever... before landing with a huge
<b>EXPLOSION!
</b>

<b>ON BRIDGE
</b>
Jeff and Amy fall backward on the road. Down below,
secondary EXPLOSIONS rock the canyon. Jeff takes Amy in
his arms.

<b>                          AMY
</b>            Don't let me go, Jeff...

He looks into her eyes.   Their lips meet in a kiss and
we --

<b>EXT. RED'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the
house. RADIOS CHATTER. Yellow crime tape holds back
onlookers and news reporters.

Cops and evidence technicians work the scene. A
criminalist photographs stolen property as it's carried
out of the barn.

A plainclothes FBI AGENT closes a cellphone and walks
over to where Jeff and Amy are sitting at a picnic table.
They are battered and bandaged.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          How's the sheriff?

<b>                        FBI AGENT
</b>          Out of surgery. It looks like
          he's gonna make it. As for the
          wife and kid, she's not talking,
          he's being turned over to
          Protective Services.

Jeff nods soberly.

<b>                        FBI AGENT
</b>          We've got I.D. on the dead
          suspects. Turns out they were all
          licensed truckers. One of 'em had
          a rap for check kiting. Otherwise
          they could've been model citizens.

<b>                        JEFF
</b>          What about the leader?

<b>                        FBI AGENT
</b>          Same thing. His real name's
          Warren Claney. Three speeding
          tickets in five years -- apart
          from that, he's clean as a
          whistle.

Amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn.

<b>                         AMY
</b>                 (dazed)

<b>                       FBI AGENT

</b>             It was simple, efficient and
             organized. They stayed on the
             move, spread it over a dozen
             states. As long as no witnesses
             survived, it's an untraceable
             crime.
                    (looking at them)
             You were just a couple of the
             lucky ones.

Up ahead, a television news helicopter is landing on the
road. A cameraman, reporter and producer hurry over.

Jeff watches the news crew, a bemused expression.   It
seems like a million years ago...

The FBI Agent shakes his head, disdainful.

<b>                       FBI

         C'mon -- let's get you folks out
         of here before things really get
         hairy.

He escorts them to a waiting sedan. As they climb in,
Jeff looks back over his shoulder, surveying the scene
one last time.

He gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied
news crew arrives, mikes and cameras at the ready,
running alongside the departing sedan, shouting
questions.

Through the rear window, we see Jeff putting his arm
around Amy, pulling her close as we hear:

<b>                        AMY

</b>          Next time... we fly.


<b>EXT. HOUSE - AERIAL - DAY

Over this last line, the sedan drives away, and we CLIMB
HIGHER and HIGHER AWAY FROM the bristling crime scene
until the ranch house is just one in a town of modest
houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in
every direction.
