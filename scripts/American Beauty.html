INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

On VIDEO: JANE BURNHAM lays in bed, wearing a tank top. She's
sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          I need a father who's a role model, not
          some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his
          shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home
          from school.
              (snorts)
          What a lame-o. Somebody really should put
          him out of his misery.

Her mind wanders for a beat.

<b>                    RICKY (O.C.)
</b>          Want me to kill him for you?

Jane looks at us and sits up.

<b>                    JANE
</b>              (deadpan)
          Yeah, would you?

<b>EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING
</b>
We're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward
a tree-lined street.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          My name is Lester Burnham. This is my
          neighborhood. This is my street. This...
          is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In
          less than a year, I'll be dead.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:

LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens,
face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS.
Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          Of course, I don't know that yet. He
          rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He
          doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect
          of a new day.

</b>

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And in a way, I'm dead already.

He sits up and puts on his slippers.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.

ANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is
silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes
apparent he is masturbating.

<b>                     LESTER (V.O.)
</b>              (amused)
          Look at me, jerking off in the shower.
              (then)
          This will be the high point of my day.
          It's all downhill from here.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand
with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.

CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham
house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears
color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and
expensive tools.

Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor,
peeping out through the drapes.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the
          handle on those pruning shears matches
          her gardening clogs? That's not an
          accident.

<b>EXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS
repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises
the barking dog.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          That's our next-door neighbor Jim.

A second MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #2) comes out of the
house.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And that's his lover, Jim.

<b>                    JIM #2
</b>              (re: barking dog)
          What in the world is wrong with her? She
          had a walk this morning.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          And a jerky treat.

<b>                    JIM #2
</b>          You spoil her.
              (sternly)
          Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Lester watches all this from the window.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Good morning, Jim!

Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          Morning, Carolyn.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>              (overly friendly)
          I just love your tie! That color!

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          I just love your roses. How do you get
          them to flourish like this?

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and
          Miracle Grow.

Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is
watching them.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          Man. I get exhausted just watching her.

Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying,
but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          She wasn't always like this. She used to
          be happy. We used to be happy.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
JANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          My daughter Jane. Only child.

CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE
window suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a
PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical "before" and
"after" photos of surgically augmented breasts.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry,
          insecure, confused. I wish I could tell
          her that's all going to pass...

Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her
<b>BACKPACK.
</b>
<b>                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          But I don't want to lie to her.

We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself
in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her
breasts.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ
ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the
HORN again.

Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her
shoulder.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look
          unattractive?

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Yes.

<b>                     CAROLYN
</b>          Well, congratulations. You've succeeded
          admirably.

Jane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door,
carrying a BRIEFCASE.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
</b>          Lester, could you make me a little later,
          please? Because I'm not quite late
          enough.

Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill
all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather
everything.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Nice going, Dad.

Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.

His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also
bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          Both my wife and daughter think I'm this
          gigantic loser, and... they're right.

<b>INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
Carolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is
asleep in the back seat.

<b>                    LESTER (V.O.)
</b>          I have lost something. I'm not exactly
          sure what it is, but I know I didn't
          always feel this... sedated. But you know
          what? It's never too late to get it back.

<b>INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</b>
Lester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by
IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor
and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on
his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his
voice.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media
          Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr.
          Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under
          a deadline here, uh, but you see, there
          is some basic information about the
          product launch that isn't even covered in
          your press release and I... Yeah. Can I
          ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does
          he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to

BRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes
Lester, who is unaware of his presence.

<b>                    LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>          It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you!

Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated.

<b>                    BRAD
</b>          Hey Les. You got a minute?

Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorily

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          For you, Brad? I've got five.

<b>INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.

<b>                    BRAD
</b>          I'm sure you can understand our need to
          cut corners around here.

Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta
          free up cash. Gotta spend money to make
          money. Right?

<b>                    BRAD
</b>          Exactly. So...

Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>              (blurts)
          Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the
          company MasterCard to pay for that
          hooker, and then she used the card
          numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for,
          what was it, like, three months?

<b>                    BRAD
</b>              (startled)
          That's unsubstantiated gossip.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          That's fifty thousand dollars. That's
          somebody's salary. That's somebody who's
          gonna get fired because Craig has to pay

</b>

<b>                    BRAD
</b>          Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired
          yet. That's why we're having everyone
          write out a job description, mapping out
          in detail how they contribute. That way,
          management can assess who's valuable and--

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Who's expendable.

<b>                    BRAD
</b>          It's just business.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>              (angry)
          I've been writing for this magazine for
          fourteen years, Brad. You've been here
          how long, a whole month?

<b>                    BRAD
</b>              (frank)
          I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying
          to level with you. This is your one
          chance to save your job.

Lester stares at him, powerless.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next
door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the
house.

The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn
drives, Lester is in the passenger seat.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          --there is no decision, you just write

</b>          Possibly. But you don't want to be
          unemployed.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls

As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS
next door.

<b>                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
</b>          So we've finally got new neighbors. You
          know, if the Lomans had let me represent
          them, instead of--
              (heavy disdain)
          --"The Real Estate King," that house
          would never have sat on the market for
          six months.

She heads into the house, followed by Lester.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Well, they were still mad at you for
          cutting down their sycamore.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial
          portion of the root structure was on our
          property. You know that. How can you call
          it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the
          heart to just cut down something if it
          wasn't partially mine, which of course it
          was.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
We HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.

Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT.
RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table.
Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody
else's presence, until...

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Mom, do we always have to listen to this

<b>                    CAROLYN

          No. No, we don't. As soon as you've
          prepared a nutritious yet savory meal
          that I'm about to eat, you can listen to
          whatever you like.

A long beat. Lester suddenly turns to Jane.

          to make it seem like they're justified in
          firing somebody, because they couldn't
          just come right out and say that, could
          they? No, no, that would be too...

Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves. We FOLLOW
HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester
calling after her.

CLOSE on the face of   RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen
of his DIGICAM as he   videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his
eyes are much older.   Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks
something wounded...   and dangerous.

His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester
at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His
head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes
he's being watched.

Lester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at
the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer
there.

Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the
towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a
framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger
Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park.

It's startling how happy they look.

<b>EXT. SALE HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads:

<b>OPEN HOUSE TODAY
</b>
<b>BURNHAM & ASSOCIATES REALTY
</b>
555-0195 Carolyn Burnham

The sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a   run-down
neighborhood. The Mercedes is parked in front of the   house.
Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading   a box of
cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the   Mercedes
when something across the street catches her eye.

Her POV: In front of a different house with much more curb
appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome
silver-haired MAN. It reads:

Another One SOLD By Buddy Kane

The Real Estate King 555-0100

Carolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut.

The interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless.
Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly
announces:

She neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then
strips down to her undergarments.

We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she:

Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool;

Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen;

Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan
in the master bedroom;

And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.

Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself:

more, applying lipstick. She stares at her reflection
critically.

She says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge
on the mirror and wipes it off.

Carolyn enters, alone. She's furious. She locks the sliding
glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then
stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows
across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that
seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS
herself, hard.

But the tears continue. She SLAPS herself again.

She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying. She
stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything
under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all
business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark,
empty room.

We HEAR CHEERING and APPLAUSE.

Seated in the bleachers, next to the high school BAND, is a
group of about twenty TEENAGE GIRLS, dressed in pale blue and
white uniforms. Among them, Jane sits next to ANGELA HAYES.
At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even
features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the
archetypal American dream girl.

Jane stands and scans the bleachers.

          And now, for your half-time

In the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          We can leave right after this, right?

The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays "ON BROADWAY." On the gym floor,
the girls perform. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to
carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting.

Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter.

His POV: Jane performs well, concentrating. Dancing awkwardly
next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and
smiles... a lazy, insolent smile.

Lester leans forward in his seat.

His POV: We're focused on Angela now. Everything starts to
SLOW DOWN... the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO...

We ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed.

His POV: Angela's awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace, and
"ON BROADWAY" FADES into dreamy, hypnotic MUSIC. The light on
Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR
entirely.

Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound.

His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for
Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she
starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression
that's both innocent and knowing, then... she pulls her
uniform OPEN and a profusion of RED ROSE PETALS spill
forth... and we SMASH CUT TO:

Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book.
We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom. He grabs
Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his
ear, nervous.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>              (over phone line)
          Hello? Hello?

Lester is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the SHOWER is
turned off in the next room. Lester hangs up and exits
quickly. A moment, then the PHONE RINGS. Jane emerges from
the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her
wet hair. She picks up the PHONE.

<b>                      JANE
</b>          Hello?

<b>INT. HAYES HOUSE - ANGELA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          Why'd you call me?

<b>                                     INTERCUT WITH JANE IN HER

</b>          I didn't.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          Well, my phone just rang and I answered
          it and somebody hung up and then I star
          sixty-nined and it called you back.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          I was in the shower.

Then Jane notices her address book open to the H page.

<b>                       JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, gross.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in. Jane
picks up the address book, frowning. She speaks into the
phone, but we can't hear her.

<b>                    WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)

          Rick-y! Break-fast!

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky stands at his window, videotaping. He lowers his
Digicam, but his eyes remain locked on Jane across the way.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Be right there.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
BARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips
mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. At least ten years
younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish
way. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street
Journal. Ricky enters.

<b>                       RICKY
</b>          Mom.

Startled, Barbara turns to him.

<b>                       BARBARA
</b>          Hello.

As she attempts to serve him bacon:

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          I don't eat bacon, remember?

<b>                    BARBARA
</b>              (unnerved)
          I'm sorry, I must have forgotten.

Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then
joins his father at the table.

A DOORBELL rings. The Colonel and Barbara look at each other,
alarmed.

<b>                    COLONEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Are you expecting anyone?

<b>                     BARBARA
</b>          No.
                (thinks)
          No.

The Colonel heads toward the living room, a little puffed up.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

The Colonel opens the front door to reveal the two JIMS.

<b>                     JIM #1
</b>          Hi.

<b>                    JIM #2
</b>          Welcome to the neighborhood.

Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables and
a small white cardboard box tied with raffia.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          Just a little something from our garden.

<b>                     JIM #2
</b>          Except for the pasta, we got that at
          Fallaci's.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          It's unbelievably fresh. You just drop it
          in the water and it's done.

The Colonel stares at them, suspicious.

<b>                    JIM #1 (CONT'D)
</b>              (offers his hand)
          Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down. Welcome to

<b>                    COLONEL
</b>          Let's cut to the chase, okay? What are
          you guys selling?

<b>                    JIM #2
</b>              (after a beat)
          Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our
          new neighbors--

<b>                    COLONEL
</b>          Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you said you're
          partners. So what's your business?

The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel.

<b>                    JIM #1
</b>          Well, he's a tax attorney.

<b>                    JIM #2
</b>          And he's an anesthesiologist.

The Colonel looks at them, confused. Then it dawns on him.

<b>INT. COLONEL'S FORD EXPLORER - LATER
</b>
The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead. In the
passenger seat, Ricky is using a CALCULATOR and jotting
numbers down in a NOTEBOOK.

<b>                     COLONEL
</b>          How come these faggots always have to rub
          it in your face? How can they be so

</b>          That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't
          feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.

The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply.

<b>                    COLONEL
</b>          Well, it is.

A beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, before he
realizes a response is expected from him. Then:

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Yeah, you're right.

The Colonel's eyes flash angrily.

<b>                    COLONEL
</b>          Don't placate me like I'm your mother,
          boy.

Ricky sighs, then looks at his father.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly,
          but those fags make me want to puke my
          fucking guts out.

The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers.

<b>                    COLONEL
</b>          Me too, son. Me too.

Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations.

CLOSE on the pencil in his hands: He's totaling two columns
of NUMBERS. Under the column "Income" he writes in swift,
bold strokes: $24,950.00.

<b>EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - A SHORT TIME LATER

Jane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          I'm serious, he just pulled down his
          pants and yanked it out. You know, like,
          say hello to Mr. Happy.

<b>TEENAGE GIRL #1
</b>
Gross.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.

<b>TEENAGE GIRL #1
</b>
So, did you do it with him?

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          Of course I did. He is a really well-
          known photographer? He shoots for Elle on

          so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.

You are a total prostitute.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          Hey. That's how things really are. You
          just don't know, because you're this
          pampered little suburban chick.

<b>TEENAGE GIRL #2
</b>
So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you
looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy
Turlington.

The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela.

<b>                     ANGELA
</b>              (calling off)
          Cunt!
              (then)
          I am so sick of people taking their
          insecurities out on me.

The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed
          me last night.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift
          when I was in ninth grade, and he would
          always say the most random, weird things,
          and then one day, he was just like, gone.
          And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his
          parents had to put him in a mental
          institution.

<b>                    JANE

Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.

</b>          You total slut. You've got a crush on
          him.

          babies.

<b>                     JANE

Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next
          door to you.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          I know. I kinda remember this really
          creepy incident when you were filming me
          last night?

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          I didn't mean to scare you. I just think
          you're interesting.

Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Thanks, but I really don't need to have
          some psycho obsessing about me right now.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.

He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is
unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          What a freak. And why does he dress like
          a Bible salesman?

The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching

startles her.

We HEAR a door opening elsewhere in the house, and Ricky
enters.

<b>                    CAROLYN

does right now.

              (his face close to hers)
          I'll be whatever you want me to be.

of sex--then turns to the others and grins.

</b>          Well. I don't know about you, but I need
          a drink.

He crosses off. Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go.

<b>INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.

The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to
face the center of the room.

His POV: Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on:
smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.

Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a
waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses.

<b>                    RICKY

          Yeah.

<b>                    RICKY

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Hi, Lester Burnham.

A beat. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the
rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there,
watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does
this kid want?

<b>                    RICKY (CONT'D)

Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued.

Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has
wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused.

</b>          You know, I probably wouldn't even tell
          you this if I weren't a little tipsy,
          but... I am in complete awe of you. I

          Royce of local Real Estate firms, and
          your personal sales record is, is, is
          very intimidating. You know, I'd love to
          sit down with you and just pick your
          brain, if you'd ever be willing. I
          suppose, technically, I'm the
          "competition," but... I mean, hey, I
          don't flatter myself that I'm even in the
          same league as you...

They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This
situation is loaded and they both know it.

<b>EXT. HOTEL - LATER

Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service
entrance to the hotel, smoking a JOINT.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          ...did you ever see that movie, where the

Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large CATERING

joint.

He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs.

<b>                     LESTER
</b>          I think you just became my personal hero.

              (then)
          I just do these gigs as a cover. I have
          other sources of income. But my dad
          interferes less in my life when I pretend
          to be an upstanding young citizen with a

Jane and Angela are watching MTV. We HEAR the back door open.

</b>          Oh, shit. They're home. Quick, let's go

Jane switches off the TV.

Lester enters and opens the refrigerator.

He turns, and is instantly transfixed by:

His POV: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair.

<b>                    ANGELA (CONT'D)

She starts toward him.

          wound up.

          Ooh, is that root beer?

She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. As she
does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's
shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all
sound FADES...

EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his
shoulder in SLOW MOTION. We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of
her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its
unnatural, hollow ECHO...

BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him.

CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then:

He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems
shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him    with
surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her    in
awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes    widen
as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we    SMASH

Jane watches from the doorway to the family room, feeling
incredibly awkward in her own home. Carolyn enters from the
dining room. Lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer
from the refrigerator.

He takes a sip of his root beer, but it goes down the wrong
way and he starts COUGHING violently.

Angela lays on the bed, in bra and panties, reading a
magazine. Jane, in an oversized T shirt, plays a video game
on her computer.

          What a phony.

Jane glances at Angela, irritated.

ear up against the door. He can't believe what he's hearing.

          If he built up his chest and arms, I
          would totally fuck him.

Jane covers her ears and starts SINGING to drown her out.

          I would! I would suck your dad's big fat

Jane's SINGING stops.

On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, looking in. Jane
tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her.
Irritated, Jane retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her,
even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not
interested in Angela. The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane,
who has disappeared. Finally, we settle on the small make-up
MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her
computer. She's smiling. Then suddenly the DRAPES CLOSE and
she's gone.

for something as if his very life depended on it.

He yanks aside COLLEGE YEARBOOKS, a racquetball RACQUET,
boxes of old HOT ROD MAGAZINES, an unopened remote-controlled
MODEL JEEP KIT, stacks of old vinyl LPs... finally his face
lights up when he finds:

A pair of DUMBBELLS obviously unused for many years.

Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.
He glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he
pulls off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath. He eyes
himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape.
Just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be
hard to shed. He kicks off his shoes and begins to step out
of his pants.

Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a
light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art

          Well. Good night, son.

He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks
his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses
to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes
out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer,
already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a

</b>          You've been working out, haven't you? I

She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively.

</b>          I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm
          very, very dirty.

Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into
the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her
head back... and we SMASH CUT TO:

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic
BRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.

She flips over and faces him.

A beat.

</b>          All right, so shoot me. I was whacking
          off.

Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled. Lester LAUGHS.

She sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where
she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels
good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers
contentedly.

</b>          It's a great thing when you realize you

Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as
Lester runs INTO FRAME, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair
of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches
up, then the three men run together in the early morning
light.

<b>EXT. FITTS HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub
the bumper, when something Catches his eye:

His POV: Lester and the Jims jog down the street.

The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the
house, holding the URINE SAMPLE in front of him.

<b>                    COLONEL
</b>          What is this, the fucking gay pride

Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and
the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and
bends over, panting.

follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark.

Ricky enters, followed by Lester.

clothing out and piles it on his bed.

Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it.

emptied the drawer, now removes a FALSE BOTTOM, revealing
rows of MARIJUANA, tightly packed in ZIP-LOC BAGS.

<b>EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATER

Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut ROSES, passes by the
GARAGE WINDOW. From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.

Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning. She peers through
the window.

WEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.

ROCK MUSIC blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor.

The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary.
An ugly but comfortable 70's BOWL CHAIR has been pulled out
and cleaned off, his old hot rod magazines strewn across it,
and the remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT is spread across a
card table. The SHELVES that Lester tore through earlier have
been dismantled, leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a

Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the
weights in their rack and sits up. As he takes a drag off a
joint, the GARAGE DOOR suddenly starts to open. Lester looks
up, squinting at:

against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a REMOTE at us.

a box on his shoulder. He's happier than he's been in years.

<b>INT. RESTAURANT - LATER THAT DAY

Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought. There are two menus
on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate
King, joins her. Carolyn immediately becomes warm and
gracious.

Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name.

<b>                    BUDDY
</b>          I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy
          left for New York this morning, and...
          let's just say things were very hectic
          around the house.

<b>                    CAROLYN

              (off Carolyn's look)
          Yes. We are splitting up.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Buddy. I'm so sorry.

<b>                    BUDDY
</b>              (bitterly)
          Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on
          my career. As if being driven to succeed
          is some sort of character flaw. Well, she
          certainly knew how to take advantage of
          the lifestyle my success afforded her.
          Oh. Wow.
              (then, laughing)
          Ah, it's for the best.

<b>                    BUDDY
</b>          Well, call me crazy, but it is my
          philosophy that in order to be
          successful, one must project an image of
          success, at all times.

He smiles, then opens his menu. Carolyn picks hers up
mechanically, but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like
a fervent Christian who's just come face to face with Jesus.

Something is floating across from us... it's an empty,
wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG. We follow it as the wind carries
it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about
violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...

          Sometimes there's so much beauty in the
          world I feel like I can't take it... and
          my heart is going to cave in.

After a moment, Jane takes his hand. Then she leans in and
kisses him softly on the lips. His eyes scan hers, curious to
see how she reacts to this...

voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle. Across from him,
Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with contempt. EASY-

          No, no, that's quite all right, dear.
          Your father and I were just discussing

              (to Lester)
          Why don't you tell our daughter about it,

Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive. Lester looks
at Carolyn darkly, then flashes a "you-asked-for-it" grin.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Janie, today I quit my job. And then I
          told my boss to fuck himself, and then I
          blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand
          dollars. Pass the asparagus.

himself.

Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with
such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane.

happened. Carolyn sits in her chair, shivering with rage.

</b>          You ungrateful little brat. Just look at

Embarrassed, she quickly leaves. Jane looks in a mirror and
rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out.

<b>EXT. FITTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Jane's POV: We're across from Ricky's room, looking in. He
stands at the window with his DIGICAM, videotaping us. On the
WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window
as she looks across at him. She waves. Ricky just keeps
videotaping. A beat, then she starts to take off her shirt.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

We're behind Ricky as he videotapes Jane in her window. She
has now removed her shirt. She stands there in her bra, then
reaches behind her back to unhook the bra.

On VIDEO: We ZOOM toward her as she takes off her bra
clumsily. She's obviously embarrassed, but she's gone this
far and there's no turning back. She stands there with her
breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly
vulnerable...

Suddenly, the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters,
incensed. Startled, Ricky turns around. As soon as his eyes
meet his father's, he knows what's up.

<b>                    COLONEL
</b>          You little bastard--

Ricky scrambles to dodge his father, but the Colonel is too
fast; he punches Ricky in the face, knocking him to the
floor.

behind the drape. She quickly pulls it shut.

his face, and he reaches out to touch Ricky's cheek.

But something keeps him from doing it.

He leaves. Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau. He looks at

to wipe the blood from his face.

<b>INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - LATER
</b>
Bobby Darin sings "DON'T RAIN ON MY    PARADE" on the RADIO.
Carolyn SINGS along as she drives.    Her face has lost its
usual resolute determination; she's    actually enjoying herself
spontaneously, and the lack of her    usual self-consciousness
allows us to see just how beautiful    she is.

ANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst
some CDs.

Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring
it as she continues to SING.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lester's REMOTE-CONTROLLED MODEL JEEP is zooming across the
floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and
narrowly avoiding crashing.

Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a
BEER and controlling the car. His working out is beginning to
produce results. The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more
lived in.

Carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry. She
just stands there, staring at Lester. After a moment, he

          Don't.

We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room.

A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM. Ricky holds the
camera, sitting naked in a chair. It's been almost a month
since his father beat him up, and there are still slight
SCARS on his face. He's aiming his camera at Jane.

<b>                      RICKY
</b>          Why?

<b>                    JANE
</b>              (re: image on TV)
          It's weird, watching myself. I don't like
          how I look.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          I can't believe you don't know how
          beautiful you are.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          I'm not going to sit here for that shit.

She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him.
We see his image on the TV as she videotapes.

<b>                    JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Ha. How does it feel now?

<b>                      RICKY
</b>          Fine.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          You don't feel naked?

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          I am naked.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          You know what I mean.

Jane ZOOMS in on his face, which remains placid.

<b>                    JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Tell me about being in the hospital.

Ricky smiles.

<b>                     RICKY
</b>          When I was fifteen, my dad caught me
          smoking dope. He totally freaked and
          decided to send me to military school. I
          told you his whole thing about structure
          and discipline, right?
              (laughs)
          Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad
          and I had this huge fight, and he hit
          me... and then the next day at school,
          some kid made a crack about my haircut,
          and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill
          him. And I would have. Killed him. If
          they hadn't pulled me off.
              (then)
          That's when my dad put me in the
          hospital. Then they drugged me up and
          left me in there for two years.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Wow. You must really hate him.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          He's not a bad man.

He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Well... you better believe I'd hate my
          father if he did something like that to
          me.
              (laughs)
          Wait. I do hate my father.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Why?

He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses
it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          He's a total asshole and he's got this
          crush on my friend Angela and it's
          disgusting.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          You'd rather he had the crush on you?

<b>                     JANE

          anywhere near as important to him as she

          psychological damage to me.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          How?

Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Well, now, I too need structure. A little
          fucking discipline.

They LAUGH. She lays back on the bed.

<b>                    JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm serious, though. How could he not be
          damaging me? I need a father who's a role
          model, not some horny geek-boy who's
          gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a
          girlfriend home from school.
              (snorts)
          What a lame-o. Somebody really should put
          him out of his misery.

Her mind wanders for a beat.

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Want me to kill him for you?

Jane looks at him and sits up.

</b>          Yeah, would you?

<b>                    RICKY

          It'll cost you.

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was
          about ten. I've got almost three thousand
          dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for
          a boob job.

She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the
bed, LAUGHING.

<b>                    JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          But my tits can wait, huh?

<b>                    RICKY

She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off and the
TV screen goes BLUE. He lowers the camera and looks at her
intently.

<b>                       RICKY

He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long
moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair,
gazing into her eyes.

<b>EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING
</b>
We're FLYING above Robin Hood Trail. We see the BURNHAM'S
HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Remember those posters that said, "Today
          is the first day of the rest of your
          life?" Well, that's true of every day
          except one.
              (a beat)
          The day you die.

We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester,
wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front
door and dashes up the driveway.

<b>EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - A SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He
carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC
as he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins,
reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes
himself a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape; even
his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident,
easy swagger of an athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the
kitchen table.

Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking
his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's
got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable,
and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup,
avoiding his eyes, and starts out.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important
          appointment--

<b>                    JANE
</b>          Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over
          tonight?

Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. He doesn't.

<b>                    CAROLYN
</b>          Well, of course, she's always welcome.
              (on her way out)
          You know, I thought maybe you two had a
          fight. I haven't seen her around here in
          a while.

And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father.
Finally, he glances over at her.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          What?

<b>                    JANE
</b>              (nervous)
          I've been too embarrassed to bring her
          over. Because of you, and the way that
          you behave.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          What are you talking about? I've barely
          even spoken to her.

          just like your mother.

Jane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the
kitchen before she starts crying.

ANGLE on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes.

<b>                    LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>              (under his breath)

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open
door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau
mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost
gone now.

A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door
looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky
looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious.

<b>                    COLONEL

          in with Jane and her mom.

<b>EXT. FITTS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who
watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house.

His POV: Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an
insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat
and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester
emerges from the house in his sweatpants.

<b>                    LESTER
</b>          Yo, Ricky. How's it going?

<b>                    RICKY
</b>          Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

Ricky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths "call
me" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment.

CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.

As the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances
over at him.

Lester's POV: The Colonel watches the car driving off, then
looks at us. His face tightens.

LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes
before going inside the house.

CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He
starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in
which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't
discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his
eyes finally landing on:

The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera
is still connected to the TV.

The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses
"play." The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to...

On VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring
off into space.

The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. He
takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. On
the TV screen we see...

On VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester
step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his
black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them,
watching his reflection in the window as he does...

The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized.

burgers on a grill.

          In order to be successful, one must
          project an image of success. At all
          times.

She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to
him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and
shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS
herself, hard.

<b>                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
</b>          Stop it. Stop it!

She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then
suddenly SCREAMS as loud as she can.

<b>EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the
parking lot. We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING.
There is a sound of distant THUNDER.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - THAT NIGHT
</b>
It's RAINING outside. We HEAR ROCK MUSIC as Lester pumps
iron. He puts the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in
the window:

His POV: His arms are pumped. He smiles.

He reaches under the bench and grabs a CIGAR BOX. Opening it,
he digs through MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA, only to pull out an
empty ZIP-LOC BAG.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence.
Barbara rinses off a pan at the sink, then stares at it as if
she can't quite remember what she meant to do with it. We
suddenly HEAR a BEEPING noise. Ricky pulls his BEEPER off his
belt and checks it.

He heads into the hall. The Colonel watches him go, uneasy.

The Colonel rinses off his plate at the sink. Something
outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a
better look at...

His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see into
the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW. Our view is blurred by the RAIN,
but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in
sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS... and then Ricky walks
into view.

The Colonel's face tightens.

His POV: Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him
the money. We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he
looks naked.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Ricky, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash in his
pocket. Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder.

          such a pushover. "No I can't. Really.
          Okay."

And he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest. Ricky grins, then
squats down and reaches under the weight bench.

<b>                    RICKY

Lester sits in the bowl chair and leans back, his hands
behind his head, watching Ricky roll the joint.

<b>INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair. We see
only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint. After
a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back.
From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving
Lester a blow job.

The Colonel watches, incredulous. Then we HEAR a CAR
APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:

His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping
behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run
toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW.
Ricky stands, looking a little panicked. Lester pulls on his
T-shirt, and both he and Ricky cross out of view.

<b>INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Lester leans nonchalantly against the counter. Jane and
Angela enter. Jane frowns when she sees him.

He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.

          out?

<b>                    LESTER

Jane rolls her eyes and exits. Angela walks over to Lester.

<b>                    ANGELA
</b>          You can really tell. Look at those arms.

She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him
and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.

But something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all.
He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.

His voice is low and intense. She moves away, suddenly
insecure.

And she heads out quickly. Lester watches her go, baffled.

bureau, pulling the wad of CASH out of his pocket as he goes.

Ricky takes a step back.

break free from his father, and he can't believe it was this
simple.

leaving the Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing
heavily.

Ricky enters to discover Barbara standing in the middle of
the room, clutching a dish, frightened. She's obviously heard
his argument with his father, and she looks into his eyes,
searching, aware that something eventful is taking place.

The Colonel moves closer towards him.

He grins... and so does the Colonel.

He places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder. The Colonel
closes his eyes.

concerned.

The Colonel reaches up and places his hand on Lester's
cheek... and then kisses him. Lester is momentarily stunned,
and then he pushes the Colonel away. The Colonel's face
crumples in shame.

and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night.

His POV: AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into
view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case. She's been
crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed. She regards
us apprehensively... then puts on a slightly defiant smile.

<b>                    ANGELA

pretty bad at it. Lester raises his eyebrows.

disconnected from what's happening. Lester pulls her blouse

actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and
then...

This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's

stroking her hair and rocking her gently.

wondering why he should suddenly feel so content.

          I'm great.

Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he
reaches for...

CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the
photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several
years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they
look.

Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and
studies the photo. He suddenly seems older, more mature...
and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who
just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long

          like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's
          too much, my heart fills up like a
          balloon that's about to burst...

          trying to hold on to it, and then it
          flows through me like rain and I can't
          feel anything but gratitude for every
          single moment of my stupid little life...
              (amused)
          You have no idea what I'm talking about,
          I'm sure. But don't worry...
