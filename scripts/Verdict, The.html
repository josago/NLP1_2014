<b>               INT. FIRST FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
</b>
               A working-class funeral in progress. THIRTY PEOPLE and an 
               inexpensive bier SEEN from the back of the hall.

               A MAN's back FILLS the SCREEN. He is dressed in a black suit; 
               his hands are clasped behind him. ANOTHER MAN stands next to 
               him. The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and 
               puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands.

               The WIDOW. A woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier 
               receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First 
               Man (the recipient of the money) speaks:

</b>                         Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a 
                         very good friend of ours, and a very

                         Mrs. Dee.

               The Widow nods.

</b>                         I knew him vaguely through the Lodge. 
                         He was a wonderful man.
                              (shakes head in 
                              sympathy)
                         It was a crime what happened to him. 
                         A crime. If there's anything that I 
                         could do to help...

               GALVIN removes a business card from his jacket pocket and 
               hands it to her as if he were giving her money. (i.e., "Take 
               it. Really. I want you to have it..." She takes the card.

               Beat.

                              he is usurping her

                         Well... 

               He shakes her hand and moves on.

               Galvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops 
               of tea. His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table.

               He moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section.

               We SEE several names crossed out. He circles one funeral

               Galvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging 
               himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the BEREAVED WIDOW 
               sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from 
               his pocket, starts to speak. He is stopped by the WIDOW'S 
               SON, a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself 
               between Galvin and the widow.

               The FUNERAL MANAGER hurries down the aisle, and starts 
               extricating Galvin from the commotion.

               He is manhandling Galvin toward the back of the funeral

               The Funeral Manager gives Galvin a small shove, and goes 
               back to his post at the door, greeting the entering mourners.

               "Good evening..."

               Galvin walking down a residential street. He has been walking 
               a while in the cold, snowy night. He stops for a stoplight 
               at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic.

               Lights a cigarette. The light changes. He looks both ways 
               and irresolutely starts across the street. He stops. He checks 
               his watch. He sighs, and starts back in the opposite 
               direction.

<b>               INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
               The seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves 
               opening a file cabinet. He takes out an armload of files, 
               carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in. He sits on 
               his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey 
               bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass.

               He has been drinking for some time. He starts stumbling back 
               to the file cabinet. On the way his eye is caught by his 
               degrees hanging on the wall. He stumbles to them, picks them 
               up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in. He 
               goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing. 
               Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the 
               wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so.

               He repeats softly to himself, as a litany, "It doesn't make 
               a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference..." 
               He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still-
               ringing phone off the desk. He pours himself a drink.

               As he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the 
               floor: a MAN'S VOICE. "Frank. Frank. Frank. Goddamnit. Are 
               you there...? Frank..." Galvin pays no attention.

               Drinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of 
               degrees.

               I had to go out. Back at 10. Judge Geary called. Are you 
               available for lunch Wednesday University Club?" A hand takes

               Galvin in the anteroom, dressed in his suit, unshaved, having 
               just signed the paper. He takes a piece of Scotch tape from 
               the dispenser on the desk, picks up a file folder from the 
               coffee table. It is torn in several places and rudely Scotch-
               taped.

               and THREE CUSTOMERS spaced widely, Galvin in his overcoat 
               downing a shot, the file open before him. He is reading.

               He checks his watch, scoops the file together under his arm, 
               throws a dollar on the bar, and heads for the door.

               Galvin walking tentatively down the corridor of a very rundown 
               nursing home. He receives suspicious looks from the 
               Attendants. He is checking numbers on the doors against a

               The door to the ward from the inside. Galvin opening the 
               door to the dark ward, backlit, tentative, a little unsteadied 
               from his drinking. He puts his back against the door, puts 
               down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid 
               camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his 
               paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward. As he walks 
               down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each 
               bed. Galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart.

               The chart held by Galvin. DEBORAH ANN KAYE, various medical 
               notations. He lowers the chart and we SEE in the bed beyond 
               it a shriveled, tiny form stuck with needles and tubes.

               Galvin replaces the chart, puts his file, briefcase, etc. on 
               the foot of the bed, takes a flash photo of the figure in 
               the bed. Takes another one. Puts down camera, sits on the 
               end of the bed gazing at the unseen form. He lights a 
               cigarette, and sits looking at her.

               Galvin, excited, is trying to light the cigar. His hand shakes 
               badly. He has forgotten to bite off the end. He bites it, 
               lights the cigar.

               A shoddy one-and-a-half room bachelor apartment. Galvin,

               on an armchair in the bedroom. A yellow legal pad in his

               He is talking on the phone softly, soothingly.

               neck to loosen it up. Reaches to the table next to his bed 
               for the bottle to pour a drink.

               a very beautiful blonde woman in a silver frame. She is the 
               same woman we saw earlier in the news clip. She is on the 
               deck of a sailboat, laughing. A pile of change on the table, 
               a money clip, a rosary, and the wedding ring in the pile of

                         the reputation of two men, to help a

                         heart stopped. When the heart stops 
                         the brain's deprived of oxygen. You 
                         get brain damage. That is why she's

                         they restored the heartbeat within 
                         three or four minutes. In your opinion

                         longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's

                         have kicked you out on that

                         rushed me into court in five days... 
                         my star witness disappears, I can't 
                         get a continuance, and I don't give 
                         a damn. I'm going up there and I'm 
                         going to try it. Let the Jury decide. 
                         They told me Sweeney he's a hard-
                         ass, he's a defendant's judge. I 
                         don't care. I said, the hell with 
                         it. The hell with it. I'll take my

               been asleep. He replaces phone. He surveys the office.

               Dead, resigned. He closes the phone book. He reaches in a 
               pack of cigarettes on the desk. It is empty. He roots in the 
               ashtray for a long butt. This disgusts him. He rejects it. 
               Rubs his eyes. Gets up. Goes to the window, stares out. Looks 
               back at the scene in his office. It is over.

               He stands by Laura and looks down at her, he looks at Mickey.

               He has let them down. He goes to a cabinet under the lawbooks 
               and takes out a bottle of whiskey and a water glass. He walks 
               into the anteroom. Sighs, sits on the couch near the door. 
               Glances at the several letters that have just fallen through 
               the slot. He pours a half-tumbler full of whiskey, and drains 
               it. He refills the tumbler. He absently picks up the mail 
               and starts mechanically sorting through it. He stops at an

               Two very young children walk across a play area. The door to 
               the play area opens and Joe Galvin, in overcoat, comes in. 
               He looks around the room, starts to walk across it.

               CAMERA PANS WITH him to REVEAL a woman, KATHY, who is 
               comforting a crying child. Galvin walks over to her. Stands 
               a respectful distance away. She sees him watching her, looks 
               up.

               She is traumatized by the question. The casual conversation
