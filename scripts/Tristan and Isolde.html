               Britain the Dark Ages

               The Roman Empire has fallen.

               The land lies in ruins, divided amoung feuding tribes.

               To the west, Ireland has flourished untouched by the Romans, 
               protected by the sea.
<b> 
</b>               Led by their powerful and ruthless King, the Irish have subdued 
               the Britons.
<b> 
</b>               Knowing that if Ireland is to prosper, the tribes must never 
               be allowed to unite.

</b>                         You were right. I do not know if life 
                         is greater than death, but love was 
                         more than either.

<b>

               Where can we find two better hemispheres,

               Without sharp north, without declining west?

               Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;

               If our two loves be one, or thou and I.

               Love so alike, that none can slacken, none can die."

               Their love did not bring down a kingdom. Legend says that Marke 
               defeated the Irish, rebuilt Castle Dor and reigned in peace until 
               the end of his days.

               his grave with two willows that grew forever intertwined... then
