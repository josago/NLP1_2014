    The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-
    year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT
    and is staring intently into a large bank of computer
    screens.

    An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come
    out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down
    a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of
    the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into
    frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and
    several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling
    thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy
    sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his
    early twenties.

<b>                        SETH
</b>              Is that them?

<b>                           PETER
</b>              (nods yes)

<b>                        SETH
</b>              Jesus Christ.

    The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large
    glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as
    almost every person on the floor watches.

                        SETH (cont'd)
              Are they going to do it right there?

<b>                           PETER
</b>              Yeah.

<b>                           SETH
</b>              Fuck me.

    WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.

    The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a
    piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person
    and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one
    HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and
    into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS
    then stops a bit down from them.

<b>                           HEATHER
</b>                 I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

    TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with
    the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP
    MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost
    back into the numbers on his computer screen.

    The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing
    people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer
    screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until
    finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and
    stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off
    his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.

    SAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of the
    trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people.
    Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast
    mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long
    pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture
    straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then
    builds.

<b>                        SAM ROGERS
</b>              You are all still here for a reason...
              Most of this floor was just sent home...
              forever. We have spent the last hour
              saying good-bye... they were good people
              and they were good at their jobs... but
              you all were better. Now they are gone.
              They are not to be thought of again. This
              is your opportunity. On every floor of
              this building and in every office from
              Hong Kong to London the same thing is
              happening. Before this is all done 3 of
              every ten guys who were standing between
              you and your boss's job are now gone.
              That is your opportunity. I've been at
              this place for thirty-four years and let
              me tell you that this will not be the
              last time you go through this. But you
              all are survivors... And that is how this
              firm over 107 years has always continued
              to grow stronger. So hold your heads
              high... and get back to work.

    He looks out at them then turns and heads back into his
    office and closes the door.

    There are other people streaming out the door doing the same

    tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it
    has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and
    can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman,
    SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed
    in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into
    the building. He can't help himself.

     her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his
     personal belongings in it.

     shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns
     and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the

     SETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it
     struggles through traffic up town. SETH reaches into his bag
     and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. Their
     conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be
     listening.

<b>                         SETH
</b>               You want one?

<b>                         PETER
</b>               No.

     PETER gives him a bit of a look.

<b>                         SETH
</b>               What, we got them on our way to meet you
               at the office... we didn't know what the
               fuck you wanted to talk about...
                   (almost to himself)
               ... thought you might've gotten some
               chick pregnant or something.

<b>                         PETER
</b>               I haven't gotten laid in so long that's
               not possible at this point.

<b>                         SETH
</b>               I guess that's true.

     PETER looks out the window at all the people on the street
     enjoying the Thursday night.

<b>                         PETER
</b>               Look at these people.

               ending, and they've got no idea what's
               coming.

     SETH'S demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn't seem to
     project much in the way of stress.

</b>                  I've noticed that about you actually.

</b>                  Whatever, same thing, I made almost a
                  quarter of a million dollars last year...
                  for what... pushing some numbers around
                  on a computer screen, so a bunch of
                  glorified crack addicts could take that
                  information and pretend to understand it,
                  and then make a bet against some other
                  jock half way around the world who if he
                  wasn't doing this would probably be in
                  some OTB somewhere putting it all on
                  number seven. And at the end of the day
                  one guy loses and the other guy wins.

     PETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long
     beat. Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH:

<b>                            PETER
</b>                  You do know it's a little more
                  complicated than that?

     SETH'S phone starts playing a ring tone. He looks down at the
     text.

<b>                            SETH
</b>                  It's Will... He wants to know if we've
                  found him? What do I tell him.

</b>                  Tell him that we haven't found him.

     year old, although carries himself with intense confidence.
     He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees
     roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk

     The whole table looks over at Peter with some awe.

               just changing what you're adding up...
               and if I may speak freely the money is
               considerably more attractive here.

     JARED looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his
     tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even.

     RAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through
     the numbers and takes a beat too long.

     JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to
     RAMESH. She looks back.

     gone. We hear nothing.   It is awkward to say   the least. He

     They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference
     room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with
     people along one side of the table. There are a team of five
     lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board
     members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits
     RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of
     the table is empty.

     They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence...
     waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking
     into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is
     not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head.
     He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however
     tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the

<b>                         PETER
</b>               Yes... Well as you probably know over the
               last 36-40 months the firm has begun
               packaging new MBS products that combine
               several different traunches of rating
               classification in one tradable security.
               This has been very profitable as I
               imagine you noticed.

<b>                          JOHN TULD
</b>               I have.

<b>                         PETER
</b>               Well the firm is currently doing a
               considerable amount of this business
               every day. The problem, which is I guess
               why we are here tonight, is that it takes
               us... the firm... almost a month to layer
               these products correctly thereby posing a
               challenge from a risk management
               standpoint.

<b>                         JOHN TULD
</b>               And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

<b>                         PETER
</b>               We have to hold these assets on our books
               longer than we might ideally like to.

               essentially just mortgages, so that has
               allowed us to push the leverage
               considerably beyond what you might be
               willing, or allowed to do in any other

     Then JOHN TULD spins around quickly with a considerably more
     upbeat tone and looks up and down the table.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               So, now that we know that the music has
               stopped, what can we do about it?

     Long Silence.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I'm afraid this
               is where you are supposed to step back
               in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr.
               Sullivan today.

     JARED and SARAH come to attention and gather their thoughts.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               What have you got for us?

     Long pause.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               What have I told you since the first day
               you walked into my office? (pause) That
               there are three ways to make a living in
               this business... Be first, be smarter, or
               cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even
               though I like to think we have got some
               pretty smart people in this building of
               the two remaining options, it sure is a
               hell of alot easier to just be first.

     The room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the
     window.

     are heard.

     As the question stands unfinished Will's convertible flies
     into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to JARED and WILL.
     The attendant gets out and before WILL has a chance JARED
     hands the attendant a tip. JARED then looks back at WILL who
     is waiting to get in the car.

     SARAH is sitting at her desk staring out the window. She
     calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes
     it. Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass
     wall separating her office from the floor giving herself
     total privacy. She walks over to her desk and sits down. She
     reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically
     preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work.
     She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. Her
     face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give
     way. Again she tries. And again. She can not cry. She can't
     believe it. The deeply tragic look of total failure floods
     her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. Still no
     tears. Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it
     isn't real and she knows it. Then she tries to laugh to
     herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real.
     She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can
     only openly express even to herself... nothing.

               life, and do it well, you need to believe
               that you are necessary. And you are. If

               their big cars and these houses that they
               haven't even paid for. Then you are
               necessary. The only reason they can
               continue to live like kings is because
               we've got our fingers on the scale in
               THEIR favor. And if I were to take my

     As he approaches the building he sees SAM ROGERS standing in
     front having a cigarette. He walks towards him and then

     the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and
     walks over to the sinks. JARED is standing in front of the
     mirror with his shirt off shaving. His new shirt and tie are
     on a hanger next to him. SETH walks up to a sink next to him
     and it is very obvious that he has been crying. He undoes his
     collar and starts to wash his face. Finally JARED speaks.

<b>                            JARED COHEN
</b>                  You alright?

     SETH sends him a dagger of a look through the reflection in
     the mirror.

<b>                            SETH
</b>                  You just fired me.

<b>                            JARED COHEN

<b>                            SETH
</b>                  This is all I've ever wanted to do.

<b>                            JARED COHEN
</b>                  Really?

<b>                            SETH
</b>                  Yes...

     This hits JARED just a touch.

<b>                            JARED COHEN
</b>                  I am sorry.

     JARED does up his tie perfectly looks at SETH again in the
     eye. Then walks out.

     SARAH ROBERTSON is sitting in a club chair staring out the
     window. The coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of

                  pretty bad, I wish I could say that today
                  is going to be less so but that isn't

                  but how bout you read it on your own time

                            SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
                  I have spent the night here meeting with
                  the executive committee and the decision
                  has been made to begin to unwind a
                  considerable portion of the firm's
                  holdings in several key asset classes.
                  The crux of it is... in the firm's
                  thinking the party is over as of this
                  morning. There is going to be
                  considerable turmoil in the markets for
                  the foreseeable future. They believe that
                  it is better to have this turmoil begin
                  with us... as a result the firm has
                  decided to liquidate the majority of its
                  position of fixed income MBS today.

                  You should be getting a breakdown right
                  now, you will see the accounts you are
                  responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't
                  taken you long to understand the
                  implications of this sale on your
                  relationships with your counterparties
                  and as a result on your careers. I have
                  expressed this reality to the executive
                  committee and they understand. As a
                  result, if you are able to complete a 93%
                  sale of your assets you will receive a
                  1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

               For those of you who have never been
               through this before, this is what the
               beginning of a fire sale looks like. I
               don't have to tell any of you that the
               first hour and a half is going to be very
               important. I want you to hit every bite
               you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers,
               and your mother if she's buying...and
               obviously no swaps, its outgoing only
               today. This is obviously not the way any
               of us would like for this to be going
               down, but the ground is shifting below
               our feet, and there appears to be no

     that they indeed know what needs to be done.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               Obviously... this is a very unique
               situation... if we are successful today
               we will have been successful in
               destroying our own jobs... I can not
               promise that each of you will be
               repositioned within the firm, but I can
               tell you that I am very proud of the work
               we have done together here, I have been
               at this here for 34 years, and I know...
               from experience people are going to say
               some nasty stuff about what we have done
               here, and what you have devoted a portion
               of your life to. But have faith that in
               the greater picture our skills have not
               been wasted, we have accomplished much,
               and our talents have served some greater
               good...

               the market must eat its weak, and you
               all... are not the weak. We must strike
               quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause
               on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is
               going to be in here getting in your
               faces, sniffing around, you let us take
               care of them and you just keep going. We
               own what we are choosing to sell today
               and there is nothing they can do about
               it. 107 years ago this firm was founded,
               today we secure our place for next 107.
               You've got two minutes before we get
               started. Let's finish this, so we can get
               on to the next one...

     JOHN TULD climbs down from the table. SAM, who is standing
     off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then
     heads into his office.

     He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes

     There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we
     hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up

     They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually
     a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another
     hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.

                            TULD (cont'd)

                  so yourself. I'm starting to feel a

               show for it. I'm just not quite sure how
               we fucked this thing up so badly.

     This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be
     losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.

<b>                         TULD

               been doing that everyday for almost forty

               We just react... and we get paid well for
               it if we're right... and get left by the
               side of the road if we're wrong. There's
