<b>          EXT. FERRY LANDING - NEW ENGLAND SHORE - DAY
</b>          The sparkling waters. The chirping spring day. We are on an isolated
          stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible
          distantly across the Sound. There is asense of anticipation,
          excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO
          CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however,
          for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and
          -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens -
          - sets the scene.

          island my friend Muffy owns... It's spring break... and she's invited
          us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take
          us there...

          Kit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself. She's got nothing to

          big, good-natured, easygoing WASP jock (rugby and crew); and SKIP, Mr.
          Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless
          upper-crust kid. Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin.

          It was a real lift for me, too, hon.
                         
          A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the
          highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road
          sign indicates: "BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT" in another direction.
                         
          Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan.
                         
          The Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate
          male hitchhiking down the road.

          pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down to the basement.

          MUFFY ST. JOHN drags a woman's body across the floor. The arm comes
          off in her hand.

          Clara comes clopping down the steps. Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm
          still in her hand. Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place
          of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including
          the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust. Early 20's, pretty in
          an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood.

          Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd
          do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses.

          Soon there's the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing behind
          Clara.
          Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining
          clutter. She goes to open a basement window for ventilation. It is a
          ground-level transom, hinged at the top. Through it Clara is visible
          departing the grounds.
                         
          Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING. She turns, hesitating, and follows the
          sounds.

          Part of the basement, an old washroom and more, with tub, slop sink
          and large incinerator. Muffy enters, pulling the chain on the bare,
          overhead bulb. It illuminates the room, and the tub underneath --
          slightly rusty at the drain, but otherwise spotless -- and the slowly
          dripping faucet.

          He's a real hi-tech freak and Ivy League wiseass, a free spirit in
          neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt. He shoulders his lightweight
          videopak again, taping it. Arch and Skip watch with him from the end
          of the pier. But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are
          distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car.

          next to the others in the gravel lot behind the landing office and -
          gets out quickly, dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back seat. She
          is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy, earnest, small-town
          girl, overdressed for the occasion.

          O.S. the shower is turned off. All is quiet.
                         
          Then, very faintly at first, WE HEAR something -- it sounds like
          crying. As it grows gradually louder we realize that it is crying -- a
          baby crying.
                         
          Nan appears suddenly in the bathroom doorway. A towel is wrapped
          around her. She listens.
                         
          The crying is louder now, but muffled -- a baby crying for its mother.
          It seems to come from a large mahogany wardrobe on the other side of
          the room.
                         
          Nan tenses, slowly approaohing, then flinging open the wardrobe door.

          stop.
          Nan rips out the cassette, and sinks back onto the bed, burying her
          head in her hands.

          Rob and Kit are standing together staring INTO CAMERA. REVERSE to see
          the object of their attention. Hanging on the wall in front of them is
          a large oil portrait with the eyes out out. Something is moving behind
          the canvas ­watching them.
                         
          Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an
          inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to
          have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the-
          cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth,
          like a pendulum marking seconds.
                         
<b>          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Rob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning
          it up against the wall.
                         
          CAMERA DOLLIES IN for a CLOSE UP of the portrait. It looks much
          creepier with the now vacant eye sockets.

          They are undressing on opposite sides of the bed. The silence between
          them is thick enough to be cut with a knife. Kit sits down slowly on
          the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on
          his side.
                         
          They sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in
          the middle of the bed.

          He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the
          bathroom comes on. Beat.
                         
          He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in
          and turns off the light...
          ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly
          covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead
          light...
                         
          ...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still
          tries to stifle it.
                         
          Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He
          reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it
          and starts to unscrew the bulb instead.

          Kit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob
          perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into
          darkness.
                         
          Silence.

</b>          Very funny.
                         
          Kit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is
          laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her.

          Undaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to
          listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks
          once softly, and enters.

          The light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also
          locked.
                         
          Arch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door
          for everybody's benefit.

          rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a
          porno movie.
                         
          Carrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle.
          The doorknob comes off in his hand.

          Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown
          weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He
          takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the
          night.
                         
          After a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle
          landing in water with a splash.
                         
<b>          EXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

          Skip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its
          dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in
          the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp.
          Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds,
          finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph.
                         
          Something MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife
          to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind,
          douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse
          entrance to prepare his joint.
                         
<b>          INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

          as Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle
          lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is
          still.
                         
          Skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges
          slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of
          another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing
          sound--completely inhuman.
                         
<b>                         SKIP

          There is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping
          sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring.
                         
<b>                         SKIP

          Pause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade
          clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear.
                         
          Finally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter
          and flicks it on.
                         
          Something snags him from behind.
                         
          Skip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed
          hands tightens around his neck.
                         
          His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor.

          Up on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool
          shed. Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible
          sense of disorder about her. She keeps to herself, turning toward the
          woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand.

          until he sees it too: Skip's body, pale and bloodied, draped within

          on frail, metal springs.

          This is the last of Muffy's little April Fool's gags, and as with the

          The path is narrow and tortuous . Arch uses his club to clear the way,

          The snake coils itself to strike.
                         
          Arch's foot comes down just missing it, less than six inches away,
          when suddenly the ground seems to move. A noose springs up, tightens
          around his ankle, and Arch is lifted into the air upside down,
          swinging wildly, dropping his club.
                         
          Now the viper strikes, and Arch sees it. He is shrieking with horror
          as he tries to bat the creature away from him. But he keeps swinging
          into it, and the snake keeps striking at him, trying to find an
          opening.
                         
          Suddenly a long, gleaming blade ENTERS FRAME and chops the snake in
          two.

          He takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a
          Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them
          splattered with bright red nail polish.

          Kit backs into the hallway. Downstairs O.S. she can hear Rob moving
          about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening.
                         
          She hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps
          inside.

          in blood.
                         
          Kit reaches for the doorknob. It comes off in her hand.

          back in, to get it to work.
                         
          There's a NOISE outside the window. She turns aghast. Suddenly the

          Rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs, Rob suddenly bumps
          into something, someone there. He screams aloud, dropping his
          flashlight.
                         
          It is Harvey. His body dangles from the rafters high above the top of
          the rear stairs, a thick rope around his neck.
                         
          Now Rob has become unnerved, and it is Kit's turn to take the lead.

          The flarelight wanes. Constable Potter looks up anxiously. Soon he
          will be waiting in darkness . (Unlike the previous night's scene, now
          there are no outdoor lights on here.)
                         
<b>          EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Rob and Kit burst out of the dining room as if the house were on fire.
          Kit stops to pull the doors shut behind them.

          Within moments they have crossed the back yard and disappeared into
          the brush leading down to the water.
                         
<b>          EXT. PATHWAYS - NIGHT

          The night is a landscape of terror. As Rob and Kit race through the
          darkness, the forest seems to fold in on top of them, completely
          enclosing them within itself.

          They arrive at the water's edge and slow down abruptly. Though they
          can see Potter's boat rocking gently in the water, moored to the dock,
          they cannot make out any sign of the Constable.

          No answer. The silence is chilling. They proceed out onto the dock.

          Rob unlashes the mooring, grabbing hold of the line to pull the boat
          in. It won't budge, the line snagged in the water where it dips in.
          Rob tugs harder, freeing something to the surface.

          It is Constable Potter, his body turning once before sinking again
          under its tethered weights.
          An animal cries out behind them. Rob wastes no more time, pulling the
          rope and the boat quickly toward them. They jump in.
                         
          There is a flashlight in the toolbox. Rob grabs it, shining it onto
          the controls. But there's no key in the ignition, and no other way to
          start it.

          Rob and Kit move up to the shrubbery skirting the back lawn and gaze
          across at the house. It is completely dark within and remains wrapped
          in silence as before.

</b>          Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed.
                         
          Sure enough, the doors they come out by minutes ago, the ones they
          didn't stop to close, are now shut tight.

          They move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the
          house. They stop.
                         
<b>                         ROB
</b>          There.
          He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot
          space of clear lawn.

          Kit swallows hard.
                         
          She nods.

          They break from their cover and run, keeping low, to the side of the
          house. Rob peers through the window into the darkness inside , pushes
          the transom all the way open, and then drags himself through on his
          belly.

          He drops to the floor, turning to give Kit a hand. She enters the
          same, dusting herself off next to him. Rob turns on the flashlight,
          using it cautiously.

          The flashlight cuts through the dark, revealing the tap DRIPPING in
          the tub.
                         
          Before, the tub was clean. NOW, however, stubborn crimson STAINS smear
          the basin, like blood that has refused to be washed away. Other stains
          darken the floor.

          The trail leads out of the utility room to the large, cast-iron

          They advance together on the painting, Rob keeping his flashlight on

          from the wall and drops it, jumping back... just as MUFFY'S HEAD rolls
          forward from a shelf behind the painting, right into Kit's lap!
                         
          Kit screams as she bobbles the head in her hands like a hot potato,
          trying to get rid of it.

          kitchen door. Though the door in locked, there's no bolt or chain to
          fully secure it. The knob RATTLES furiously under Buffy's grip, the

          here.

</b>          I'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can
          draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's

          The screen door opens, and Rob steps out onto the porch. He comes over
          to them, but does not butt into their conversation, and Uncle Frank
          just keeps going as if Rob weren't even there.
                         
          UNCLE FRANK (cont.)
          His conduct and his academic performance remain inexcusable. He knows
          your father can't be expected to entrust him with anything until he
          shows some signs of responsibility and initiative.

          The van and the old pickup are idling out front. Uncle Frank is
          honking on the van horn.

          Cal is alone behind the wheel of the pickup.
                         
          Skip walks casually up to the van, then pointedly turns away and heads
          over to the pickup instead. Uncle Frank scowls.

          Nikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey. They say their quick
          farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles.
                         
          Harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs
          aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her. He knows. Finally
          Nan comes out of the house. With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on
          toward the van when...

</b>          And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is
          done.
<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank
          you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false.
          So I'll just say goodbye.
          (beat; an afterthought)
          Thanks for showing me your house.
                         
          She turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard. The others callout
          their last goodbyes. Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy
          turns and walks forlornly back into her house.

          He moves on. Others are passing them now. Chaz stops and wags his

          Muffy stand, overlooking the mess. Not knowing exactly where to
          begin, she starts emptying ashtrays into each other, then just stops.
                         
          She walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly

          closer now we can see what's happening on board... Rob and Skip lean
          against the rail and talk quietly. Kit and Arch and Buck sit together
          and chat... Chaz sits alone, and Nikki sits apart from him, also
          alone.
                         
          Nan is up front, gazing out over the bow, while Harvey stands beside
          her trying to make conversation. Finally, he gives up and strolls to
          the back of the craft, pointedly passing Nikki.
                         
          He alights next to Uncle Frank, who has his briefcase open on his lap.

<b>                         KIT

          Don't you touch him!!

</b>          Muffy, it's not a game anymore!
                         
          Just then there is a loud CRASH o.s. of glass breaking down on the
          first floor. After the slightest pause there is another crash o.s.,
          and another...
                         
          Someone is smashing in all the bay windows along the back porch. Nikki
          screams.
                         
<b>                         MUFFY

          And she runs back down the attic stairs, followed quickly by the
          others.
                         
<b>          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
</b>                         
          as Muffy bursts out of the stairway and into the hall. Then
          Kit.
                         
          Suddenly the door to the stairwell slams shut on Nikki and Chaz
          cutting them off. A key turns in the lock. Muffy and Kit turn back to
          see a male figure in the darkness who'd been hiding behind the door.
                         
          Kit is nearest to him, and without warning, he lunges at her and
          buries a knife into her stomach ·up to the handle.
                         
          Kit screams and chokes, trying to fight him off: but he stabs her
          again, and again and again, plunging the knife deep into her with
          every thrust.
                         
<b>                         KIT
</b>          Muffy! Stop him! Help! He's killing me! Oh, God! He's killing me!
                         
          Muffy, initially paralyzed with fear, now runs for her life, down the
          hallway, down the stairs...
                         
<b>          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
</b>                         
          ...and to the front door as Kit's screams O.S. fade to silence. Muffy
          yanks on the door handle, but the door will not open. She pulls again
          and again desperately, but it won't budge,
          She turns and runs out of the entry hall. Just as she CLEARS FRAME,
          the front door swings silently open...
                         
<b>          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
</b>                         
          Muffy is racing past the back stairs toward the kitchen when A HAND
          reaches out from the pantry and hooks her around the face.
                         
          She is pulled backward, screaming, through the swinging door into the
          darkened pantry.

          It is Skip!
                         
          He pulls her head back, exposing her throat. He raises a knife to it,
          still stained with Kit's blood.
                         
<b>                         SKIP

</b>          Skip! No! ! !
                         
          He makes a move to slit her throat, when Muffy kicks open
          the swinging door and sees...

          ...standing on the other side, smiling, in various states of fake
          blood and mess... Rob, Kit, Nikki, Chaz and Nan. Muffy's eyes pop out.
          Skip's hands relax. And the others burst out laughing.
