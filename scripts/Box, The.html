          A BEDSIDE LAMP is turned on.

          NORMA LEWIS ( 31) sits up in bed. The soft glow of the lamp
           casts her in silhouette. Her husband, ARTHUR LEWIS (30), lies
          next to her.

          Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe.
          Arthur sits up, hair sticking up in every direction. He has
          sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers.

          Norma comes down the stairs and approaches the front door.
          She looks through the PEEPHOLE.
          Through the PEEPHOLE... she glimpses a BLACK SEDAN idling in
          the street. It quickly drives off.
          Norma unlatches the DEAD BOLT and opens the door. She notices
          something at her feet.

          She leans down and picks up the box, noticing that it has
          been meticulously sealed with clear tape. There are no
          markings on it whatsoever.
          Norma looks down the quiet, empty street. She quickly closes
          the door and turns inside and away from the cold air.
          Arthur arrives at the bottom of the stairs.

          Their young son, WALTER LEWIS ( 9), is standing at the top of
          the stairs. He is dressed in his pajamas.
          His parents just stare back at him in silence.

          The Lewis family has now moved into the kitchen. WRAPPING
          PAPER and CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS are scattered across the table.
          Norma is pouring COFFEE. Arthur is cutting through the tape
          that seals the box with a knife while Walter looks on
          eagerly.

<b>                         WALTER

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>          Maybe... it's up to you.
          Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS
          inside. He digs down and retrieves a WOODEN BOX. Its
          dimensions are 8" x 8" x 8".

          top is a CLEAR GLASS DOME attached to a lid with a HINGE
          MOUNT. Inside of the dome is a CYLINDRICAL METAL BUTTON.

<b>                         NORMA
</b>          Is there a note?
          Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE
          ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name:

</b>
<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>          It's for you, Norma.
          Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white
          stationary.
          Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence:

<b>          MR. STEWARD WILL CALL UPON YOU AT 5:00 PM.

          Arthur yawns.

          Arthur is now showered and shaven, dressed for work. He and
          Walter sit at the kitchen table, waiting for Norma to deliver
          breakfast.
          The box sits on the table between them.

          scarf that covers the lower part of her face.

<b>                         DANA

          to a stop.

          Norma gives him a big HUG and a KISS right as the bus doors
          open. A bunch of OLDER KIDS stare out the window... scowling
          at him.
          Walter pushes away from her and stomps up onto the bus...
          mortified. Dana follows him.

          Dana gets on the bus. BUD WALL (30s), the bus driver, smiles
          at Norma. He is an enormous giant of a man with a shaved
          head.

          surface... what can you now tell us
          about the tests you've been
          conducting? Is there any sign of
          life on the red planet?

          Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release
          and Gas Exchange. The first two
          tests, based on soil samples about
          22 centimeters deep, came back
          negative... and the third is...

          Laughter from the press.

</b>          Well... there is a possibility that
          the planet abounds with chemical
          compounds produced by living
          systems. Their chemical nature,
          distribution and structural
          uniqueness could be used to argue
          the presence of microscopic living
          organisms on Mars.
          As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the
          reporter on the shoulder.

          Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity
          of the site where VIKING II landed.
          There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.

<b>                         ARTHUR (CONT-D)

          in the image one line at a time...

<b>                         WALTER
</b>          Because the camera takes five
          minutes to scan in 360 degrees, he
          waited until the camera passed over
          him then jumped ahead in the
          circle.
          The CAMERA moves in closer to the photograph... to the THIRD
          VERSION of ARTHUR LEWIS.

          ever walked the face of the earth.
          The CAMERA ZOOMS in close to Arthur's face... then tips down
          to another MAN kneeling on the pavement directly below him.

          Two POLICE CARS pull up with their SIRENS blaring in front of
          a TOWNHOUSE on Cary Street. TWO POLICE OFFICERS emerge from
          each car and approach the front of the townhouse.
          They begin to bang loudly on the door. A FEMALE NEIGHBOR
          (20s) emerges from the townhouse next door.

<b>                         NEIGHBOR
</b>

</b>          I heard a gunshot... then he ran
          out the front door and got in his
          car.
          The POLICE OFFICER looks at his partner and then proceeds to
          KICK DOWN the door.

           The OFFICERS move through the townhouse with their GUNS
           drawn. The SCREAMING of a YOUNG GIRL can be heard from
          upstairs.

<b>          INT. 1500 CARY STREET -- KITCHEN -- NEXT
</b>
           The OFFICERS enter the kitchen. A WOMAN (20s) named AMY
           BEVILACQUA is slumped over on the kitchen floor in a pool of
          blood.
           The CAMERA moves in toward her face.

           An OFFICER approaches the BATHROOM DOOR at the end of the
          hall. The screaming girl from inside is bawling her eyes out.
          The Officer sees a tiny HAND emerge from underneath the door.
          She is reaching out for help. He goes to open the door, but
          there is a LARGE DEAD BOLT LOCK mounted on the outside.

          Norma and Arthur move toward the front door. Norma puts her
          eye to the PEEPHOLE. Arlington's disfigured face stares back
          at her.
          She opens the door. Arlington stands there smiling...
          briefcase in hand.

          Arlington then opens the BRIEFCASE and shows it to them.
          Inside... the bills are stacked neatly in rows.

</b>          Thanks... we trust your word.
          Arlington offers him a broad smile.

<b>                         ARLINGTON

          They follow Arlington out onto the front walk as he
          approaches his car. The engine is idling... and someone else
          is behind the wheel... but through the tinted windows it is
          unclear who is driving.

          The CAMERA pans around to reveal Arthur... walking slowly
          down the corridor.
          Arlington opens a DOOR at the end of the corridor and leads
          Arthur into a DRAWING ROOM... recreated from Sartre's play.

          Renaissance art and the floor is marble.
          NORMA and WALTER have now been admitted to the drawing room.
          Norma is dressed in an elegant BLACK GOWN. Walter wears a
          tuxedo that looks to be nearly identical to the one his
          father is wearing... and THERE IS A SILK BLINDFOLD WRAPPED
          AROUND HIS HEAD. He wanders around the room... lost...
          The dimensions of the room are equal in every way. It is a
          perfect three-dimensional box.
          Arthur then looks to his wife. He notices that her EYELIDS
          are now gone. Arthur then turns to his son.
          Walter reaches out into the air... seemingly unaware that
          they are in, the room with him.

          In his lap is a file. He is thumbing through a series of
          photographs of the MARS SURFACE. He then arrives at a stack

          floor of his son's bedroom. It is the MARS COMIC BOOK.
          He picks it up and stares at the dark figure looming on the

          STROBES OF WHITE LIGHT begin flicker from beneath the

          massive LAWN south of the entrance. During the holidays it is
          filled with CHRISTMAS TREES for sale, and dozens of ARTS &
          CRAFTS BOOTHS assembled in rows.
          The CAMERA moves through the crowd to find Norma posing for
          photos with her fellow bridesmaids out in front of the
          square.
          ACROSS THE SQUARE... Bud Wall lurks within the rows of
          Christmas Trees. He spies Arthur and Walter mingling with his
          parents and Senator Powell, who has TWO SECRET SERVICEMEN
          standing close by.

          The CAMERA approaches the driveway of the VIRGINIA HOUSE...
          which is positioned at the south end of Forest Lawn square.
          Wedding guests are arriving in droves.
          The house is a large GOTHIC MANSION that is often rented out
          for public events... and in this case... for the lavish
          WEDDING RECEPTION of Deborah Burns and Edward Powell.

</b>
          Arthur and Norma move through the courtyard into the wedding
          reception area... which flows through several TENTS that have
          been erected with HEAT LAMPS and tables covered in WHITE
          TABLECLOTHS and FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS.
          Arthur carries the copy of No Exit with him.

</b>          The play tells the story of uhree
          people, condemned to hell. They are
          to remain in a second empire
          drawing room for all of eternity.
          He closes the book... his mind dissecting what he has just
          read.

<b>                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
</b>          They soon discover that their
          eyelids are missing... and for all
          eternity they will be unable to
          sleep.
          Norma remembers most of the play from high school.

<b>                         NORMA
</b>          There are no mirrors... so they
          will never be able to see their own

</b>          This is Sartre's vision of hell.

<b>                         NORMA
</b>          Because Hell... is other people.
          The look into one another's eyes... Norma sees a WAITER pass
          by with a tray of CHAMPAGNE. They both take a glass.
          Jim crosses the lawn to greet them.

<b>                         JIM
</b>          Arthur... can I speak with you
          privately for a moment?

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>          Sure.
          Arthur walks away with Jim toward the edge of a PATIO that
          overlooks the whole party.

          Jim and Arthur stand at a table. Jim has several PHOTOGRAPHS
          laid out on the table. They are mostly family photos taken
          from the house of Robert Bevilacqua.

          Arthur takes a deep breath. He isn't feeling well.

          Norma looks across the lawn to the table where Arthur is
          seated, next to Walter and their parents.

          There is laughter from the crowd. Deborah blushes... leaning
          her head on her new husband's shoulder.

          No response... just his head... slamming against the door
          repeatedly.

</b>          Norma begins to pound back on the door with her fist... and
          eventually the thumping stops. She begins to hear quiet sobs
          from inside the bathroom.

<b>                         WALTER
</b>          Who's there? Who's there?
          Norma rises to her feet.

<b>                         NORMA

          She takes his left hand... as he clutches Walter's hand in
          his right.

          SUZANNE WELLER (30s) sits on her bed. Her husband KENNETH
          WELLER (30s) stands at the window. Neither looks like they
          have slept in a while.
          Suzanne has the box sitting on the mattress in front of
          her... the glass dome is open.

<b>                         SUZANNE

</b>
          Arthur and Norma stand across from one another in the
          kitchen. Arthur holds the GUN in his right hand... and he
          slowly limps over to his wife and takes her into his arms.

<b>                         ARTHUR

          He looks out through the window at his back yard... likely
          for the last time.

          Suzanne Weller smiles at her husband... reaches her finger
          out and places it on the button.
          She then presses down.

          against the door...

</b>          It's going to be harder for you to

          Arthur closes his eyes... the noise is excruciating. There is
          no time to wait any longer.

<b>                         ARTHUR

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Let's get on with it.
          Arthur kisses her... then steps back... still clutching her
          hand... raises the gun... and fires off a round into her
          heart.
          Norma collapses... Arthur falls with her... breaking her fall
          with his arms as they collapse into a heap onto the linoleum
          floor.

          Suzanne looks over at her husband and lets out a deranged
          giggle. He smiles back.

<b>          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT
</b>
          Arthur looks down into his wife's eyes as the life drains
          from her body. Seconds later... Norma is dead.

          the linoleum. Arthur is now covered in it.

</b>
          Walter crawls across the blood-soaked kitchen floor and
          reaches up to the PHONE that is mounted on the wall. He takes
          his finger and places it in the cradle... dials 911.

          The CAMERA tracks along a series of CUBICLES at the POLICE
          STATION in downtown Richmond. An OPERATOR sits at each
          cubicle... each one female.

          The CAMERA moves in closer...

<b>          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT
</b>
          Arthur has the phone to his ear... imprints of his wife's
          blood are smeared on the phone's receiver.

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>          Yes. This is Arthur Lewis at 1560
          Monument Avenue. I've just shot my
          wife... can you please send an
          ambulance?
          The Operator begins to ask more questions... but Arthur does
          not listen. He hangs up the phone.
          The thumping from upstairs has now subsided.

<b>                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)

</b>          He pulls himself to his feet and heads into the foyer.

          Arthur rounds the corner at the base of the stairs...

          Arthur rounds the corner of the upstairs hallway... rushes
          toward the bathroom door.
          Walter's hand comes sliding out from beneath the crack in the
          door. Arthur grabs it.

<b>                         ARTHUR

          Out of the corner of his eye, Arthur notices something at the
          top of the stairs. It is a POLICE OFFICER. He has his gun
          aimed at Arthur.

<b>                         POLICE OFFICER

          Arthur stares at the officer... frozen... the repercussions
          of his decision now stare him in the face with a loaded gun.

          onto his stomach... handcuffing his wrists together.

          police.

          Arthur is now being escorted by two POLICE OFFICERS to a
          waiting CRUISER that is parked in front of the house.
          Jim Burns is standing there with the door open.

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>          I'm sorry, Jim.
          He stares Arthur down as he is put into the back seat of the
          cruiser. Jim closes the door and goes around to the front of
          the car.
          Jim gets behind the wheel and starts the engine.
          Arthur looks back through the window, toward his house.
          Upstairs in the MASTER BEDROOM WINDOW... Walter is watching,
          tears streaming down his face.
          Arthur reaches up with his hands... cuffed together... and
          tries his best to wave at his son.
