<b>          LEOPOLD (V.0.)
</b>          And we're good to go.
          TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts,
          walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean.
          Adjust their EARPIECES.

<b>          LEOPOLD (V.0.)
</b>          Proceed to first checkpoint and hold.
          They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto

          AGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD
          watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike.

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          Okay sit tight. Company's coming.
          THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like
          barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're
          protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW --

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          Shit. Hang on.
          Leopold scans, looking for them. Searching, until he FINDS --

</b>
<b>                         WHOA --
</b>          The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that. The SEE the Barracudas,
          getting nearer; steal a look at the roof...

<b>          POV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE
</b>          rinses off at an outdoor shower. Beads of spray skip off
          her like diamonds in the sunlight.

</b>          Oh, mama.
          She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve.

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          She sure is taking her time...

<b>                         STEARNS
</b>          She must be really salty...

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          (shakes his head)
          It's not just the salt. She's got
          sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on
          that, and it sticks...
          (then still watching)
          Hell, one time I was in Hawaii? And
          these three models --

          Hawaii.

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          -- Shit!
          He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the
          Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot --

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something
          like this ever happened to you?
          (bends down to pet

<b>                         THE CHIHUAHUA)
</b>          Because if you're a guy - or if you
          know someone who is - then what you've
          just seen should look pretty familiar.
          He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Scientists call this condition "Lust
          Induced Brain Freeze." It affects
          millions of guys, every day, in all
          walks of life -- causing anything
          from a mild embarrassment, to an
          international incident.
          He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS
          pointing GUNS at him.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Hey. I didn't even know it was a
          dog.
          They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Notice I didn't say it's a condition
          that affects men every day -- only
          guys. And that subtle but important
          difference is one of the things this
          movie is about.

          A HUSBAND and his WIFE. He has suitcases by the front door.

</b>          You'll never get away with this.
          I'll sue you down to your last penny.

<b>                         HUSBAND
</b>          Good luck - I transferred everything
          we own into private accounts, where
          you can't touch it. In fact, as of
          now, you're broke.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          But...why?

<b>                         HUSBAND
</b>          I've fallen in love with another
          woman. A younger woman. Prettier,
          with no cellulite. Actually, I think
          you'd like her.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          You bastard.
          The IMAGE FREEZES. Dave walks into the room.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Now clearly, this woman is dealing
          with a Man.

          A DIFFERENT HUSBAND sits across from his WIFE. Above and
          behind her is a TV with SportsCenter on.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          I just want you to know, I've thought
          about this a lot.

</b>
<b>                         (NODS)
</b>          Good.
          She looks down; stirs her soda.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          So there's nothing left to do now,
          but leave you, forever, and only see
          you from across a shiny conference
          table with bloodthirsty lawyers all
          around it.

<b>                         GUY HUSBAND

          (then watching him)
          Well then I guess this is it.
          She pushes back from the table, starts off.

          trade Lupenza?
          (then to the BARTENDER)
          What's the matter with these people?

<b>                         BARTENDER

          o'clock.

          He takes out his cell phone. She levels a look.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          Maybe you should call your lawyer
          too.

</b>          Well when I met him, I didn't know
          so much. About guys, or men or what
          have you -- we just didn't talk about
          such things then. In fact, I didn't
          see him naked until quite well into
          our marriage. When was it Albert?

</b>          A year ago. By accident.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Anyway. I thought I was marrying a
          man, but didn't know that in his
          heart, he was a guy.

<b>          DAVE (O.S.)
</b>          When did you first suspect?

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Not long after the wedding. But it
          didn't bother me. I just didn't
          know how to recognize the signs.
          But we've learned to live with it.
          Haven't we, Albert?
          (then after a beat)
          Albert.

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>          It's twelve hundred and thirty-one
          miles from this spot right here, to
          Cleveland.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          What does that have to do with
          anything?
          He holds up the device - handheld GPS.

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>          Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Who cares how far we are from Atlanta?

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>          You have a cousin there.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Albert. There's a person here asking
          us questions. There's a film crew
          here.
          He looks up at the CAMERA, as if just noticing someone there.
          Then holding up the GPS --

</b>          Like a lot of big cities, Miami is
          known for its sizeable population of

<b>                         SECRETARY
</b>          Let me put it this way. Everyone I
          ever dated was a male. I mean they
          were all men. But only some of them
          were guys. You know?

</b>          (thinks about it)
          -- The guys were funnier. But the
          men were more responsible. You could
          almost half-believe them when they
          told you something sometimes.

<b>          DAVE (O.S.)

          it's fairly easy to develop a long

          a guy named Rufino Lupenza to the

          and cash. I grant you it was a rotten

<b>          LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST
</b>          One has to understand that the act
          of emptying one's bladder goes deep
          to the very roots of masculinity.
          It is an important territorial
          statement that males are genetically
          programmed to carry out.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          I see.

<b>          LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST
</b>          In fact, many of my colleagues believe
          the reason that dogs howl at the
          moon is because they can't go up
          there and urinate on it -- which is
          not, however, a theory which I
          embrace. But guess who gets all the
          grant money every year. The
          bastards...
          He stares off into space. A bitter man.

</b>          I didn't want this job. Twenty years,
          in the social sciences? And what
          was everybody else doing -- they
          were getting laid. They were going
          to bed with women. And what have I

</b>          John, you heard what our leading
          expert said about this particular
          anxiety that guys have regarding
          bathrooms in general and public ones
          in particular. Any thoughts?

</b>          Well he's exactly right, Dave. I
          mean the guy was a little loopy but
          he hit the nail on the head.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          So an airport bathroom presents a
          specific kind of challenge.

</b>          The worst kind, Dave, and in a lotta
          ways. Because a guy's main goal is
          to get in and outta there without
          having to deal in any other way with
          any other guy - and in an airport
          bathroom especially, with the turnover

          some pretty mean odds.

          come in, he's gonna see the open

          to grab a spot against the wall.

          guy feel he needs to get out of this.

<b>                         JOHN MADDEN
</b>          Well the crucial thing here, is makin'
          sure there's no eye contact. I mean
          none - zero. These guys'll look up,
          they'll look down, they'll look
          straight ahead -- but a guy would
          rather have you poke both his eyes
          out with burning hot fire tongs,
          Dave, than to give the next guy over
          a reason to think you might be lookin'
          at him in a public bathroom. For
          reasons that oughtta be pretty darn
          obvious.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy
          Number Two --
          The SECOND GUY comes in; John diagrams the call.

<b>                         JOHN MADDEN
</b>          Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna
          do is, he's gonna come in, see the
          first guy in position along the wall
          and right away he's gonna line up
          wide on the opposite side. This is
          a best case scenario here, something
          both these guys can appreciate.
          Plus they've opened up the middle
          for the third guy --
          The THIRD GUY comes in. John diagrams his path to the middle
          urinal. The Guy goes there.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          What about eye contact in this
          situation.

<b>                         JOHN MADDEN
</b>          Well you're still not likely to
          encounter any, but again if you do,
          that's what that buffer zone on either
          side of him's for. And all three of
          'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have
          it, I can tell you that.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Okay. Now if things stay like this...

          fine - and if this were some small
          commuter airport, y'know late at
          night or somethin', then these guys
          could possibly even be home free.
          But we're talkin' Miami International
          here, this is the big time, we're

          four hundred people at a clip. So
          everybody's gonna be next to somebody,
          which is the last thing any of these
          guys want. You're in a critical

<b>                         DAVE

          Here he comes --

          Well, the baseball thing. I mean a
          while ago I was into that - big time.
          You know, fooling around with
          different lineups, mixing up the
          batting order - like thinking about
          what would happen if you took your
          cleanup guy and made him eighth or

          shuffling my pitching staff around,

          and sign at the winter meetings.
