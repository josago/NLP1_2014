          Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our
          planet is mythical and majestic.
                         
          The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in
          the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white
          clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep
          blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow
          and brown.
                         
          It is noon in Cape Town and early night in India.
                         
          The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened
          sliver on its Eastern edge.
          It is beautiful! And so full of life.
                         
          But not here.
                         
          Here it is completely silent.

          A small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth.
          If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is
          far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is-
                         
          The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS).
                         
          It resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like
          wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules.
                         
          It floats with a sense of proud achievement.
                         
          It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at
          an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps
          around the Earth per day.
                         
          It is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of
          Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia
          and Ethiopia.
                         
          Soon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes
          smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright
          spec grazing over the blue atmosphere.

           '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every
           time I passed over Texas, I'd look
           down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky,
           was looking up, thinking of me. Six
           weeks I'm blowing kisses to that
           woman. Then we land at Edwards and I
           find out she'd run off with a lawyer
           before I was off the launch pad, so I
           packed my car and I headed to...

          THE MOON is rising over the Pacific Ocean.

          Ryan is paralyzed, holding onto Matt tightly and looking at him
          in fright. He stares back.

          He runs the other end of the tether to the harness on Ryan's
          suit and attaches it.

          Matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a gentle
          nudge. Drifting again she begins to freak.

          The tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from Matt.
                         
          Matt ignites the thrusters, tugging Ryan behind him. But this
          proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him, changing
          his direction.
                         
<b>                          MATT
</b>           See? Where you go, I go.
                         
          Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position. As he does
          so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again.
                         
<b>                          MATT (CONT'D)
</b>           Better. Let's get out of here.
          Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and,
          igniting a long thrust, he jets away.
                         
          Ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and SHE SCREAMS-

          Matt changes direction and approaches Shariff. He has to ignite
          several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting
          against Ryan's momentum.

          Shariff's body is tethered to a PANEL that was ripped away from
          the Explorer. Matt approaches the panel and ignites the
          thrusters to slow down his course, and-
                         
          He grabs onto it. Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against
          Shariff's body. The contact slows her trajectory, but it throws
          Shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him.

          Matt, holding on to the metal, spins with it. He detaches
          Shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself.
                         
          He lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster,
          pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring
          Ryan and Shariff closer together.

          Matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the
          Shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two
          bodies pulls him in all directions.

          Tentatively Ryan extends her right hand to grab onto Shariff's
          body harness. And she sees-
                         
          Shariff's broken helmet. A hole the size of a soft ball pierces
          through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess.
          Ryan's face is inscrutable. Finally she looks away, but this
          time something arrests her gaze:
                         
          A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff, tethered to his
          suit via a small chain. In it, a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with abandon,
          happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG
          ARMS. Transfixed, Ryan is unable to look away, something
          complicated confusing her eyes.
                         
          The photograph floats in the empty space above Planet Earth.

          The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage. The tail is beyond
          repair, one wing is completely destroyed, while the other
          waffles weakly, nearly sheared from the fuselage.

          Matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps
          against the windshield of the COCKPIT.
                         
          At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose
          of the Shuttle, losing her grip on Shariff.
                         
          As she caroms off, she grabs onto what is left of the cockpit's
          window.

          lighting the cockpit.

          At the end of the cabin, among the floating objects, a lifeless
          body drifts among the wreckage. Ryan regards it silently,
          mesmerized.

          He gently pushes her into space. She slowly drifts away from the
          Explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether.
                         
          Matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small
          thrusts, he combats Ryan's swing. And with a LONGER THRUST-
                         
          He shoots forward, pulling Ryan behind him.
                         
          The two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the
          shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble.

          The surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels

          THE SECOND SOYUZ becomes visible, attached to the Station's

          Matt triggers his THRUSTER, turning sharply. Ryan's trajectory
          carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses,
          breaking Matt's direction.
          He fires again to counter her momentum.
                         
          A VERY LONG THRUST sends both of them in the right direction,
          straight down toward the Station, but at great speed.
                         
          The Station is getting very close, and they're going very fast.
                         
          Matt ignites the FRONTAL THRUSTER, which begins to slow him
          down, but the thrust stops.
                         
          Ryan, following her own momentum, begins to pass Matt.

          Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to
          grab hold. As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms.
                         
          Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station.
          As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing.
                         
          Ryan passes flying above him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt.
          The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing.
                         
          Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab
          hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but
          she's floating too high.
                         
          She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one
          handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the
          black void.

          Matt is floating straight toward her and-
          He COLLIDES against her. For a moment they are face to face,
          only the glass of their headgear separates their faces.
                         
          But she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her
          into the emptiness.
                         
          Her drifting is intercepted by a Solar Panel. She crashes
          against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it.
                         
          Ryan bounces down towards the Earth, tensing the tether, pulling
          Matt, making him descend over the other side of the panel.
                         
          The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two.

          alarm ringing out across the Station.
                         
          Orange is turning to green. Her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen
          and her breath becomes more even. Her body floats, relaxed in
          the confined space of the airlock.

          Ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove.
                         
          And then the other.
                         
          Desperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist. She
          squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half.
                         
          Then she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if
          shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the
          claustrophobia of the suit.
                         
          Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt, she floats in mid-air,
          relieved and exhausted. The hum of the Space Station surrounds
          her.
                         
          Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them
          in her arms, floating in a fetal position.
          For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber,
          surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in
          the cabin's womb.

          The International Space Station, with its modules, its torn
          solar panels, and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out
          from its center, is dwarfed against Earth's orb and the infinite
          universe stretching out beyond.
                         
          The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the
          grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below.
                         
          Everything is still.

          Ryan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal cabinet

          one end. She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it.
                         
          She DRINKS in long gulps, squeezing the bottle, trying to quench
          her thirst. DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water overflows.

          Ryan manages to unhook the rope, freeing the Soyuz from the
          collapsing Space Station.
                         
          She braces herself against the vessel, as she sees-

          The Soyuz' Solar Panel collides with the Station's, shattering
          into smaller pieces of debris that almost hit Ryan.
                         
          The Soyuz spins away as-

          Ryan watches as a succession of satellite fragments pepper the
          slowly revolving Station segments. As the segments crumble,
          colliding with additional debris, the fragments glimmer
          magnificently then join...
                         
          ...the THINNING TIDE OF DEBRIS orbiting toward the dark side of

          remains fixed on the vast nothingness--for no good reason--but
          nevertheless FIXED on something.

          Ryan begins to HOWL, giving in to the mad joy of it all.
          Moments later, through the RADIO, she is joined by a CHORUS of
          CANINES--Aningang's DOGS--TUNING INTO HER VOICE in a mad, crazy
          harmonic cacophony. Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling with
          abandon.

          TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear as crystals, spilling from her

          They float away, like tiny satellites orbiting her face.
                         
          Aningang can be heard intermittently, YELLING, as if trying to
          silence the dogs. Then the dogs, one by one, cease their wailing
          and Ryan is left with nothing but her own voice.
                         
          She stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue
          light.
