<b>          EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY
</b>
          Sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. A
          strong wind bends them back, showing their light green
          bellies.

          This is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane
          tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to
          be more rural than suburb.

          CURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked
          on the sky, narrow as he stares at...

          A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him.
          It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and
          gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending
          wispy tentacles toward the ground.

          Curtis stands, awestruck.

          The clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake
          his position. A light rain begins.

          The rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his
          cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder
          now. He notices something strange.

          The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his
          shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his
          palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools.

          He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an
          amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil.

          Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now.
          Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends
          back the trunk of the maple tree.

          Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
          Curtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle. Cool,
          clean water rushes over his face.

                         

<b>          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
          SAMANTHA(29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan.
          She's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized T-
          shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them.
          HANNAH(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of
          toast and feeding it to the dog.

<b>           2.
</b>
                         
          Hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid
          wrapped over her right ear. It clips into her hair near the
          back of her head. The dog's name is Red, a Rhodesian
          Ridgeback that appreciates the attention.
          Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head. In
          the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand
          and sets it on her plate.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           (takes a seat)
           No, no, no...Don't feed the dog
           darlin'.
          Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds
          it to the dog. Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs
          out on everyone's plates.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Thanks babe.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           You slept late.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Yeah. I need to go. What you got
           going today?

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           I've got to finish up some curtains
           for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are
           coming over.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>
<b>                          (MOUTH FULL)
</b>           With the kids?

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Yeah. Cammie said she just needed
           to get out of the house.
          Samantha takes her seat at the table.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Tell Nat to take it easy on her.
          Curtis gets up and goes to Hannah.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Cam can hold her own. We need to
           send in the deposit for the beach
           condo.
          He kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to
          make eye contact. She looks over at him. He speaks using
          sign language. Three broad, slow gestures.

<b>           3.

</b>           I love you.
          Hannah puts her arms around his neck and he squeezes her. He
          stands and grabs a sack lunch off the counter. On his way
          out, he kisses Samantha on top of the head.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Just write the check, babe. Okay.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Okay. Bye.
          Samantha sips her coffee as Hannah feeds more toast to the
          dog.

<b>                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>           (as she signs)
           No more food. You, eat.

                         

<b>          EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY
</b>
          Curtis shoulders his way out the front screen door. Keys in
          his mouth and sack lunch in his hand, he makes his way down
          the porch steps and onto the front walk.
          He pops open the chain-link gate and heads for the PICK-UP
          parked on the street. Clear blue sky overhead.

                         

<b>          EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY
</b>
          Small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun. A slight
          breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is
          drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling.
          A spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the
          ground. Curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the
          drill's cabling system and yanks down.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Yeah, let's keep going with that
           bit! It'll go another 10 feet!
          He yells to DEWART(36), a big guy sitting at the controls of
          a diesel powered WELL-DRILLING RIG. The truck has a long
          rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised HIGH on its back.

<b>                          DEWART
</b>           We won't get the gravel pack down
           today!

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Why not?!

<b>           4.
</b>
                         

<b>                          DEWART
</b>           Those clouds! We're gonna have to
           call it!
          Curtis looks back to a potential STORM. Gray clouds forming
          across the horizon.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Happy hour starts at five Dewart!

<b>                          DEWART
</b>
<b>                          (TO HIMSELF)
</b>           Not if it's rainin'...Ready?

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Oh, yeah.

                         

<b>          INT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY
</b>
          Samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric
          through her sewing machine. She's making curtains.
          NAT(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed
          not to sweat. She's a woman with rough edges.
          CAMMIE(24) cradles a brown-haired BABY on top of her
          pregnant, eight month belly.
          As Nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two
          kids, DJ(7) and SUE(5), playing with Hannah.

<b>                          NAT
</b>           They were just drinkin' and
           laughin' and oh, my god...it was
           like I was bein' in a museum and I
           saw the progress from apes to men.
           I saw it. I saw the future.
           Dewart, that was him...that was
           going to be him in 20 years.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Oh my god.
          Cammie laughs.

<b>                          NAT
</b>           Let me tell you, you laugh. You
           laugh. But this little one in your
           arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar
           just like `em. Yep...

<b>                          (GLANCES OUTSIDE)
</b>           Hannah!
          Samantha jumps up from her sewing to see outside. Hannah,
          with her back to the house, bangs a 2 X 4 with a rusted nail
          in the end into the ground. Samantha is out the door.

<b>           5.
</b>
                         

<b>          EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Samantha walks briskly, talking to the other children.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           You guys okay?

<b>                          SUE
</b>           Yeah.
          Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues
          banging the two-by-four into the ground. As soon as the
          child sees her mother, she stops.
          Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board
          away from her. Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at
          the same time.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           No. Don't touch.
          Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. Samantha
          touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.

<b>                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>           (signing and speaking)
           You understand?
          Hannah nods once, "yes".

<b>                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>           Oksy. Come here.
          Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the
          back corner of the yard. A STORM SHELTER is buried in the
          ground just behind the pile. It's a grass covered mound with
          two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky.
          She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her
          pants. Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh.
          Thunder rumbles low in the distance. She looks up at the
          approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks
          back inside.

<b>                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>           Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside.

                         

<b>          EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY
</b>

<b>          THUNDER STRIKE.
</b>          The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark
          soil into black mud.

<b>           6.
</b>
                         
          Curtis holds a rain slicker over his head. He watches as the
          hole they are drilling fills up with brown water. He lifts
          his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from
          the mud.
          Looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting
          up. He looks to Dewart, who smiles at him from behind the
          controls of the rig.

<b>                          DEWART
</b>           What? It's not my fault! I told
           you!

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Yeah. All right...All right! I'm
           callin' it! Shut it down!
          Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee.

                         

<b>          I/E. LAFORCHE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>          Samantha holds the front door open as Nat and Cammie leave
          with their children packed up and in tow. It's raining
          pretty hard outside.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Bye guys. Thanks for coming over.

<b>                          NAT
</b>           I'll call next week about the Lions
           Club supper.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Okay. Love you.

<b>                          CAMMIE

</b>           Bye Cam.
          Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat.
          Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. The
          rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen.

<b>          IN THE KITCHEN,
</b>          Hannah is sitting Indian-style at the glass doors watching
          the rain. Samantha walks over and kneels down behind her.
          She wraps her arms around Hannah, who lifts a hand to the
          glass.

<b>                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>           Can you sign s-t-o-r-m?

<b>           7.
</b>
                         
          Samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to Hannah's and
          signs "s-t-o-r-m". Hannah turns to see her mother's face,
          and Samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol.
          Fingers, spread and bent, moved downward.

<b>                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>           Storm.
          Hannah looks back out the window. They watch the storm
          together.

                         

<b>          I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/DEWART'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>          The blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard
          as Dewart fishes the last Busch tallboy out of icy water. He
          cracks it open and takes an extended sip.
          Curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his
          drunk friend.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           I gotta get home.

           five. She can't be no taller than
           5 foot.
          Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Shit man.
          The laughing subsides.

          Dewart is staring at Curtis.

<b>                          DEWART (CONT'D)
</b>           You got a good life Curtis.

          Curtis shrugs.

<b>                          DEWART (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm serious. I think that's the
           best compliment you can give a man,
           take a look at his life and say,
           that's good. That guy's doin'
           somethin' right.

<b>                          CURTIS

<b>                          DEWART
</b>           Hell I know that.
          Dewart sees something out his window.

<b>                          DEWART (CONT'D)

<b>                          CURTIS

          Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the
          maze of junk on their front lawn.
          Dewart passes her without saying a word. Curtis watches as
          she follows him inside the house, still talking. He shifts
          into drive and pulls away.

                         

<b>          INT. LAFORCHE HOME - NIGHT
</b>
          The lights are out and the house is quiet. Curtis eases open
          the front door and steps inside. Standing on the door mat,
          he slips off his mud-caked boots and gently sets them aside.

<b>          AT HANNAH'S BEDROOM DOOR,
</b>          Curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open.
          Hannah is curled up with the covers. He watches her sleep.
          Samantha, barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt, walks up behind
          Curtis. He turns his head when she approaches.

</b>           Hey baby.
          She wraps her arms around his waist and he lifts his elbow to
          make room for her. They whisper.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)

</b>           She was fine. She's still not
           playin' with the others, though.
           She can't connect. Honey, you
           gotta clean up that trash pile in
           the back. She fished out a board
           that had nails on it.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           I'll get to it this weekend.
          It's quiet for a moment.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           I still take off my boots so I
           won't wake her up.
          She smiles up at her husband.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           I still whisper.
          He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The
          house is silent.

                         

<b>          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
          Curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow.
          He keeps an eye on Hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic
          playscape in the middle of the backyard.
          The dog, Red, paces by the back door. He's agitated, but his
          movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his
          collar to a nearby post. He barks.

<b>          THUNDER STRIKES.
</b>          Curtis flinches at the loud boom. He looks to the sky and
          sees dark clouds twisting overhead. Hannah plays, unaffected
          by the noise.
          To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in the
          corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland
          that runs up to his property.
          Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete
          culvert that leads out to the open field.
          A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there.
          Red barks incessantly. He winces and strains against the
          rope tied to his collar.
          Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to the
          ground in the distance. Sparks shoot into the air leaving a
          circle of scorched crops. Another CRACK of thunder.

<b>           10.
</b>
                         
          A light rain begins. Red snaps his head around and bucks
          into the air. He gnashes at the rope.
          Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back to
          the approaching STORM CELL. He holds up his hand and studies
          the falling rain. It's the thick, amber colored liquid.
          With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy
          tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THREE
          TORNADOS out in the field.
          Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. He
          thrashes his head, the rope SNAPS, and the dog flies toward
          Curtis and Hannah.
          Curtis turns to see Red charging them. He barely has time to
          set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm.
          They crash to the ground, tangled together. Rain coming down
          hard now.
          Curtis yells and waves Hannah back. Red, snapping, buries
          his teeth into the muscles in Curtis' arm. Blood streams
          from the wound.
          Curtis screams in pain.

                         

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          Curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm. He grinds his
          teeth and doubles over in pain. It takes a moment for him to
          find his bearings.
          His breathing slows. He gently rubs his hand over the skin
          on his arm. Sweat has collected around his collar and
          temples.
          From the bed, sheets in a twisted mess, he looks around the
          room unsure of what just happened to him.

                         

<b>          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
          Eggs cool on a plate.
          Curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work. He stares
          vacantly at his breakfast.
          He looks up at Hannah. She sits on the floor surrounded by
          toy building blocks and plays with the dog. She rubs under
          Red's chest and in turn he licks her face. She smiles and
          gently pushes him away.
          Samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee.

</b>           Did you hear me? You got to be
           home, showered, ready to walk out
           the door by six tonight.
          Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off
          the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.

<b>                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>           What's wrong?

<b>                          CURTIS

</b>           She's fine down there. She had
           toast already.
          Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair.
          Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her
          chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Hannah. Come here. Hannah.

<b>          INT. DELTA AGRI-PRO MAIN OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          The main headquarters of Delta Agri-Pro is housed in a giant
          metal building. A row of cheaply built, 70's style offices
          with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse
          that contains all manner of agricultural and construction
          equipment. Tractors, backhoes, welding rigs, etc.
          A GROUP OF MEN, many of which were represented at Gator's bar
          yesterday, sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi-circle
          around JIM THOMPSON(53). He speaks, clipboard in hand.

<b>                          JIM
</b>           I didn't say you had control over
           the weather Russell, what I did say
           was that the top shelf has to be
           cleared by the 15th. That's non-
           negotiable.
          Dewart eats from a bag of Sunflower seeds. Curtis stares
          down at his forearm. He rubs the skin there. Jim runs a
          finger down his clipboard.

<b>                          JIM (CONT'D)
</b>           Umm, Curtis. Where we at on that
           east 82nd site?
          Curtis snaps his head up, takes a second.

</b>           Yesterday slowed us down. We
           couldn't get the second pilot hole
           drilled.
          Jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. A
          melodramatic move.

<b>                          JIM

          Dewart stands by a flatbed cart with a prefab DOGHOUSE
          sitting on it.
          Curtis loads chain-link fencing materials onto the cart.

                         

<b>          EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY
</b>
          The wheels of the well-drilling rig are half sunk into the
          muddy soil.
          Curtis stands over the hole being drilled. The turning metal
          pole suddenly seizes up and stops. Smoke begins to seep up
          from the hole.

</b>           We stripped that bit.

</b>           Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta
           re-set it.
          Dewart walks back to his controls. Curtis heads to the cab
          of the drilling rig and checks his watch.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Shit.
          Something catches his eye in the distance. Clearing past the
          rig, he walks out into the adjacent field.
          He removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland
          that stretch for miles in front of him.
          In the sky overhead,

<b>           14.

<b>          AN ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS ROLL IN UNISON.
</b>          Hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and shifts
          in the air. They dive bomb then ascend in intricate,
          GEOMETRIC patterns.
          Curtis watches, mesmerized.
          Dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches
          in reverse.

<b>                          DEWART
</b>           Curtis!
          Curtis acknowledges Dewart but can't take his eyes off the
          pattern of birds. They shrink and stretch from thick clumps
          to long cylindrical tubes. A choreography.
          Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking
          with the SOUND of metal on metal.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           You ever see birds fly like that?!

<b>          THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD,

          Curtis' work boots are encased in dry mud. Chunks have
          broken off and pepper the thin blue industrial carpet. His
          mud-stained fingers tap on the top of a desk. Dirt caked
          under his nails.

          Curtis looks over at Samantha, who is sitting in the desk
          next to him. She won't look at him.
          He cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room.
          An ASSISTANT TEACHER sits on a large, colorful rug with a
          GROUP of CHILDREN, all different ages, playing games that
          teach hand signs. Hannah actively participates in the group.

          Curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for "dad"

          Samantha turns over large flashcards with illustrated scenes
          on them. They take turns making the corresponding sign.
          Curtis stares at Samantha, but she's still giving him the
          cold shoulder. Finally, while holding up a card, she looks
          at him. He signs, "I'm sorry". A fist moving in a circular

          He shakes water off, wipes his face. The windows are smeared
          by thick, dark rain. It's hard to see out.
          He looks over to Hannah sitting in her car seat. It looks

          Curtis checks the rearview, but the back window is covered by
          the rain. He tries rolling down his window, but water blows
          in. He rolls it back up and the smudging gets worse.
          The truck shimmies from left to right, pushed by the wind. A
          THUNDER STRIKE rattles.
          Suddenly,

<b>          THE SHAPE OF A PERSON STANDING IN THE ROAD.

<b>           SHIT!
</b>          Curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel. The truck
          hydroplanes.
          CRASH! Curtis' head busts against the steering column. The
          front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop.
          The HISS of a broken radiator. Curtis winces from the blow
          to his head. Hannah is crying. He reaches over to her.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Are you okay?
          Hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying.
          Curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head. He's
          dazed, mumbling.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           You're okay.
          The truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched
          up a pole. A cut on his forehead has begun to bleed.
          He sees movement. A PERSON passes by the hazy side window.
          A SHAPE moves past the driver's window.
          The truck shifts as weight is added to the bed. The SOUND of
          SOMEONE pulling things from the back of the truck. A moment.
          WHACK! Curtis flinches as a 2X4 pounds the windshield.
          The truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the
          hood.
          Bump. Bump.
          The roof caves in with two FOOTSTEPS.
          Curtis looks around frantically. He reaches over to Hannah
          and begins to unstrap her from the car seat.

          SMASH! A BOARD breaks through the Passenger Window.
          A WOMAN, pale and aggressive, stands in the rain storm
          staring through the broken glass. She reaches for the lock.
          Curtis pulls Hannah from the child seat and recoils against
          his door but is jolted as another board CRASHES through the
          driver's window.
          A HAND yanks Curtis by his collar. He's pulled against the
          door. A pasty forearm wraps around his neck, choking him.
          He strains against the arm. Sucks air. Needing to breath.
          The Woman at the passenger door grabs for Hannah. Curtis
          kicks at her.
          A MAN's boot KICKS OUT the back window. The Man in the bed
          of the truck reaches for Curtis' face. He flails and kicks,
          unable to break free from the forearm at his door.
          The Woman gets hold of Hannah. The child is yanked from
          Curtis' arms. He screams.

          Hands claw at Curtis' face. Scratching. Blood streaks. The
          Woman has disappeared into the storm with Hannah.
          Curtis screams. Fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing
          hold of his cheek. They pull the cheek back. TEARING.
          He yells in pain.

          Samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back. She

          Curtis notices the dog, Red, sitting on his haunches looking

<b>          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY

          The reverse lights shine as Curtis' pick-up rumbles backward.
          Curtis eyes the side mirror as he maneuvers the truck into
          his backyard. In the mirror, the trash pile comes into view.
          Just behind it, the STORM SHELTER doors appear.
          The truck shutters to a stop. Curtis studies the Shelter in
          the side mirror for a moment. A grassy bulge with angled
          metal doors peeking over the trash heap. He climbs out.
          A blue tarp is pulled from the bed of the truck, floating
          down to the yard.
          Curtis slips on a pair of work gloves and continues to eye
          the Storm Shelter. He yanks a bale of chain-link from the
          bed of the truck and carries it to the back corner of the
          yard. He steals another glance back toward the Shelter.

<b>           21.

          Dropping the bale, he sizes up the space. He looks to the
          sky. It's a beautiful day.
          He begins counting off steps from the back fence line.

          Hannah kneels in front of a folding chair behind their BOOTH
          at an open-air flea market. She uses the seat of the chair
          as a table for a tiny porcelain tea set.
          Samantha stands over her display table smiling and nodding at
          perusing CUSTOMERS.

          of the yard so that half of the pen is made up by the

          Samantha turns to see a large woman holding up an intricately

          You can tell by the look of her that she's a flea market pro,
          a BARGAIN HUNTER(54).

          Samantha looks at the woman, who is almost daring her.

</b>           I can't go that low.

<b>                          BARGAIN HUNTER
</b>           Well that's my offer.
          The woman sets down the pillow and begins looking over other
          items on the table. Samantha bites the inside of her cheek.
          She doesn't like to haggle.

          The woman smiles and removes a Ziplock bag of assorted coins
          from her purse. Hannah takes the bag.

          Curtis unlatches a piece of the braided wire holding a
          separated section of fencing that acts like a gate.

<b>                          CURTIS

<b>           23.

          He opens it and looks down at Red, who sits at his feet. He
          speaks gently to the dog.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Good boy.
          Curtis closes the gate, kneels and places his hands on the
          fence. Red approaches so that his nose is touching Curtis'
          fingers. Curtis scratches him.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm sorry about this buddy. We

          Curtis stands, wiping his hands off on his jeans. He sees
          the Storm Shelter poking up from behind the trash pile. He
          looks down at Red.
          Curtis walks to the Shelter. Clearing past the trash pile,
          the shelter appears, the mound fully visible.
          Curtis stops at the angled doors. He studies them. A rusted
          padlock is snapped shut across the handles. He reaches out
          and lifts up the padlock. He yanks on it, then lets it fall.

          Coins splash across the kitchen counter. Curtis sets an
          empty coffee can back on the shelf in front of him and begins
          sifting through the change.
          Odd screws, buttons, then he gets to what he's looking for.
          A small set of brass keys on a matching ring. He grabs the
          keys from the pile and exits.

          Curtis walks back out to the storm shelter, keys in hand,
          long flashlight in his back pocket.
          He pulls up the padlock that holds the two rusted doors
          together. Popping off the rubber cover, he tries a key. The
          lock pops up. He unhooks it from the doors and lets it fall
          to the ground.
          Curtis strains to pull the first door open. It's heavy and
          sticks from lack of use. Finally, with a creak, the door
          swings back.

          Curtis holds his head to the side, a musty odor coming from
          inside. He forces the second door open.
          Curtis stands in front of the shelter, a gaping black hole
          angled up from the earth.
          He takes the flashlight from his pocket and turns it on. It
          illuminates concrete steps leading down.
          The dog, nose at the fence, watches from his pen on the other
          side of the yard.
          Curtis enters the shelter.

          It's pitch black inside. Curtis makes his way down the steps
          and holds out the flashlight. An assortment of trash on the
          ground, empty cans and water bottles, some candy wrappers.
          The whole shelter is only about 6' X 8'. His head fits fine,
          but he still ducks like he might bump it.
          He shines the light on the back wall. A rotted, wooden bench
          is bolted into the concrete there. Curtis walks to it and
          takes a seat.
          He's looking back toward the steps now. A shaft of light
          cuts a strict beam through the open doors, lighting only the
          concrete entry.
          Curtis takes in the quiet of the concrete box. He leans his
          head back on the wall and closes his eyes.
          He shuts off his flashlight. Left in the dark, he takes a
          deep breath. Exhales slowly.

<b>          INT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY

          It's daytime, but the house feels dark from the storm blowing
          outside. The SOUND of rain pelts the windows and roof.
          Curtis, dressed for work, walks from his bedroom down the
          hallway. He passes the den and stops at its entryway.

<b>          IN THE DEN,
</b>          Hannah sits on the couch with her back to him. She's on her
          knees looking out one of the front windows.
          A dull orange glow halos from the bank of windows. What
          sunlight there is appears diffused by the dark, thick rain
          smearing down the outside of the glass.

          Curtis flinches. He shows concern as heavier rain begins
          battering the house. The wind picks up making wood beams
          creak on their foundation.

<b>                          CURTIS
</b>           Hannah.
          Hannah doesn't move. She continues staring out the window.
          The SOUND of the storm outside intensifies. Windows begin to
          rattle in their frames.
          Curtis walks over and reaches for Hannah but is startled by
          the sight of a MAN'S FACE just outside the window. Hannah
          and the Man have been staring at one another.
          The Man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and
          out of sight.

          and heads out of the room.
          BANG. The front door rattles. Curtis stops and turns back.
          BANG. BANG. The SOUND of someone kicking at the front door.
          The storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch.
          The power goes out.
          The entire house vibrates, like a freight train running
          across the roof. The BANGING at the front door continues,
          frame giving way, as the STORM reaches its apex.
          Curtis, holding Hannah, kneels and braces himself in the
          entryway to the den. He covers the back of Hannah's head
          with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder.
          Then Silence. A stillness.
          The rain stops. No more banging at the front door. The SUN
          moves brightly though the front windows.

<b>          WOOSH.
</b>          The furniture in the den lifts off the ground. A couch,
          Lazyboy, coffee table and lamp. It all hangs in the air,
          floating for a moment. Quietly.
          Curtis watches, eyes wide. A rumbling. Grows. The SUNLIGHT
          vanishes.
          SMASH! The sound of the storm is sucked back into the room as
          the furniture crashes to the floor, breaking apart on impact.

<b>           28.

          The windows BLOW OUT.
          Curtis squeezes his eyes shut and pivots his body, trying to
          protect Hannah. Shards of glass splinter across his face.

          Curtis gasps for air. It doesn't come.
          Gasp. He's sucking for a breath. Hyperventilating.
          He rises up in bed, gasping. His face flushed and head
          soaked in sweat. His eyes dart around the room, frantically
          searching his surroundings.
          One more gasp, and air enters his lungs. He coughs. More
          air. Long, deep breaths. He's calming down.
          His breathing comes under control. His attention turns to
          something else. Something under the sheets.
          Curtis pulls back the bed sheets. The mattress is soaked in
          YELLOW urine. This scares him.
          His hand trembles as he reaches out to touch his wet boxers.
          The toilet FLUSHES. Footsteps in heels.
          Curtis quickly pulls the covers back up. Samantha enters the
          bedroom. She pulls her hair into a tight ponytail and picks
          earrings off a nearby dresser, her back to Curtis.

          There are only a few people, one of which is the LIBRARIAN
          sitting behind a central desk. It is an open room with
          cinder block walls painted in brightly colored shapes.

          Curtis finds the children's section to the left and leads
          Hannah over. She takes a seat at a kid's size table as
          Curtis grabs a Dinosaur book from a nearby display.
          Kneeling in front of her, Curtis shows her the book and
          motions with open hands to the ground.

<b>          AT THE COMPUTERS,

          up on a folding table. He eyes the search screen. Title,
          Author, Subject.
          He clicks on "Subject" and types the word "DREAMS". He
          scrolls through a list of titles and writes down a number.
          He looks back for Hannah. She's still flipping through her
          book. No one else is around.
          He begins another search. He types "MENTAL ILLNESS".

<b>          AT THE BOOK SHELVES,

          Samantha sits on the bed in her pajamas applying lotion to
          her legs. She wipes the remainder on her knuckles and looks
          at the empty spot on Curtis' side of the bed.

          Samantha walks into the kitchen and turns off the overhead
          light. She pauses, seeing something in the backyard.
          She stops at the back door and stares out at the storm
          shelter. The camp lantern's orange light glows through the
          open metal doors.
          She watches for a moment.

          The shelter has been cleaned up. The metal shelves hold
          canned food, water jugs and first aid supplies. Blankets and
          pillows are stacked on the other side of the room.
          Curtis sits in the back corner of the shelter on the wooden
          bench. He flips through one of the books from the library.
          The cover reads, "DREAM ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION". The
          book on mental illness sits by his feet.

          The Doctor's Office is a converted one-story residential
          house. Curtis slouches in a faux leather chair grouped in
          the small reception area. He has nodded off.
          His head snaps up. He sucks air through his nose and sits up
          in his chair. He sees a WOMAN(25) reading a children's book
          aloud to her DAUGHTER(3) on a colorful rug in the corner.
          A door opens and a NURSE with a clipboard steps out.

          The Doctor turns to a small table in the corner and grabs a
          wooden tongue depressor and an otoscope from a drawer.

</b>           Well, I think four nights is a
           little too soon to tell. My advice
           would be to not eat or drink
           anything after 8 o'clock at night.
           Cut back on any alcoholic drinks,
           tobacco, caffeine...get some daily

           sleeping is because of some dreams
           I've been havin'. I didn't think
           it was anything at first, but then
           the other day I woke up and the bed

          is considerably more involved than Curtis' last job site.
          Dump trucks, backhoes and cement mixers roll and beep across

          Curtis steps back from the arm of the drill. Dewart taps the
          wrench on two bolts to make sure they are secure.

<b>          A LOUD BOOM RATTLES. THUNDER.
</b>          Curtis flinches at the sound.

          of the drilling rig.

<b>          MORE THUNDER. ROLLING NOW.
</b>          Curtis steps back from the rig and checks the horizons.
          Nothing. It's a beautiful day.
          Dewart looks down at him. Curtis' face is pale, scared.
          Curtis looks at him. Not sure what to say. Curtis turns and
          walks to his truck.

          Another THUNDER STRIKE makes him flinch.
          Curtis VOMITS next to the back tire.
          He quickly stands, wiping his mouth. He checks over his
          shoulders to see if anyone has seen him.

          He rubs his eyes with the back of his hand and looks in the
          side mirror. The horizon is still clear.
          Curtis begins to hyperventilate. Short breaths accompanied
          by cold sweat. Sucking air. He can't breath. He panics.
          The truck tires slide on the gravel shoulder as he abruptly
          slams on the brakes and steers off the highway.
          Dust settles outside as Curtis begins to get his breathing
          under control. He rests his head on the steering wheel and
          shuts his eyes tight.
          Everything quiets down. His breathing. The road. No more
          thunder.
          Curtis looks out his passenger window.
          His truck has stopped in front of a Tractor Trailer Depot. A
          rusted shipping container with giant white letters painted on
          it reads, "CONTAINERS FOR SALE".
          Curtis stares at this. He climbs out of the truck.

                         

<b>          EXT. TRAILER DEPOT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Curtis walks around his truck to get a better look at the
          depot. The dirt lot is piled high with containers.
          He studies the "FOR SALE" sign, then a smaller sign next to
          it that lists available sizes.
          Curtis turns back to his truck and rubs his face, still
          shaking things off. He looks up at the sky. Clear and blue.
          A thought comes to him. He checks his watch.

          The door opens. SARAH(61), a plainly dressed woman much too

          The pump stops. The final amount reads, "$68.79". He hangs

          removed leaving the yard more open.
          Curtis begins to count steps out from the left edge of the

          Curtis sits alone on the couch, hunched over the coffee
          table. He writes on a yellow legal pad. It's a list with
          the heading, "REMODEL". It reads:

          of a pole next to the FIRST NATIONAL BANK sign.
          He looks down at a NEWSPAPER laid out on an end table next to
          him. He flips it over and studies the ads on the back. A
          big one in the corner catches his eye.
          It reads, "CUYAHOGA GUN AND KNIFE SHOW!" The ad lists items
          for sell/trade: ...Tactical Gear, Gas Masks, Batons...
          Curtis focuses in on the words "Gas Masks" and tears the ad
          out. JOHN MYERS(34) enters with a set of papers in his hand.
          Curtis quickly tucks the ad into his back pocket.
          Myers takes a seat in one of two chairs in front of his desk
          and looks over the papers. He takes a pen out of his pocket
          as Curtis sits down next to him.

          Her head is jostled. More. The bed begins to vibrate. Her
          eyes open. She turns over to see Curtis.
          He's having a SEIZURE.
          Samantha reaches for him. Eyes closed, his body convulses
          violently. Samantha quickly turns on a bedside lamp.

          Suddenly, the seizures stop. Curtis' body is still.
          Samantha freezes.
          His eyes open and he thrashes up in bed. Samantha jumps,
          tripping and stumbling backward.
          Curtis sucks short breaths into his lungs. His head darts
          back and forth, eyes wild. He sees Samantha staring up at
          him from the floor. He begins to calm down.
          Curtis touches his mouth. Sees the blood there.

          The ambulance lights splash across the house. Curtis escorts
          TWO EMTs down the front walk. He favors his left leg,
          walking with a slight limp.

          Nat gets up to refill her drink. She looks out the back door
          and surveys the construction zone. A FORKLIFT lowers the
          Shipping Container into the giant hole in the backyard. Nat
          shakes her head.

          doesn't look up from her pad.

          Curtis meanders inside. He sees police tactical and survival
          gear behind the counter. Chief among them is a collection of
          gas masks hanging on the rear partition.

          Curtis stands at the driver's door of his pick-up. The box
          sits on the seat in front of him. He opens it and removes
          one of the gas masks.
          He stares into its vacant plastic eyes. He drops the mask
          back into the box and shakes his head. Sighs, frustrated

          goggles, he cuts a circular hole in the top of the container
          with a small blowtorch.
          The sparks stop and Curtis raises the goggles to inspect his

          metal falls into the container.

          Curtis smiles to himself. He turns to find KYLE(42) standing
          at the edge of the hole. His hands are tucked into the back
          of his jeans and he's sizing up the work.
          Curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto
          ground level. He holds out a hand and Kyle shakes it, never
          taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter.

          Curtis looks at her, concerned. She stares back,
          emotionless. She slowly looks down at the counter next to

          Curtis goes through it.

          The lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is.
          Two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of
          supplies. Canned food, a small gas burner.
          Curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes
          about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the

          She folds the bills over and stuffs them into her purse

          He signs something that makes her laugh. Hannah smacks a

          A FLOCK OF BIRDS, flying in intricate geometric patterns,
          swarm above the house at the end of the street. They twist
          and bend into speckled black shapes.
          Hannah, watching, walks into the street. Curtis catches her
          by the hand. He turns away from the birds to see a STORM
          CELL building on the opposite horizon. He scoops Hannah into
          his arms, stepping back from it.
          The SOUND of the birds grows louder. Curtis pivots to find
          the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him. He
          turns away as the wall of birds crash past him. The force so
          powerful it knocks him backward.
          He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and
          wings. The Flock passes. Curtis stands, his face cut and
          scraped. Hannah cries, clinging to his chest.

<b>          SMASH!
</b>          The windshield of a car parked next to him SHATTERS. Curtis
          looks at the broken glass. A dead bird, it's neck broken,
          rests crumpled on the hood.

<b>          SMACK!
</b>

          Another bird crashes into the asphalt just in front of him.
          Then another. Curtis looks up. The Flock of birds are
          circling overhead and diving down at him.
          More birds crashing to the ground. Curtis covers his head.
          The neighborhood's tornado SIRENS begin to sound.
          Curtis rushes Hannah toward his front door as dozens of birds
          plummet from the sky. The sirens BLARING.

          Curtis wakes to Samantha shaking him by the shoulders. She's
          nearly on top of him in the bed.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Curtis! Wake up! Wake up!
          TORNADO SIRENS continue to scream throughout the
          neighborhood.
          Curtis looks to the window. Rain and hail are battering the
          house. He jumps to his feet and grabs Samantha by the arm.
          They rush out of the room.

                         

<b>          INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Curtis bursts into the room. Hannah is standing at the
          window looking out. Curtis scoops her up, scaring her. She
          begins to cry as they run from the room.

                         

<b>          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - NIGHT
</b>
          Wind blows fiercely as pellets of hail bounce off the ground.
          Rain cuts at a sharp angle. The Tornado Sirens continue.
          Curtis, Hannah in his arms and Samantha close behind, exits
          the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter. He
          passes Hannah to Samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys.
          At the doors to the shelter, Samantha holds her robe up to
          shield Hannah from the hail. Curtis gets the lock and opens
          the door. They go inside.

                         

<b>          INT. STORM SHELTER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Curtis slams the doors behind them. It's pitch black until
          he gets to the switch on the lantern. The room fills with
          the orange glow as Curtis snaps the padlock through the door
          handles.

</b>           Come on. It's okay.
          Curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of
          the shelter. Samantha takes Hannah and sits with her on one
          of the cots. She's signing to her, trying to calm her down.

          Curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting
          through it. He removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask
          connected to a small tank.
          He goes over and kneels in front of Hannah. He tries
          slipping the oxygen mask over her face. Samantha grabs his
          wrist.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           No. Don't do that.

          He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face..

</b>           There we go. All right. Keep it out

          He signs to her.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Hey. I love you. It's okay.
          Curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank.
          He climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them. He
          slips on his gas mask.
          Samantha is hesitant. She looks at her husband in the mask
          and leans back against the side of the container. Hannah
          looks up at her. She touches her mother's mask.
          Samantha slips on the gas mask.

          The camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up. The
          faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside.
          The family sits huddled together on the cot, wearing their
          masks.

                         

<b>          INT. STORM SHELTER - LATER
</b>
          A CRACK of thunder rattles the shelter. Curtis snaps awake,
          still wearing his gas mask.
          Samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep. Hannah
          sleeps under Curtis' arm. He gently lays her down on the cot
          and stands to stretch.
          He walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs a
          small flashlight off the metal shelving. He clicks it on and
          moves over to the concrete steps.
          He takes a seat and listens. He places his hand onto the
          metal door. A BOOM of thunder.
          He can hear the rain and wind blowing outside.

          Curtis' head moves. He sees that Samantha and Hannah have
          removed their masks.

</b>           We're fine. Take it off.
          Curtis slips the mask off his face. Worried, he takes a
          breath.

          Curtis slowly gets to his feet. He sees the dark entryway to
          the original section of the shelter. Taking the lantern, he
          walks to it.
          Samantha and Hannah follow.
          Curtis stops just inside. He holds the lantern up,
          illuminating the padlocked metal doors.
          He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. He
          places his hand on the door. He flinches.

          Samantha stares at him. The room is silent.

          He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. He
          watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. She
          looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head "no".
          Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from
          earlier.

          Hannah walks to her mother. Samantha holds onto her.
          Curtis steps back from them. They watch him, their backs to
          the doors. He flinches and covers his mouth.

</b>           Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We

           the door.
          Curtis is on the verge of tears.
          He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. He removes the
          keys. He holds them out to Samantha.

</b>           I'm sorry. I can't.
          Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis. Tears shake from
          his trembling face.

           This is something you have to do.
          He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself,
          trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the
          back of his hands and takes a deep breath.
          Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up
          to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to
          Samantha.

<b>                          CURTIS

          Samantha picks Hannah up in her arms and Curtis watches them
          retreat to the rear wall.
          He goes back to the lock. He inserts the key. The padlock
          pops open. Curtis removes it. He looks back at Samantha,
          then flings open the doors.

<b>          SUNLIGHT.

          He stares up at a crystal blue sky. Samantha watches as
          Curtis steps out of the shelter.

          the corner of his eye he catches,

<b>          A MAN PASSING BY.

          power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner
          of the house. A power line dangles overhead.
          He turns to see NEIGHBORS in their yards clearing debris.
          Leaves and branches clutter the ground. The aftermath of a
          storm.
          Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah. She
          surveys the damage.

          picnic table is set with plastic place mats and forks. WIND
          lifts the corner of a stack of napkins. The wind blows
          harder, fanning the napkins off the table.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           What?
          Curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet.
          He looks down at Hannah, who watches, mesmerized. Scared,
          she looks to her father. He grabs her under the arms and
          rests her on his hip. She buries her head into his chest.

<b>          AT THE CONDO,
</b>          A gust of wind greets Samantha as she walks out onto the deck
          holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili. She stops,
          seeing the horizon. Her mouth falls open.
          She slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table, her
          mind racing. She looks down at Curtis in disbelief.

<b>           91.
</b>
                         
          Curtis looks up to the Condo and makes eye contact. He
          studies her face.
          Samantha looks at her husband, trying to process it all. She
          looks out at the horizon then back down to Curtis. Concern
          on her face, she nods to him.
          Curtis sees her nod.
          Samantha's eyes, still locked on Curtis, soften, as if to
          apologize. After a moment, she mouths to him, "I love you."
          Curtis nods back to her.
          She looks back up to the shoreline.

<b>          ON THE BEACH,
</b>          Curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo.

<b>          AT THE CONDO,
</b>          Samantha hasn't moved from the porch. A light rain begins to
          fall. Her hands grip the railing. She turns her left palm
          up. Dark rain collects there.

<b>          ON THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF HER,
</b>
<b>          THE WATER HAS RECEDED INTO THE GULF SOME 100 YARDS. THE DARK
</b>
<b>          SANDY BOTTOM LOOKS ODD STRETCHED OUT SO FAR. A STORM CELL
</b>
<b>          SITS MASSED ON THE HORIZON. CHURNING BLACK CLOUDS FILLED
</b>
<b>          WITH LAYERS OF HORIZONTAL LIGHTNING.
</b>          Behind Samantha, Curtis appears in the open sliding door
          clutching Hannah. The Storm Cell is reflected in the glass
          next to him.

<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Sam.
          Samantha looks down at her palm. She rubs the thick, viscous
          rain in her fingers. She looks back up at the storm.
          On Samantha's face,

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Okay.

<b>           THE END.
</b>
<b>
