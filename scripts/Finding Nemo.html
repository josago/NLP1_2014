</b>| Okay, this is the work-in-progress FINDING NEMO film transcript.  |
| Why is it 'work-in-progress' you might ask? Well for one, this    |
| isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    |
| may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     |
| spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    |
| where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   |
| makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    |
| 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   |
| of equal signs (=).                                               |
<b>|                                                                   |
</b>| This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have    |
| any. What you CAN'T do, however, is to edit it and take credit    |
| for it. Although I do not own the movie or it's screenplay, this |
| transcript was made with no intention of copyright infringement |
| and the like. Enjoy. And remember: 'Fish are friends, not food'. |

<b>MARLIN
</b>Wow.

<b>CORAL
</b>Mmm.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Wow.

<b>CORAL
</b>Mmm-hmm.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Wow.

<b>CORAL
</b>Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful.

<b>MARLIN
</b>So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna
get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your
man deliver or did he deliver?


<b>                                             1
</b><b>
</b><b>CORAL
</b>My man delivered.

<b>MARLIN
</b>And it wasn't so easy.

<b>CORAL
</b>Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

<b>MARLIN
</b>You better believe they did--every single one of them.

<b>CORAL
</b>Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.

<b>MARLIN
</b>So, you do like it, don't you?

<b>CORAL
</b>No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by
their bedroom window.

<b>CORAL
</b>Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Oh, right. Right.

<b>CORAL
</b>Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.

<b>MARLIN
</b>You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.

<b>CORAL
</b>I like Nemo.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

<b>CORAL
</b>Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Yeah. What if they don't like me?

<b>CORAL
</b>Marlin.

<b>MARLIN
</b>No, really.

<b>CORAL
</b>There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.

<b>CORAL
</b>What?

<b>MARLIN
</b>You remember how we met?

<b>CORAL
</b>Well, I try not to.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'

<b>CORAL
</b>Marlin!

<b>MARLIN
</b>
<b>                                             2
</b><b>
</b>'Well, you gotta look a little closer because it's wiggling'.

<b>CORAL
</b>Get away!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?

<b>MARLIN
</b>[gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get
inside, you, right now.

<b>MARLIN
</b>No!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Coral! Coral?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Coral? Oh!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will
never let anything happen to you...Nemo.

<b>======================================================================================
</b>
<b>NEMO
</b>First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!

<b>MARLIN
</b>I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.

<b>NEMO
</b>Not you, dad. Me!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Okay...huh?

<b>NEMO
</b>Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!
It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!

<b>MARLIN
</b>All right, I'm up.

<b>NEMO
</b>Oh boy--whoa!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Nemo!

<b>NEMO
</b>First day of school!

<b>MARLIN
</b>[gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.
All right, where's the break? You feel a break?

<b>NEMO
</b>No.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?

<b>NEMO
</b>No.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Are you woozy?

<b>NEMO
</b>No.

<b>MARLIN
</b>How many stripes do I have?


<b>                                             3
</b><b>
</b><b>NEMO
</b>I'm fine.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Answer the stripe question!

<b>NEMO
</b>Three.

<b>MARLIN
</b>No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,
you're okay. How's the lucky fin?

<b>NEMO
</b>Lucky.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Let's see.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

<b>NEMO
</b>Come on, dad. It's time for school.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.

<b>NEMO
</b>Ohh...

<b>MARLIN
</b>Do you want this anemone to sting you?

<b>NEMO
</b>Yes.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Brush.

<b>NEMO
</b>Okay, I'm done.

<b>MARLIN
</b>You missed a spot.

<b>NEMO
</b>Where?

<b>MARLIN
</b>There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!

<b>======================================================================================
</b>
<b>MARLIN
</b>All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?

<b>NEMO
</b>It's not safe.

<b>MARLIN
</b>That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,
if you wanna do it four times--

<b>NEMO
</b>Dad..

<b>MARLIN
</b>All right. Come on, boy.

<b>NEMO
</b>Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!

<b>MARLIN
</b>
<b>                                             4
</b><b>
</b>I highly doubt that.

<b>NEMO
</b>Have you ever met a shark?

<b>MARLIN
</b>No, and I don't plan to.

<b>NEMO
</b>How old are sea turtles?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Sea turtles? I don't know.

<b>NEMO
</b>Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
a hundred years old!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,
hold my fin.

<b>NEMO
</b>Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

<b>FISH KIDS
</b>Bye, mom!

<b>FISH MOM
</b>I'll pick you up after school.

<b>CRAB KID
</b>Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Come on, we'll try over there.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

<b>BOB
</b>Well, look who's out of the anemone.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Yes. Shocking, I know.

<b>BOB
</b>Marty, right?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Marlin.

<b>BOB
</b>Bob.

<b>TED
</b>Ted.

<b>BILL
</b>Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.

<b>BOB/TED
</b>Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
other fish.

<b>BILL
</b>Aw, come on, clownie.

<b>TED
</b>Yeah, do something funny.

<b>                                             5
</b><b>
</b><b>BOB
</b>Yeah!

<b>MARLIN
</b>All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place
and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them   were walking, so forget that I--

<b>BOB
</b>Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!

<b>KIDS
</b>Whoa!

<b>MR. JOHANSSEN
</b>All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?

<b>NEMO
</b>Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?

<b>MARLIN
</b>I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

<b>MARLIN
</b>That's where I would play

<b>PEARL
</b>What's wrong with his fin?

<b>TAD
</b>He looks funny!

<b>SHELDON
</b>Ow! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?

<b>BOB
</b>Be nice. It's his first time at school.

<b>MARLIN
</b>He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.

<b>NEMO
</b>Dad.

<b>PEARL
</b>See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.

<b>SHELDON
</b>I'm H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]

<b>TAD
</b>I'm obnoxious.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>[singing] Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the
open sea.

<b>KIDS
</b>Mr. Ray!

<b>SHELDON
</b>Come on, Nemo.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Whoa, you better stay with me.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>[singing]..mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and
me to see.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Huh, I wonder where my class has gone?

<b>KIDS
</b>
<b>                                               6
</b><b>
</b>We're under here!

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so
lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.

<b>NEMO
</b>Dad, you can go now.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Well, hello. Who is this?

<b>NEMO
</b>I'm Nemo.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

<b>NEMO
</b>Okay.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>You live in what kind of home?

<b>NEMO
</b>An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.

<b>NEMO
</b>Dad, it's time for you to go now.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.

<b>JIMMY
</b>Aw, man!

<b>MR. RAY
</b>[singing]

<b>MARLIN
</b>Bye, Nemo!

<b>NEMO
</b>Bye, dad!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Bye, son! Be safe.

<b>BOB
</b>Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?

<b>BILL
</b>Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.

<b>MARLIN
</b>They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?

<b>BOB
</b>Hey, Marty. Calm down.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!

<b>BOB
</b>'Pony boy'?

<b>                                             7
</b><b>
</b><b>BILL
</b>You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

<b>TED
</b>Pity.

<b>======================================================================================
</b>
<b>MR. RAY
</b>[singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species
that live in thesea.

<b>NEMO
</b>Whoa.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>[singing] There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come
on, sing with me. Oh...!

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Just the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food
with the rays of the sun...

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Okay, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps]
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.
There are as many protein pairs contained in this...

<b>TAD
</b>Come on, let's go.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Come on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa,
ctenophora, bryozoas, three!

<b>NEMO
</b>Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.

<b>TAD
</b>Cool.

<b>TAD
</b>Saved your life!

<b>PEARL
</b>Aw, you guys made me ink.

<b>NEMO
</b>What's that?

<b>TAD
</b>I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
butt.

<b>NEMO
</b>Whoa.

<b>PEARL
</b>Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

<b>SHELDON
</b>Oh, look at me. I'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa!

<b>SHELDON
</b>Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.

<b>PEARL
</b>Okay. Beat that.

<b>TAD
</b>Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

<b>NEMO
</b>Uh, my dad says it's not safe.


<b>                                             8
</b><b>
</b><b>MARLIN
</b>Nemo, no!

<b>NEMO
</b>Dad?

<b>MARLIN
</b>You were about to swim into open water!

<b>NEMO
</b>No, I wasn't go out--but dad!

<b>MARLIN
</b>It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--

<b>PEARL
</b>Sir, he wasn't gonna go.

<b>TAD
</b>Yeah, he was too afraid.

<b>NEMO
</b>No, I wasn't.

<b>MARLIN
</b>This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out
there.
You know you can't swim well.

<b>NEMO
</b>I can swim fine, dad, okay?

<b>MARLIN
</b>No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.

<b>NEMO
</b>No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--

<b>MARLIN
</b>Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do
these
things but you just can't, Nemo!

<b>NEMO
</b>I hate you.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a
scientist, sir. Is there any problem?

<b>MARLIN
</b>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little
too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

MARLINLook, I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost
from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking--

<b>FISH KID
</b>Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get
you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one
move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

<b>TAD
</b>[whispering] He touched the butt.

<b>MARLIN
</b>You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...big--


<b>                                             9

</b><b>NEMO
</b>Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!

<b>MARLIN
</b>I'm coming, Nemo!

<b>KIDS
</b>Aaaah!

<b>MR. RAY
</b>Get under me, kids!

<b>NEMO
</b>Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!

<b>DIVER
</b>Whoa! Hold on.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No!
Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!

<b>DORY
</b>Look out!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Waaaah!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Ooh, ooh...

<b>DORY
</b>Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?

<b>MARLIN
</b>He's gone, he's gone..

<b>DORY
</b>There, there. It's all right.

<b>MARLIN
</b>He's gone.

<b>DORY
</b>It'll be okay.

<b>MARLIN
</b>No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.

<b>DORY
</b>Hey, I've seen a boat.

<b>MARLIN
</b>You have?

<b>DORY
</b>It passed by not too long ago.

<b>MARLIN
</b>A white one?

<b>DORY
</b>Hi. I'm Dory.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Where!? Which way!?

<b>DORY
</b>Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!

<b>MARLIN
</b>
<b>                                             10
</b><b>
</b>Thank you! Thank you, thank you so much!

<b>DORY
</b>No problem.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Hey! Wait!

<b>DORY
</b>Will you quit it?

<b>MARLIN
</b>What?

<b>DORY
</b>I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Huh?

<b>DORY
</b>You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah,
oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Wait a minute..

<b>DORY
</b>Stop following me, okay!?

<b>MARLIN
</b>What? You're showing me which way the boat went!

<b>DORY
</b>A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this
way. Follow me!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat
was going!

<b>DORY
</b>I did? Oh dear...

<b>MARLIN
</b>If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!

<b>DORY
</b>No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!

<b>DORY
</b>No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]

<b>BRUCE
</b>Hello.

<b>DORY
</b>Well, hi!

<b>BRUCE
</b>Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of
bites like you doing out so late, eh?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.

<b>BRUCE
</b>Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?

<b>DORY
</b>
<b>                                             11
</b><b>
</b>You mean like a party?

<b>BRUCE
</b>Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?

<b>DORY
</b>Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--

<b>BRUCE
</b>Oh, come on, I insist.

<b>MARLIN
</b>O-okay..that's all that matters.

<b>DORY
</b>Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!

<b>BRUCE
</b>Ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

<b>BRUCE
</b>Anchor! Chum!

<b>ANCHOR
</b>There you are, Bruce, finally!

<b>BRUCE
</b>We got company.

<b>ANCHOR
</b>It's about time, mate.

<b>CHUM
</b>We've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!

<b>ANCHOR
</b>We almost had a feeding frenzy.

<b>CHUM
</b>Come on, let's get this over with.

<b>======================================================================================
</b>
<b>BRUCE
</b>Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..

<b>BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
</b>'I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must
first change myself. Fish are friends, not food'.

<b>ANCHOR
</b>Except stinkin' dolphins.

<b>CHUM
</b>Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're sooo cute! 'Hey, look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin!
Let me flip for 'ya! Ain't I a somethin'!'

<b>BRUCE
</b>Right, then. Today's meeting is step 5, 'BRING A FISH FRIEND'. Now do you all have your
friends?

<b>ANCHOR
</b>Got mine.

<b>DORY
</b>Hey there!

<b>BRUCE
</b>How 'bout you, Chum?

<b>CHUM
</b>Oh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.


<b>                                             12
</b><b>
</b><b>BRUCE
</b>That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself
to one of my friends.

<b>CHUM
</b>Oh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?

<b>BRUCE
</b>I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.

<b>ANCHOR/CHUM
</b>Hello, Bruce.

<b>BRUCE
</b>It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and
made into soup.

<b>CHUM
</b>You're an inspiration to all of us.

<b>ANCHOR
</b>Amen.

<b>BRUCE
</b>Right, then. Who's next?

<b>DORY
</b>Ooh! Pick me! Pick me!

<b>BRUCE
</b>Yes, the little Sheila down the front.

<b>DORY
</b>Woo-hoo!

<b>BRUCE
</b>Come on up here.

<b>DORY
</b>Hi. I'm Dory.

<b>BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
</b>Hello, Dory.

<b>DORY
</b>And, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

<b>CHUM
</b>Hey, that's incredible.

<b>BRUCE
</b>Good on 'ya, mate!

<b>DORY
</b>Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.

<b>BRUCE
</b>All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Me? I don't have a problem.

<b>BRUCE
</b>Oh. Okay..

<b>BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
</b>Denial.

<b>BRUCE
</b>Just start with your name.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--

<b>CHUM
</b>A clownfish? Really?!


<b>                                             13
</b><b>
</b><b>BRUCE
</b>Go on, tell us a joke!

<b>CHUM
</b>Ooh! I love jokes!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea
cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the
sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

<b>NEMO
</b>Daddy!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Nemo!

<b>CHUM
</b>Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

<b>BRUCE
</b>For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

<b>MARLIN
</b>No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.

<b>DORY
</b>Oh my, you poor fish.

<b>CHUM
</b>Humans. Think they own everything.

<b>ANCHOR
</b>Probably American.

<b>BRUCE

filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And
when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll
ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the

put you right past Sydney.

</b>Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.

<b>DORY
</b>I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should swim through.

<b>MARLIN
</b>And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.

<b>DORY
</b>Come on, trust me on this.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Trust you?

<b>DORY
</b>Yes, trust. It's what friends do.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Look! Something shiny!

<b>DORY

<b>MARLIN
</b>Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it.

<b>DORY
</b>Okay.

<b>DORY
</b>Boy, sure is clear up here.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time.

<b>DORY
</b>Hey, little guy.

<b>MARLIN
</b>You wanted to go through the trench.

<b>DORY
</b>I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come here,
Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. [Baby talk]---oww!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Dory! That's a jellyfish!

<b>DORY
</b>Bad Squishy! Bad Squishy!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see.

<b>DORY
</b>Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

<b>MARLIN
</b>I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look.

<b>DORY
</b>Heeey, how come it didn't sting you?

<b>MARLIN
</b>It did. It's just that..

<b>DORY
</b>Ow! Ow, oww!

<b>MARLIN
</b>..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings.
Come here.

<b>DORY
</b>Ow, ow! Oww!

<b>MARLIN
</b>It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?

<b>DORY
</b>Yeah.

<b>MARLIN
</b>That we don't wanna touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a
little one.[gasps]

<b>MARLIN/DORY
</b>Aaaah!

</b>Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you,

<b>DORY
</b>Ooh! Two in a row, beat that.

<b>MARLIN
</b>Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.

<b>DORY
</b>A game?

<b>MARLIN
</b>A game.

<b>DORY
</b>A game?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Yes.

<b>DORY
</b>Aah! I love games! Pick me!

<b>MARLIN
</b>All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins.

<b>DORY
</b>Okay!

<b>MARLIN
</b>Rules, rules, rules!

<b>DORY
</b>Okay!

<b>MARLIN
</b>You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops.

<b>DORY
</b>Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!

<b>MARLIN
</b>W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait!

<b>DORY
</b>Weeee!

<b>MARLIN

</b>Wait a minute--whoa! Dory!

<b>DORY
</b>Weeee!

<b>MARLIN
</b>So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time.
I can do this, just be careful.

<b>DORY
</b>Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!

<b>DORY
</b>Ha ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed.

<b>MARLIN
</b>The question is, Dory, are you hungry?

<b>DORY
</b>Huh? Hungry?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Yeah, 'cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish
is the winner! Woohoo! We did it! We're gonna...Dory? Oh no. Dory! Dory! Dory! [gasps]

<b>DORY
</b>Ugh...am I disqualified?

<b>MARLIN
</b>No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where

</b>So where are you going?

<b>MARLIN
</b>Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.

<b>TURTLE KIDS
</b>[gasp]

<b>DORY
</b>No way.

<b>SQUIRT
</b>What happened?

<b>MARLIN
</b>No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it.

<b>TURTLE KIDS
</b>Awww! Please?

<b>SQUIRT
</b>Pleeeease?

<b>MARLIN
</b>[sighs] Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here.

<b>DORY
</b>Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.

<b>MARLIN
</b>And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been
so tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when
he was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.
So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them...

<b>TURTLE KID
</b>They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..

<b>SMALL FISH
</b>..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!

<b>BIG FISH
</b>Golly, that's amazing!

<b>SMALL FISH
</b>And then dives thousands of..

<b>LOBSTER
</b>..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.
How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..

<b>SWORDFISH
</b>..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...

<b>DOLPHIN
</b>So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian
Current.

<b>FEMALE BIRD
</b>Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..

<b>MALE BIRD 1
</b>..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..

<b>                                               36
</b><b>
</b><b>MALE BIRD 2
</b>..nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

<b>MALE BIRD 3
</b>That's one dedicated father if you ask me.

<b>GULLS
</b>Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

<b>NIGEL
</b>Oh, would you just shut up! You're rats with wings!

<b>PELICAN
</b>..bloke's been lookin' for his boy Nemo.

<b>NIGEL
</b>Nemo?

<b>PELICAN
</b>He was taken off the reef by divers and this..

<b>NIGEL
</b>There, take it! You happy!

<b>GULLS
</b>Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

<b>NIGEL
</b>Hey, hey, hey! Say that again! You said something about Nemo. What was it?

</b>No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that

all sorts of--

<b>NEMO

</b>Marlin?

<b>NIGEL
</b>You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat
you were on like a maniac.

<b>NEMO
</b>Really?

<b>NIGEL
</b>He's swimming and   he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic
sharks capture him   and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased
by a monster with   huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a
reward? He gets to   battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch
of sea turtles on   the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right

</b>Stop that! It's half-empty!
