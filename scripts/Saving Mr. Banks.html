<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>          A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,
          spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
          white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)
          dances amongst the nimbus.

<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)
</b>           --Like something is brewing,
           about to begin--
          The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down
          through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small
          town in the distance.

</b>          Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,
          bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
          There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts
          the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
          park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from
          flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
          She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face
          to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her
          concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we
          will also know as GINTY.)

<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)
</b>           --But I feel what's to happen, all

<b>                          HAPPENED BEFORE--
</b>          Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of
          a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind
          becomes real.

          P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position
          as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the
          sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of
          stiff and steely determination.
          Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha
          smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the
          walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with
          men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit
          on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.
          Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,
          white.
          Downstairs the doorbell rings.
          Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.
          It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,
          smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.

          Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of
          sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.
          DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked
          inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him.

          Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long
          frustrated breath.

          Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to
          the window, she looks out at the tarmac.
          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

          signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies:

          fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing
          over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands

          from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night
          stand, followed by another bottle and another and another.
          The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up,
          the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come
          streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses
          windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature
          Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed
          picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down
          an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.

          front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns
          her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans
          forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly
          unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.

          at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the

           fairy dust can make you fly!
          Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then
          just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and
          switches him off.

          Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes
          her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.
          The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her

          Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately,
          not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and
          Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car
          and rush round to open the passenger door.

          a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.

          A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to
          the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to
          Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.

          We hear a man's cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the
          flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms
          outstretched.

          serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to
          greet her.

          Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of
          enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to
          get her in an embrace.

          compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in
          decades!

          seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign
          above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of

          clasped around her body, her face to the sky. She sits
          perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out,
          patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her.
          Pamela, opens her eyes and Ralph nods hello. He opens the

          Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies
          the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails. The

          instead.

          But the barman has already moved on to another patron.
          Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come
          and go. The barman talks with another customer further along
          the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks
          like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring
          into her empty cup.

          Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a

          Travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air, stabbing
          piles of papers, filing cabinets, desks.

          All eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to
          have forgotten. Travers is overcome with embarrassment and
          guilt.

           illusion.
          He stares across the river, experiencing a wave of deep
          melancholy. Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound
          unhappiness, but unable to understand its source.

          awake. Staring into the darkness.
          Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for
          something to help her. Nothing. She groans as she drags
          herself out of bed, pacing the room, counting steps.

          Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the
          bed with her and climbs back under the covers, clinging onto
          the stuffed toy for comfort.

           the very enemy of sentiment and
           whimsy. She is truthful, she
           doesn't sugar coat the darkness in
           the world that these children will
           eventually come to know. She
           prepares them for it, she deals in
           honesty. One must clean one's room;
           it won't magically do it itself!
          She waves the script in the air.

          Pamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at
          the stars. The pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the
          water making it look like a chalk painting.

</b>
          Ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped
          around her body, face to the sky.
          The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last
          deafening chorus of the birds.
          Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit
          jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. His
          shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. His face is a study of
          something close to despair.
          He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and
          immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of
          greeting.

          Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her

          She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her. Ginty
          gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm.
          He swallows hard, eyes welling.

          He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the
          porch.
          Ginty is unnerved by her Travers' demeanor, she creeps around
          to the side of the house where she watches her father appears
          in the window of the washroom. She doesn't know what to do as
          he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing.

          around her chest, her face turned to the window.

          Ginty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush
          in her hand, dripping colour down her arm.
          She is nudged to the present by her teacher, MRS CORRY.

          Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads:

</b>          Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with
          stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its

          Margaret, Biddy and Ginty walk into the fairground. Tents are
          erected, farmers show off their sheep, children clutch sticks
          of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white
          horse amongst the drearier others, roses upon its bridal.

          Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his

          begins to dawn and she turns away.
          It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to
          see the group part, revealing Travers at its centre.

          There's a smattering of applause, Travers is encouraged,
          Margaret and Ginty look relieved, even hopeful.
          But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs
          the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front
          of the dais.

           next? Oh! It's a marvellous idea to
           encourage children to open
           accounts. My daughter, the Princess
           Ginty-- she's-- uh.
           (looks at Ginty)
           How old are you? Come up here.
          Ginty - what? Me?
          Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs,
          makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais.
          Margaret watches, growing uneasy.

          Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage,
          Travers leaning on Ginty's shoulder. The shameful glare of

          and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap
          as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly
          injury, Travers cannot stop laughing.

          Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper
          from her pocket.

          The agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand. Finally, the

          Ginty is devastated. But more than this there's a hardening
          in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far
          she's held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela
          to come.

          and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of

          Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite
          sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea.
          Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits
          and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the
          area around her.

          She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs
          together.

          looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a
          small line through the grass then hands it to him.

          Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder
          for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.
          Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.

          holes in it.

          and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of
          Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig

          into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park.

          She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily
          outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar

          From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves. Margaret
          turns her head and there, atop the horse, is Ginty.
          Margaret begins to weep.
          Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother,
          wading into the water to grab hold of her.
          Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep

          Ginty's eyes fix on Aunt Ellie's umbrella on the back of the

          stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step
          by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The
          sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted
          with blood. The front of her father's nightdress is also
          bloodstained. Ginty's eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes
          open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither
          peaceful nor distressed. Just-- nothing.

          Pamela and Diarmuid sit together. Pamela is quite changed,
          she looks younger, radiant, worry free.

<b>                          DIARMUID

          Polly kicks the door open with her foot and plonks the tea
          down in front of Pamela and Diarmuid. She sneezes twice,
          doesn't bother to pour and turns to leave.

          Pamela narrows her eyes at him.

          Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle her cabin

          from the top of the film appears.

          horror.

          Pamela takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at
          the tarmac.
          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

          The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother
          hovering for a tip.
          Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the
          chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere
          of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous
          stuffed Mickey Mouse.

          Pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise
          silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her
          shoulders.

</b>           Absolutely.
          The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo
          pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up
          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person
          in America.

          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red
          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters
          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their
          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens
          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream
          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and
          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces
          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing
          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is
          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest
          party you could ever go to.

                         

<b>          INT. LIMO - NIGHT

          Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers
          press their faces against the windows trying to make out who
          is inside. Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with
          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.

                         

<b>          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT
</b>
          The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.
          He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.
          Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm
          up to shield her eyes. It's too much.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>           (in her ear)
           This is your night. None of this
           would be possible without you.
          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks
          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic
          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is
          that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and
          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.
          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and
          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved
          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy
          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds
          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.

          toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.

                         

<b>          INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

          The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of
          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the
          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin
          to dim. The overture begins--
          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade
          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers
          old melody's rings in her ears.
          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain
          with Pamela.
          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,
          humming, sad, happy, joyous.
          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices
          of Bert and Jane -
          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--

          And then an image from the film:
          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined
          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.
          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.
          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her
          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud
          but people are noticing, looking at her.
          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She
          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.

<b>                          WALT
</b>           It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's
           alright. Mr Banks is going to be
           all right. I promise.
          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's
          all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I

          We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the
          film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are
          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent
          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to
          mouth along with the lyrics.
          And in her head one final image appears.
          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,
          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken
          understanding of what is to come, before his close with
          tiredness.
