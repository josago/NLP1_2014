</b>                    Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel
                    is really the great white whale of
                    snitches, then the mob is looking to
                    put all kinds of bullets into his
                    ass and pour some serious psychotics
                    into the mix to do just that. So
                    what real incentive is there to track
                    him on something as small-time as a
                    skip trace, when it's putting you
                    and yours in the path of severe pain
                    and suffering and an almost certain
                    prelude to doom.

</b><b>          INT. NOMAD HOTEL ROOM -- LOWER FLOOR
</b><b>          
</b>          The figure crosses the room, pouring the seltzer onto a towel.
          He kneels down, dabbing a spot on the carpet, fresh spill,
          deep red, indelible.. The seltzer doesn't bring it up. The
          stain remains, smeared now but unmistakable...blood.
<b>          
</b>          The figure stands. In the bathroom behind him, we see a body,
          male, late-50's, trussed up, hung by his feet over the tub
          and bled out. The figure walks in, takes a Polaroid, turns
          it upside down near the man's face and fires off a photo.
<b>          
</b>          He crosses back into the bedroom. The resulting photo is
          tucked into the corner of a dresser mirror as it develops.
          As the figure sits, WE PAN OVER TO REVEAL:
<b>          
</b>          LAZLO SOOT: world class assassin slash master of disguise.
          The slowly developing polaroid depicts the same face that we

          appliances on his face, smoothing, sealing...
<b>          
</b>          He takes up a small micro-cassette recorder, rewinds, pushes
          play. A butler's uniform, steamed and pressed, hangs on the
          door. He takes it down and begins changing into it.

<b>          
</b>          A muffled gunshot sounds. The recorder abruptly shuts off.
          Soot, gazing at his reflection now, rewinds the recorder,
          replays, listens, gauging the man's vocal patterns-- rough
          Baltic accent, throaty warble, excessive smoke & booze
          exposure, tracheal damage. Tough to match. He rehearses one.

          smokestack, puffing three at once, bellows-like lungfuls--
          He grabs an aerosol can from the same bureau, strafes the
          back of his throat, pops the tops on the bottles of Jack,
          kills them both, gags, sputters, recovers, adjusts himself.
          Suddenly, the phone begins to ring. Soot stops, stares.

</b>          Elmore sits up in the sub-zero shallows of Lake Tahoe with a
          start, stripped naked, shaking uncontrollably, his skin a
          deep bruised blue. Dull pain quickly defines-- pinpoints,
          bores in, bone deep...Death can't hurt this much.
<b>          
</b>          He gets his breathing under control, the onset of hypothermia
          turning his fingertips black-- his left hand, lighter three
          digits-- he looks, comprehension sparks but can't catch-- he
          stares impassively at the ragged space, for the moment, he
          doesn't seem to mind their absence. He gropes the side of
          his head, bullet-graze, blood congealed by the cold, the
          concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind.
<b>          
</b>          He crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up. He
          reaches the sand, unable to pull himself up any further. He
          turns back, sees the bodies of Deeks and Dupree, face down,
          the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them...
