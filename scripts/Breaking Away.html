</b>
          A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation.
          Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the
          road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it
          through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys
          walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their
          walk. MIIï¿½ is singing. The others are humming along. The
          melody of the song of "0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie"
          but it's a loose version.

</b>          By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is
          handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER
          is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a
          large trophy.

</b>          The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More
          and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed
          by them. They have to climb over some.

          an architectural mixture of old manor house and modern motel.
          The college kids are outside on the lawns. Some are reading.

          Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is
          moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on
          the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running

          gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep
          from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give'
          Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.

          challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two
          Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning
          the car.

          you ran over a samurai's Frisbee
          he had to commit suicide.
          Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The
          two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road.
          The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop,
          but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the
          Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again
          Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having
          scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in
          the direction he came from.

          Mike sees him. It's clear he wishes he didn't. Moocher
          resigns himself to the inevitable. Starts wrapping a
          handkerchief around his fist. Cyril is cringing.

          A bunch of Rod's cronies sitting nearby-laughs. They crowd
          in around the cutters. Cyril and Moocher look at Mike for
          guidance. Mike is on the spot. It's not that he's afraid
          of a fight, it's just that he's on a foreign turf.

          This is all Moocher needs. He hits Rod right in the tray
          Spilling the drinks all over him. Rod falls back knocking
          the table down. His friends jump up to his aid. Our guys
          are surrounded. The only opening is the cafeteria line.
          Mike is hit and falls back knocking down a tail row of plates,
          saucers, cups. Cyril is swinging the bowling ball around
          himself for protection. More rows of plates fall as the
          ball hits-them. The College Guys, led by Rod are trying to
          advance but our guys are throwing plates and maybe even food
          at them. The College Guys are throwing back what they can.
          Cyril's ball flies off and hits somebody in the stomach.
          By now its a free-for-all.

          you feel compelled to compete with
          the kids from the town then you
          will do it in a different arena.
          I am looking at a plan to open
          our intramural program to them.
          And as a starting point, in
          consultation with Mr. Armstrong,
          we have decided to expand the
          field of this year's Little 500
          to include a team from the town.

          is trapped. The 3rd Italian puts on his brakes. Dave puts
          on his to avoid running into him. As his speed slows down
          the 2nd Italian sticks his pump into Dave's rear wheel. Dave
          sees all this. In the split second that it takes, he sees
          it all. His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road
          falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The
          4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave. He seems
          genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues.
          He shouts after his teammates. He's a little angry.

          wins and as he does he turns and fives the "Italian finger"
          to his three buddies. He's still angry at them. Cyril,
          Mike and Moocher look for Dave. The crowd is cheering.

          All the guys are riding in silence. Dave is crushed by his
          shattered Italian dream. Mendelsohn's Italian Symphony is
          playing: the second movement. They drive past the finish
          line of the race. The big cloth sign "FINISH" is still up
          fluttering in the wind. A man is taking it down. Everybody
          else is gone. Dave looks on heartbroken.

<b>          ANGLE ON DAVE AND THE GIRL
</b>          They're riding double on Dave's bicycle. She's carrying his
          books. The book on top is Beginning French.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          French is my major. It's just my
          first year, of course. Have you
          ever seen Le Tour de France?

          He gives it his best French accent.

          Not only his accent, but his gestures are becoming French.
          Riding toward him on his bike is Mr. Blase. He sees Dave
          and waves.

<b>          MR. BLASE
</b>          Hello there, big shot.

</b>          Bon jour, Papa.
          They pass.
          Mr. Blase turns and looks back. His face registers mixed
          emotions, but the overriding one is one of acceptance. Dave
          turns to the girl.

</b>          Je m'appelle...
