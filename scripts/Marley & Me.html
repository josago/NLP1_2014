          Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her
          and puts his paws on her shoulders. She presses his butt to
          the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub. She tries to

</b>          The choke chain. When your animal
          walks properly by your side, there'll
          be slack. If he pulls, it tightens
          around his neck like a noose and
          loosens as soon as he stops pulling.

<b>                         JOHN

<b>          MS. KORNBLUT

          step off with your left foot - I don't

</b>          Class? Even an unruly dog wants to
          obey his leader. Marley? Heel.
          And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more
          confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back
          on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward.
          Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park.
          She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process
          begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her
          face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but
          Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a
          walking tug-of-war.
          With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to
          John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping
          her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down,
          and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee.
          John and Jenny rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps
          up Mrs. Kornblut. She's livid.

<b>          MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
</b>          That's it! He's out!

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          He usually just does this with poodles.
          (looking at her bad perm)
          Maybe it's the hair.

<b>          MS. KORNBLUT
</b>          He's a bad influence on the others.
          Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes
          hold in a group - he has to go!

</b>          Well, that was fun.
          (to the dog)
          Congratulations, Marley. You flunked
          obedience school.

          No, no, I'm not doing that to him.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>          It's painless. And he'll be a lot more
          comfortable. It'll calm him down.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer?
          Because he'll have nothing to look
          forward to.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>          What're you talking about? There are
          plenty of other things that'll make him

          lots of things make us happy, but the
          only thing we really look forward to is
          sex. Runner up: the possibility of
          sex.

</b>          John, he's out of control. It's the
          right thing to do.
          John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed
          "goofy" that Jenny gave him as a puppy.

          Jenny at the wheel. John in the passenger seat. Marley in the
          back, his front paws balanced on the center console.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see.
          Sex is overrated.
          Marley looks-at him.

<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know
          that... so maybe the best thing is to
          just not talk about it.
          Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice.

<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          Poor son-of-a-bitch.
          A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins
          listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff
          of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto John's lap...

<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here...
          Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to
          catch the fresh air

<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          Least I can do.
          John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out.

<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          Here you go...
          John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole
          head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like
          he's drunk.

<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          He's so happy. He has no idea what's
          about to happen to him.
          Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open
          window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of
          the car.

          his front armpits are resting on the glass.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>          John, grab him!
          Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and
          scrambling out the window of the moving car.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          He's onto our evil plan, and he's

          As Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the
          window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand
          so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his
          tail... He trots along the pavement with his front paws...

</b>          Uh, little help here...
          John's stuck. He can't pull the dog back in the window and he
          can't open the door. He can't let go as angry drivers behind
          them are now starting to swerve around them. John hangs on

          John watches him move off, a secretary giving Sebastian a big
          smile as he passes. John sits there another moment, looks at
          his desk. A photo of him and Jenny. One of Marley with a flip
          flop in his mouth.

</b>          Jenny sits on the couch. Marley stands at her feet, with his
          shoulders between her knees, his big head resting in her lap.
          His tail hangs flat between his legs. His eyes are turned up
          at her, and he whimpers softly.
          Jenny strokes his head a few times and then, with no warning,
          buries her face in the thick fur of his neck and begins
          sobbing. They stay like that for a moment, Marley statue-
          still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll.
          John stands there, watching Marley take care of her. No
          words, just being there. A lesson here. Her head down,
          Jenny raises one arm up towards John and John goes to the
          couch and wraps his arms around both of them. We then...

          John and Marley tumble into a snow bank on the opposite side.
          A moment. But then Marley jumps up and wriggles in delight.
          John painfully unfolds himself, checks for injuries. Marley

          He'd been laying there on the bed behind Patrick. He looks
          at John, knows he's not supposed to be there, but...

</b>          His stomach twisted. He ate or drank
          something quickly, took in a lot of air
          and his stomach flipped. I got a tube
          down which let out some of the gas. I
          think i untwisted it.

</b>          For now. But once this happens, it
          almost always happens again. And if it
          does, there's not gonna be anything I
          can do. He's too old for that kind of
          surgery.

</b>          Hey Jen? why don't you grab a blanket
          for me, too.
          She nods, starts back up the stairs. John grabs a pillow
          from the couch and lays down beside Marley.

          He looks up and see that Jenny's brought a blanket. She lies
          down with them. John puts his arm around them both.
          Marley's tail begins gently pounding the floor.

          John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag
          his tail or lick his hand. He runs his hand over his coat -
          then over his stomach, the dog flinches.

          the tree that countless dogs have peed on, sniffs it, then
          looks around. John looks around, too. It's a crisp spring

          leans down, puts his nose on Marley's neck and breathes him
          in. Then he goes around, squats down so he's on Marley's

</b>          All lit up. We see the kids sitting by the fire while Jenny
          moves about the kitchen getting dinner ready.
          John sits there watching them. watching his family. The
          family that both he and Marley grew up in.
          He gives the fresh dirt a final, loving pat and then, as the
          last bit of sun goes down, he stands up, and heads for home.
