</b>
<b>	FADE IN:
</b>	On complete darkness.
	A SMALL DOOR swings open.
	A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the 
	length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a 
	gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the 
	frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind 
	it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to 
	pad down the tube s length.
	After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit 
	cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
	The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s 
	ears.
	The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a 
	door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
	The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
	The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, 
	but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on 
	the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and 
	dashes toward it.
	But an invisible force descends.
	The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its 
	body, crushing it.
	A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, 
	halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, 
	struggling against the unholy force.
	Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life 
	quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
	The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white 
	fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
	HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked 
	ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into 
	the rat.
<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>	In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the 
	Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer 
	screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with 
	the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry 
	framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips 
	coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a 
	complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his 
	screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts 
	slightly, then falls apart.
	Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the 
	cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard 
	with renewed vigor.
	Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s 
	fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on 
	and off, it trembles and twists apart.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Damnit.
	Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a 
	light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a 
	BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her 
	living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses 
	it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to 
	the window, getting interested. But when the brunette 
	reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window 
	and lowers her shades.
				SEBASTIAN (cont d)
			Damnit.
	Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. 
	He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at 
	the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big 
	red letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be 
	Working.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins 
	pecking away again.
<b>										 
</b><b>LATER:
</b>	The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm 
	clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his 
	computer.
	He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away 
	again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen.
	He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. 
	Nothing happens.
	He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a 
	reaction.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>				 (beat)
			I am a goddamn genius.
	He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on 
	the screen. He dials.
<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>	Digital phone rings.
	In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a 
	deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her 
	desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.
	The ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse 
	around and her screen comes to life. She click on a 
	telephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, 
	Sebastian appears in a window on her screen.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian, do you know what time it 
			is?
<b>				SEBASTIAN (SCREEN)
</b>			You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it 
			was waste of time.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			What is it this time?
<b>	INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM
</b>	Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer 
	window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the 
	young man sleeping face down.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Who s that?
	Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer 
	screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Not your business. Not anymore.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Touche.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			So you calling about anything in 
			particular, or were you just hoping to 
			catch me sleeping in the nude?
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I cracked the reversion.
	Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			You cracked it?
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Look at this. 
	Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the 
	molecular structure appears on Linda s computer.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Watch this.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			You sure?
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			91% sure.
<b>				LINDA
</b>				 (astonished)
			Eleven months with no progress and you 
			suddenly come up with it out of the 
			blue? How?
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			The usual. Coffee and twinkies.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			I hate you.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I know. You think you could hunt down 
			Matt and get to the lab early. I want 
			Isabelle prepped for a live test.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Yeah, I think I can find him. What are 
			you going to do?
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Well y know. It s daylight in 
			Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel
			Committee and tell them to get our
			prizes ready. See you in a few.
	ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda 
	crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Hey... come on.
	DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under 
	sheets.
<b>				MATT
</b>				 (groggy)
			What?
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian just called. We gotta get to 
			the lab.
	Matt bolts up.
<b>				MATT
</b>			Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, 
			did you?
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Give me some credit, will ya.
<b>				MATT
</b>			So what s the rush?
<b>				LINDA
</b>			He cracked reversion.
	Matt pulls his jeans on.
<b>				MATT
</b>			Wanna ride down?
<b>				LINDA
</b>			We better take our own cars.
<b>				MATT
</b>			You re gonna have to tell him about us 
			eventually.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			I know. It s just You re his best 
			friend. He ll feel betrayed.
<b>	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY
</b>	From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in 
	the harsh light of morning.
	CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security 
	fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is 
	surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire.
	The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight 
	into the warehouse.
<b>	INT. WAREHOUSE -DAY
</b>	The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space 
	and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, 
	and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the 
	lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the 
	warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16.
<b>				MARINE GUARD
</b>			Morning, sir.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Morning, Ed.
<b>				MARINE GUARD
</b>			Your team s in early. Something 
			special going on?
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. 
	Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A 
	laser reads his print. 
	Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN 
	Clearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE 
	Division:	CLASSIFIED 
	The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.
<b>				MARINE GUARD
</b>			Have a good day, sir.
<b>	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>	Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian 
	taps in his floor code.
<b>				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
</b>			Authorization please.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Caine zero zero two seven.
<b>				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
</b>			Authorization verified. Good morning, 
			Dr. Caine. 
	The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes 
	below us and keeps descending into the belly of the 
	earth, the shaft goes down forever.
<b>	INT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR
</b>	We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas 
	chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a 
	specific animal, although no animals are visible.
	As we pass one habitat, something slams into the 
	Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then 
	SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen 
	animal cries. THUMP.
<b>	THUMP.
</b>	The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry 
	animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals 
	are seen.
	Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES 
	revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but 
	they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a 
	sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly 
	empty cage.
<b>				MATT
</b>			Isabelle ...
	The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the 
	Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The 
	Plexiglas begins to shake violently.
				MATT (cont d)
			Calm down baby. Calm down. It s 
			okay...
	Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and 
	pulls them down over his eyes. 
	THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in 
	shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the 
	Plexiglas door and reaches inside.
				MATT (cont d)
			It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not 
			going to hurt you. Come here.
	THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs 
	hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt 
	reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.
				MATT (cont d)
			Just hold still. 
	Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. 
	Blood erupts in a bite pattern.
				MATT (cont d)
			 Ow, shit.
	Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies 
	open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see 
	the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns 
	around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt 
	pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the 
	Corridor.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			You okay?
<b>				MATT
</b>			She bit me.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Yeah. She s become a lot more 
			aggressive in the last few days.
	Linda takes the goggles from Matt.
				LINDA (cont d)
			Go take care of that bite. I ll get 
			her.
<b>				MATT
</b>			And give you a chance to pull ahead? 
			Never.
	Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and 
	pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.
<b>	AROUND THE CORNER
</b>	A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. 
	We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS.
	Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a 
	haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed 
	though and something large and angry is throwing itself 
	against it. We can t see anything.
	A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, 
	wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.
<b>				MATT
</b>				 (ala Porky)
			Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting 
			simians.   heheheheh.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Knock it off.
				 (soothing voice)
			Isabelle!
	THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering 
	heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda 
	fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. 
	Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it 
	stops inches above the ground. 
	THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at 
	Linda s feet.
<b>				MATT
</b>			Good shootin , Tex.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			What s that make it?
<b>				MATT
</b>			I m still ahead. 6 to 5.
	Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from 
	the top of her tranquilizer gun.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			But I m catching up.
<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>	The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met 
	by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Can I have a word?
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Most normal people say good morning.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Don t you think you should test the 
			protocol on the liver samples before 
			you inject Isabelle?
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			How many tissue samples have we 
			successfully regressed? Hundreds, 
			right? How many have gone on to work 
			on the full system? None.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			That s beside the point.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			No, that is the point. I m not going 
			to waste six months of my life on an 
			outmoded testing procedure. This thing 
			works. I know it. I feel it.
	Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail 
	end of the conversation.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Fine. You can mop up afterward.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You think I m going to kill Isabelle?
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Kill? More like liquefy.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but 
			I m the project leader. Understand? 
	She says ...
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Yes, Sir.
	... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. 
	Sebastian turns to Linda.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			How did you ever convince me to hire 
			her?
<b>				LINDA
</b>			You said you wanted the beat vet in 
			the country.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Yeah, well she cares more about the 
			animals than the research.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Maybe that s why she s so good.
<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b>	CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As 
	it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and 
	reaches in, removing...
<b>	A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.
</b>	Sebastian peers at the vial.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Who da Man? You da Man.
<b>				MATT
</b>			As we pull out we see we are.
<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>	Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech 
	Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical 
	readouts, bizarre medical equipment.
	On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over 
	a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. 
	The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the 
	body to lots of machinery.
<b>				MATT
</b>			Protocol is hot.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Vitals?
	Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, 
	blood pressure, the rest.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Normal.
	CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in 
	a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and 
	pushes aside the sheet.
<b>				BOOMING VOICE
</b><b>			THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE
</b><b>			NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE
</b><b>			SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.
</b><b>			GOD HAS SPOKEN.
</b><b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			How many times do I have to tell you, 
			Frank you aren t God.
				 (beat)
			I am.
<b>				FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER)
</b>			Sorry, Boss. Forgot.
	Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the 
	Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You guys ready to roll?
<b>	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
</b>	FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE 
	WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. 
	They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists.
	The room is crammed with electronic and recording 
	equipment. A handful of monitors display different images 
	of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen 
	monitors vital signs.
<b>				FRANK
</b>			We are live and in color. On your 
			mark.
	Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. 
	Sebastian nods their way.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Okay. Roll  em.
<b>				JANICE
</b>			Okay. We are rolling record on videos 
			one through twelve.
	Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a 
	microphone. Recording.
<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>	Frank s voice echoes through the chamber.
<b>				FRANK (V.O.)
</b>			Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in 
			phase shift... one hundred twenty six 
			days, eighteen hours.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting 
			serial protein Caine One Two Five. 
	Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
	centrifuge nearby.
<b>				MATT
</b>			Maybe if you stopped naming them after 
			yourself, you d have better luck.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for 
			that keen scientific observation. I ll 
			be sure to include it in my memoirs.
<b>				MATT
</b>			A whole mention? And I thought I was 
			just gonna be a footnote.
	Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into 
	the vial, drawing up the colored liquid.
<b>	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
</b><b>				MATT
</b>			Okay.
	Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals.
<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>	Tension in the air.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>				 (to Linda)
			Ready.
	She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it 
	tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface 
	appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in 
	the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the 
	surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a 
	vein.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Propped.
<b>				MATT
</b>			Let s make some history.
	Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the 
	hypo from Matt s hand.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Nice try, Sparky.
	Matt relinquishes the needle.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. 
	Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The 
	needle remains in sight after it slips through the 
	visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, 
	releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid 
	twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. 
	It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. 
	Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of 
	color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed 
	up.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Elevated heartbeat.
<b>	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
</b>	Janice analyzes the screens.
<b>				JANICE
</b>			We re still in the green.
<b>				FRANK
</b>			Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal 
			range.
<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>	The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
	webbing of a bloodstream appears.
<b>				MATT
</b>			It s reacting.
	Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes 
	visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Do you see this?
<b>				LINDA
</b>			It s working. It s actually working. 
	Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to 
	appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Heart rate s up. She s scared.
	Sarah soothes her.
				SARAH (cont d)
			It's okay, baby. It's okay.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Subject began manifesting almost 
			Immediately. Protocol is reacting 
			quickly.
	Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She 
	begins to howl.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Subject may be in pain or extreme 
			discomfort.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. 
			Brain activity going through the roof. 
	The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. 
	The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the 
	inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror.
				SARAH (cont d)
			We ve got a problem.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			What? What problem!
	Sarah checks her monitors.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			It s her heart. We can see the heart 
			beating in the ape s
<b>				FRANK (V.0.)
</b>			I got an erratic heart beat.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			She s going into cardiac arrest.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Got the crash cart.
	Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			We re losing her.
	Her machine flatlines.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			No! It s got to work.
	The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in 
	decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Clear!
	Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt 
	of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief 
	moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			We ve got something!
	The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its 
	march toward,visibility.
				SARAH (cont d)
			Still. erratic.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do 
			it. You can fucking do it.
	Everybody s pulling for her.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Come on, monkey.
<b>				MATT
</b>			Do it. Do it. Come on.
	Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists 
	and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin 
	forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being 
	painted on before our eyes.
<b>				SARAH
</b>			Stabilizing.
	The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as 
	if it was discharging some stored energy.
<b>				FRANK (V.0.)
</b>			Brain activity returning to normal.
	The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda 
	hovers over it stroking its fur.
<b>				LINDA
</b>			Welcome back, Isabelle.
	Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move 
	that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it.
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>				 (beat)
			How is she?
<b>				SARAH
</b>				 (surprised)
			I think she s gonna be okay
<b>								
</b><b>	DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. HABITAT
</b>
	Frank, Matt, Sarah, Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise 
	and walk about the cage. She goes over to the other 
	monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Amazing. She's normal, absolutely 
			healthy. If you didn't know any 
			better, you'd think nothing had 
			happened to her.

<b>				MATT
</b>				 (ribbing Sarah)
			Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her 
			brain and trace her neural pathways.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Screw you, Matt.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Well maybe not right away.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			We should celebrate.

<b>	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
	The fanciest one in D.C.

	The entire eight person team sits around a round table, 
	drunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is 
	filled.

	Sebastian raises his glass.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			To the finest research team I've ever 
			known.

	A round of "Hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and 
	drink.

<b>	EXT. RESTAURANT BALCONY - LATER
</b>
	The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto 
	the restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning 
	against a railing, breathing in the night air.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Hey...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I thought you'd gone.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Where would I go?

	He looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling 
	lights of D.C. and darkness of the Potomac river.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Twenty years ago there were no 
			computers, no fax machines, no cell 
			phones. I was just wondering what the 
			world will be like twenty years from 
			now... if what we're doing will change 
			everything.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			A little "I am become death... the 
			shatterer of worlds"?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Something like that.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Since the day I met, all you wanted to 
			do was change the world.

	She puts her hand on his shoulder.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Listen, I know we've... I mean... well 
			... I just want you to know how proud 
			I am of you. I know it probably 
			doesn't mean a lot...

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Actually it does.
				 (beat)
			I guess since you were there from the 
			beginning, you know me better than 
			anyone else on this godforsaken 
			planet.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You're positively maudlin. You should 
			be happy. Do you have any idea what 
			you've accomplished?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Yeah... but I was working so hard, I 
			didn't realize I'd have no one to 
			share it with.

	Sebastian heads back inside. But he stops and turns back.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			I don't suppose we could turn back the 
			clock for a night and you could come 
			home with me?

	Her look says it all. Too much water under the bridge.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.

	He turns and heads back into the party. As he heads in he 
	passes Matt heading out. He and Sebastian exchange 
	"Heys".

<b>				MATT
</b>			What was that about?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Nothing. It's just... He is who he is. 
			Sometimes I just have to be reminded.

<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
	Sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the 
	laboratory.

<b>	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
</b>
	Sebastian paces back and forth, examining the habitats. 
	He taps on the Plexiglas of one. The cubicle explodes 
	with

<b>	BARKING.
</b>
	We see the Plexi steam up in one part, as if something 
	was breathing on it. As if a nose were pressed against 
	it.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>				 (a little drunk)
			What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell 
			me what it's like!

<b>	EXT. PENTAGON - DAY
</b>
	Flying over Washington D. C. , we cross the Potomac and 
	circle the five-cornered building, looking particularly 
	gloomy on this grey day.

<b>				SEBASTIAN (V.0.)
</b>			Six years ago, this committee 
			commissioned me with a very specific 
			task...

<b>	INT. PENTAGON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
	At the table are six men. A handful of senior military 
	brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to 
	the front of the room, where Sebastian, flanked by Matt 
	and Linda, is in the middle of his presentation.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			To successful phase-shift a human 
			being out of quantum sync with the 
			visible universe and then return him 
			safely, with no after affects.

	Next to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting 
	from the visible spectrum. It's hair, skin, organs and 
	skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Well, we found out sending them to 
			"never-never-land" was easy, it's the 
			getting back that's hard.

	Sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video 
	screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone 
	that used to be alive.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Every time we've tried to bring a test 
			subject back from phase-shift. 
			Cellular bonds would dissolve, the 
			primary DNA strands would decay. But 
			now...

	Sebastian pauses. Something's bothering him.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			But now...

	One of the senior advisers, DR. HARRY KRAMER, 
	distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.

<b>				KRAMER
</b>			But now?

	Linda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly.

<b>				SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
</b>			But now...
				 (pause)
			But now, we feel we are closer than 
			ever to resolving this issue. We've 
			been experimenting with a new 
			regression formula that looks rather 
			promising.
			A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.

<b>				GENERAL
</b>			How long?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Sir?

<b>				GENERAL
</b>			Son, as you can imagine, we are very 
			anxious to field test this tactical 
			asset. How long till you resolve this 
			issue?

	Linda starts to speak, but Sebastian cuts her off with a 
	look.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Shouldn't be more than another year, 
			Sir.

	Frustrated sighs all around the room.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Maybe sooner.

<b>	EXT. PENTAGON - DAY
</b>
	As Linda, Matt and Sebastian head to their cars.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Yo. Reality check! What the hell was 
			that about?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Keep your voice down.

<b>				MATT
</b>			The protocol works. Why'd you tell 
			them it didn't?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I wasn't ready for them to know.

<b>				MATT
</b>			But they're the oversight committee. 
			They're supposed to know.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I'm sure he had a reason.
				 (firmly)
			You did have a reason, didn't you, 
			Sebastian?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I had more than a reason. I had a 
			goddamn epiphany.

	They reach his Porsche.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			What do you think they'd do if they 
			know we could send a subject into 
			phase shift and pull it back out 
			again? How many seconds would it take 
			for them to take over the whole 
			project, bringing in their soldiers to 
			test the formula on. We'd have lost 
			control of it by the end of the week.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			It's their money, Sebastian. It's 
			going to happen eventually.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I know. But not yet. There's too much 
			for us to learn. I don't want my hands 
			tied by their political agenda when we 
			go to phase three.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Well, then... mind telling us how 
			you're gonna get a human test-subject 
			for phase three without the committee 
			finding out?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			That's easy. I've decided to test the 
			procedure ...

<b>	INT. LABORATORY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			... on myself.

	The team sits around the conference table. Their jaws 
	drop and they stare at him with wide eyes.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Are you nuts?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Was Jonas Salk nuts?

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Yeah. Pretty sure he was.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			And remember, for every Jonas Salk, 
			there are a bunch of guys who aren't 
			famous cuz they died.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			If we're that unsure, how can we 
			morally justify testing it on someone 
			else?

<b>				JANICE
</b>			Isn't it a little soon to be moving 
			into phase three anyway?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			She's right. We haven't even finished 
			collating the phase two research.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			We'll have plenty of time to collate 
			and cross-reference later. Monkey data 
			doesn't matter anyway. The only real 
			data is human data.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			You don't even know if any of the 
			protocols will work on humans.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			How are we gonna find out? Besides, 
			we've succeeded with a gorilla and 
			their DNA is 98% the same as humans. 
			And the 2% is not that significant.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian ... humans can talk, build 
			houses and cook in microwave ovens. 
			Gorilla's live in trees. That's a 
			helluva 2% if you ask me.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			We're all concerned. I know that. But 
			if we're gonna move forward ever, this 
			is something we have to do.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Why you? Why not one of us?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			The risks. I couldn't ask...

<b>				MATT
</b>				 (interrupting)
			What if we volunteer?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			What if you're too valuable to lose?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I'm Project Leader. It's my formula 
			and my call. The best way to express 
			your concern is to make damn sure you 
			do your best work. I'll want about 
			four weeks to...

<b>				FRANK
</b>			To put your affairs in order?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			To run some more reversions and tissue 
			tests and then we'll attempt the phase 
			shift. I'll stay shifted for three 
			days of testing and then we'll perform 
			a quantum regression.

<b>	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE
</b>
	A knock on the door.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Come in.

	Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind 
	her.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			What?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			In the past six years, I've never once 
			challenged your decisions, but this 
			... Sebastian. I don't think you 
			should do this.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You don't understand.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Oh please. How long were we together? 
			You must've said it a million times 
			... Nobody knows who built the lunar 
			lander. All they remember in the first 
			man on the moon.

	Sebastian shrugs and nods.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			But what if something happens to 
			you... what about the project? 

	Sebastian smiles.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Lin, trust me... nothing's going to 
			happen.

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda and Matt are in bed together. Matt kisses her way 
	up and down her arm. But Linda is distracted.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He refuses to listen to reason.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Can we talk about this later? I'm 
			trying to make love to you.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sorry. I just can't let it go.

	Matt props himself up on the pillow.

<b>				MATT
</b>			I know how you're feeling. Hell, he 
			and I've been friends since freshman 
			year.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			So how can we let him do this?

<b>				MATT
</b>			What if you were given the opportunity 
			to be the first person on ,Mars, would 
			you go?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			In a heartbeat.

<b>				MATT
</b>			What if they didn't know whether or 
			not they could get you home?

	Linda thinks about it. It's still tempting.

				MATT (cont'd)
			This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager 
			or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I 
			were him I'd do the same thing.

	Matt goes back to kissing Linda.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Let me ask another question.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Is about who gets to be on top?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Is the human race really ready for 
			what we're doing?

	Matt groans and rolls over.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Why do you always get philosophical 
			before we're about to get physical?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			No really. Is it ready? We're 
			barrelling down a road that begs moral 
			and ethical questions that I don't 
			think we can answer.

<b>				MATT
</b>			They said the same thing about the 
			bomb. They said we'd never survive the 
			nuclear age... but here we are.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			This night is still young.
				 (beat)
			I mean, when you think about it, it's 
			creepy. Do we really want to live in a 
			world where people can just disappear 
			in the blink of an eye?

<b>				MATT
</b>			We made our deal with the devil years 
			ago. Might as well stick around to 
			cash in.

<b>	INT. MEDICAL EXAMINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously. A knock 
	on the door.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>				 (his voice catches)
			Yes?

	Matt sticks his head in.

<b>				MATT
</b>			We're ready.

	Sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out. Then nods.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Okay.

<b>				MATT
</b>			It's not too late to back out. I'm 
			happy to take your place.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			No. I'm ready.

	Matt leads him into the hallway.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	As they walk down the corridor toward the lab...

<b>				MATT
</b>			Nervous?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			A little.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Ever tell you the one about Superman 
			and Wonder Woman?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I don't think so.

<b>				MATT
</b>			So Superman's flying around the city, 
			and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold 
			he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, 
			completely nude, sunning herself up on 
			the roof of the Justice League. I mean 
			she is lying there naked and spread 
			eagle. So Superman starts thinking, 
			"man... this is too easy. I could go 
			down there, do a little fast pumping 
			and be gone before she even sees me." 
			After all he is faster than a speeding 
			bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, 
			takes care of business so quick, you 
			can't even see him. Well ... I tell 
			ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised 
			as hell and says "What the hell was 
			that." And the Invisible Man replies 
			"I dunno know, but it sure hurt like 
			hell."

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	Sebastian shoots Matt a look.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You know, that could be the last joke 
			I ever hear.

<b>				MATT
</b>			C'mon, man. That's funny shit.

	The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified 
	HEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump. 
	Bah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed 
	only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table 
	inclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to 
	his body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein 
	up to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda 
	makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She 
	pats Sebastian on the shoulder.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			O.K. How're you feeling?
<b>			
</b>			Sebastian takes a deep breath.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Fine.

	Sarah checks his vitals.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit 
			elevated.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			To be expected.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			No reason for concern. He's ready. 

	Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face. She's 
	almost teary eyed.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Hey... it's gonna be okay.

	Linda nods. Back to business.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Start recording.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH.
</b>
	Janice hits record on the equipment decks.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			We're hot. All systems nominal, 
			Houston.

	Frank coordinates all the data being fed into the 
	computers. He pushes a series of buttons and speaks into 
	a microphone.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Okay, kids. Let's make some history.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	Frank's voice echoes through the chamber.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs. 

	Matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid. 
	Draws up 20ccs.

<b>				MATT
</b>				 (to Linda)
			Ready.

	Linda takes the hypo from Matt.

				MATT (cont'd)
			If the tests are any indication it 
			should work quickly.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I'll inject myself. If anything goes 
			wrong, they can't blame you.

	She hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away. Sebastian 
	stares at the golden formula silently for a moment.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			We can still shut down, Sebastian.

	He shakes his head.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Any last words?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said 
			something deep and clever. 

	Then... Back to business. He inserts the needle into the 
	I.V. Sebastian. Presses into himself and depresses the 
	plunger.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Injection was administered at
				 (checks watch)
<b>			... 18:23:47.
</b>
	The colored liquid snakes it's way into his bloodstream.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Keep talking. Tell us what you're 
			feeling.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Nothing so far.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Vitals are stable.

	They wait and watch.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Nothing's happening.

	Another moment passes by.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Human DNA structure is slightly more 
			complex... it's possible that it may 
			take more time...

	Another moment passes.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Maybe we overlooked something.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Recheck the protocol. It can't be non- 
			reactive.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Kinda like a firecracker with a bad 
			fuse...

	Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			Don't know if it'll go off.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Frank?

<b>				FRANK (V.0.)
</b>				 (from the booth)
			No change in bio-electric.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Goddammit.

	Another long pause. Sebastian concentrates.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a 
			bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's 
			starting to tingle...

	Excitement overtakes the room.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Okay... it's spreading to my back... 
			like, like a fever...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Here we go.

	Slowly the flesh on Sebastian's arm begins dissolving, 
	revealing the complex network of nerves, blood vessels 
	and flesh beneath it.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh 
			god. It hurts. I didn't think it would 
			hurt.

	The HEART BEAT thumps faster, accelerating

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100.
<b>			... 130 ...
</b>
<b>				LINDA
</b>			What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP 
<b>			TALKING!
</b>
<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Pain!

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure 
			180 over 100. ... 

<b>				CARTER
</b>			He's going to blow out his heart.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Prop the crash cart.

	Carter grabs the crash cart, rolls it in. Matt tears off 
	the I.V. leads into Sebastian's arms.

<b>				MATT
</b>			We've got to stop it!

<b>				LINDA
</b>			We can't!

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
</b>
	All the monitors are going crazy.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			Something's happening.

	Frank leans into the microphone.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Listen up! Electric activity 
			increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves 
			are through the roof.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			I didn't think the human brain could 
			spike that high.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Maybe it can't.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	Sebastian screams in dire pain. He struggles against his 
	restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass. 
	It's like something's eating away at him. Gruesome. The 
	yells become louder and more painful to hear.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!

	The muscular system begins to dissolve, leaving a 
	struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels 
	and stuffed with the major organs. The beating heart, the 
	heaving lungs.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Pulse is 180 .... holding stable. 

	Screaming.... Then the organs go. Then the blood vessels. 
	Leaving only a skeleton howling in pain. The jawbones 
	spread wide ... Screaming... screaming...

<b>				CARTER
</b>			 Holy shit.

	Then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones, 
	the skeleton evaporates into nothingness.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Pulse is dropping. 170..
<b>			150 .... 160..
</b>
	There is NOTHING left of Sebastian Caine.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
<b>			18:26.
</b>
	The screaming continues and the restraints continue to 
	twist and turn. Suddenly the restraints go limp.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Is he dead?

	Linda checks the readouts.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			No. He passed out from the trauma.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110 
			... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over 
<b>			75.
</b>
	A long beat as everybody's eyes stare at the instruments.

<b>				FRANK (V.O.)
</b>			Electrical activity is stabilizing.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Pulse steady at 70.

	A long beat.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Un-fucking-believable.

	A reverent pause as Linda runs her fingers over what 
	would be his skin. Small electrical charge dance around 
	her fingertips. She gasps.

<b>				LINDA
</b>				 (whispers in his ear)
			You did it, Sebastian. You're the 
			first.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Let's get him into recovery.

<b>								
</b><b>	DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER
</b>
	The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the 
	end of the Hallway of Habitats.

	On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's 
	invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery 
	pound out a dulling rhythm.

	Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the 
	room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a 
	seat by Linda. She wakes with a start.

<b>				MATT
</b>			S'okay. You nodded off.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			His breathing's hypnotic. How long's 
			it been?

<b>				MATT
</b>			Seventeen hours.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Where are the others?

<b>				MATT
</b>			In the lab crunching numbers. We've 
			got enough data there for two 
			lifetimes of research.

	Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I keep looking at that hole, wondering 
			if he's really there.

	She notices something out of the corner of his eye. The 
	sheet twitches.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Did you see...

	The sheet twitches again.

<b>				MATT
</b>			He may be coming out of it.

	Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the 
	sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			The lights! Turn off the goddamn 
			lights! Ah Christ!

	Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian. Matt rushes to 
	the wall and turns off the lights. Darkness. The room is 
	lit by the glow of machinery.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			I can't... I can't close my eyes. I 
			can't close my eyes.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Your eyelids are transparent.

	The sheets slowly stop thrashing.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			So I ... I'm...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Yes.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel 
			them...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Your arms ... your whole body... It 
			worked, Sebastian. It worked.

	The sheet rises and slips away. The wires, seemingly 
	connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and 
	then fall away one-by-one. The monitors all go dead.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Mirror. I ... I want to see.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Over here in the corner.

	Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a 
	mirror and sink. We push in on the mirror. No reflection. 
	Suddenly it fogs up ... Sebastian's breath. A finger 
	tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no 
	finger. The sink faucet twists on and water runs. It cups 
	into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing 
	against the surface of Sebastian's face. Beads of water 
	cling to his f ace, outlining it I shape f or a moment 
	before dripping away.

				MATT (cont'd)
			What was it like?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I ... It's hard to think.

	Sebastian's voice is now behind him. Matt turns around.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			The transformation... I remember every 
			molecule in my body shattering.

<b>				MATT
</b>			It was painful?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			At first... but then everything went 
			black. I couldn't see or hear or feel 
			anything. It was all just black... 
			like I wasn't connected.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Your system received quite a shock.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			At least my senses are starting to 
			return... You're wearing your 
			Shalimar, aren't you?

	Linda realizes that he's standing very close by. Her hair 
	lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales. Chills go down her 
	spine.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian.

	Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			This is weird. I'm looking through 
			myself at the floor. I'm looking right 
			through myself. I can't tell ...

	He bumps into a chair.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			... where my body is.

	A moment of silence.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian?

	No answer. Linda and Matt look at each other, slightly 
	alarmed.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Sebastian?

	An indentation forms on the bed a moment later.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			You really can't see me. Can you?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, 
			headache, body-ache, disorientation.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			No, just tired.
				 (beat)
			It's funny. I can see everything... 
			more than before... but I can't see 
			myself.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	Carter, Frank, Janice and Sarah work at various research 
	stations. The door opens and Linda and Matt enter.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Hey. How's he doing?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Why don't you ask him?

	Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt. The four 
	of them stare at the nothing.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Sebastian, how do you feel.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Not to bad, considering.

	They turn round. The voice is coming from behind them. 
	The group rises from their various workstations and turn 
	toward where the voice came from.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Odd, isn't it?

	A rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim. 
	Though it's a simple act, it feels somewhat ominous.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He can't close his eyes so they're 
			sensitive to light.

	Linda's explanation puts everyone at ease.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			So, what was it like?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Over here.

	Sebastian has moved. As everyone turns toward him again, 
	he can't stifle a slight giggle.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Sorry. Couldn't resist.

	His voice again come s from somewhere else in the room.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Well, I see the procedure hasn't 
			changed your personality.

	Frank pulls on a pair of THERMAL GOGGLES.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			No worries. I'm on it.

	THERMAL POV - Every body in the laboratory shows up as a 
	heat signature, including Sebastian. Frank points.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Gotcha, big man.

	THERMAL POV - The HEAT SIGNATURE reaches for a chair.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Boy, you people have no sense of 
			humor.

	A chair slides back from a desk and bends under 
	Sebastian's weight.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Show me. So ...

<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
	Frank and Janice shuttle the playback controls as a VIDEO 
	MONITOR re-plays various angles of Sebastian's phase 
	shift.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Stop there.

	Frank halts the tape.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Index that. That was when it started 
			burn. Epidermal reaction.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			Index Mark. 112125.

	Janice scribble the numbers in her notebook. Linda 
	crosses, nursing a cup of coffee.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			It's late. Time you got some rest.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Just a little longer.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Hate to pull rank, but you're my 
			patient now and you need rest. We've 
			got a busy day tomorrow.

	Heavy sigh.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Fine.

<b>	
</b>
<b>	INT. THE RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper 
	corner of the room.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			We've set up a thermal camera for 
			observation and I've arranged one of 
			us to be here 24/7 in case you need 
			anything. The team's gonna be on alpha-
			call alert for the duration. If 
			anything goes wrong, we can all be 
			here within...

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote 
			the procedure.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I was trying to be reassuring.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			You like this don't you?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			What's that?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Being in charge.

	It's clear she does. But she's certainly not going to 
	admit it.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Please. I'm just doing my job.

<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b>
	CLOSE ON: A video screen. A thermal lump lays stretched 
	out on the bed.

	Pull back to reveal SARAH staring at the screen. We are.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	A bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall 
	of Habitats, the laboratory and, of course, Sebastian in 
	the recovery room.

	Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You gonna be okay?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Fine. It's not like I have anything 
			else going on in my sad pathetic life.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Carter'll be in at six to spell you 
			and I'll be in by nine. Call me if 
			anything happens, okay?

	Through the glass wall, Linda sees Matt knocking and 
	waving her out.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			I'm fine. Go on ahead.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
	The rest of the team straggles into the elevator. 
	Yawning. Exhausted from the day.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Man, I'm tired. That was a long day.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Days only get longer from here.

	Linda catches Matt's eye. Gives him a look. "You coming 
	over?" Matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but 
	Linda. She smiles.

<b>								
</b><b>	DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
	Deserted and dark.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Late. Sarah rubs her temples. Her eyelids are heavy. 
	She's having real trouble staying awake. The buzzing 
	fluorescent light isn't helping either.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the 
	bed. We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet 
	shuffling against linoleum.

	CAMERA SLOWLY PANS toward the door, as if we, are 
	following someone walking.

	The door handle turns and the door pushes open.

<b>	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
</b>
	WE SLOWLY TRACK DOWN the Hallway of the Habitats. We hear 
	the sounds of sleeping creatures. A couple of them growl 
	at something unseen. The growling follows the invisible 
	something as it passes by.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
	The laboratory door opens and shuts again. Ghostly. We 
	see papers shuffling at one of the work stations. A glass 
	moves slightly.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Sarah reclines in her chair. Fast asleep, Behind her is 
	the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it.

	But a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had 
	just breathed on it. As the fogged part quickly clears, 
	we see the door to the observation room quietly open.

	ON SARAH, still sleeping. We hear a whisper.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>				 (whispering)
			Sarah. Are you awake?

	Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastian's.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
				 (barely audible)
			Hmm.

	Sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running 
	through it. And then we see her shirt move, like fingers 
	were tracing over it. Down from the shoulder to her 
	breast. Around her nipple. Sarah moans slightly, as if 
	she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. And then her 
	breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched... 
	softly... gently. Her breathing becomes harder, more 
	labored, erotic... and then she... BOLTS AWAKE. Bar eyes 
	wide with fear. She jumps and cups her own breasts and 
	looks around the room. It's empty, of course. She jumps 
	over to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room. The 
	heat signature isn't there.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are 
			you in here?

	She listens. It's silent. She tries holding her breath, 
	listening for his breathing. But there's nothing.

	Sarah reaches over to a microphone. Hits a few switches.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine?

<b>	VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE COMPOUND
</b>
<b>	- LABORATORY
</b>
<b>				SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)
</b>			Dr. Caine, please report in.

<b>	- HALLWAY OF HABITATS
</b>
<b>				SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)
</b>			Dr. Caine, report in please!

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Sarah waits. No response.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Shit. 

	She looks around the room. He must be in here.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this 
			isn't funny. I know you're in here. 

	Nothing. No response. Sarah waves her hand around, 
	reaching out, trying to find him. After a few beats she 
	stops and rubs her head.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			I must be going crazy.

	Suddenly, Sarah gets an idea. She quickly exits the 
	observation room.

<b>	EXT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
	At a wall storage box, she removes a pair of Thermal 
	Goggles and slips them on.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Sarah enters wearing the thermals. She scans the room.

	THERMAL POV - The room is empty.

	She pulls the goggles off in frustration, and when she 
	glances over at the video screen, she sees Sebastian's 
	thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room.

	Sarah sinks into her chair, a tad disconcerted.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING
</b>
	Linda and Matt finish listening to Sarah's story.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			I found him later in the lab, running 
			samples.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Why didn't you call me?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not. 
			I mean, I could've easily been 
			dreaming.

<b>				MATT
</b>			It doesn't sound like something 
			Sebastian would do.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			God, I feel so stupid.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I can talk to him.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			No. I mean...
				 (she torn, unsure of herself)
			It was probably nothing. I 
			shouldn't've mentioned it.

<b>				MATT
</b>			You sure?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why 
			would he do that, right? Just, this 
			place at night can be kinda creepy, 
			y'know.

<b>	INT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination 
	chair. Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his 
	head and arms. The electrodes seem to outline his body.

<b>				MATT
</b>			So, how was your first night?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't 
			close your eyes.

	As Sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his 
	jaw pump up and down.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Yeah? What'd you do?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Got up a couple of times. Knocked 
			about.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in 
			your cubicle. She said she called you 
			over the intercom and you didn't 
			respond.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio 
			on.

<b>				MATT
</b>			It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell 
			whoever's on duty where you're going 
			to. I mean, if something were to 
			happen, we'd want to know where to 
			find you.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I didn't think it was a problem.

<b>				MATT
</b>			It isn't. I just don't want it to 
			become one.

	Machines pump out EEG, EKG readouts. Matt studies them.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Readings are normal.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Next I want to run a VV and UVF 
			analysis of the platelets.

<b>				MATT
</b>			We'll have to draw some more blood.

<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b>
	Sarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. 
	She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it 
	tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. She 
	acts very self conscious.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			You okay?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Yeah. Why?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You just seem a little nervous.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This 
			might hurt a bit.

	The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
	searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
	then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin 
	bends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it 
	slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on 
	the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, 
			but are you... are you looking at me. 

	The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and 
	down his arm. His vein.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			No. I was looking at the clock. Why? 

	Sarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood 
	into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Just felt like someone was staring at 
			me.

	Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a 
	grease pencil. After a few beats the red dye in 
	Sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as 
	does the liquid in the vial.

<b>	TESTING MONTAGE
</b>
<b>	INT. MRI ROOM
</b>
	MATT slides Sebastian's sheet covered frame into an MRI. 
	Even though his head is not visible, it shown up on the 
	MRI scanner.

<b>	INT. MAIN LABORATORY
</b>
	CARTER and SARAH lower a harness into a water tank. 
	SEBASTIAN'S BODY displaces the water, revealing an empty 
	body shaped cavity in the water.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
	CARTER sips a BIG GULP and stares at a monitor which 
	shows two eat signatures in the Recovery Chamber, huddled 
	over a chess game.

<b>	INT. RECOVER CHAMBER
</b>
	on a chessboard... A BLACK KNIGHT takes WHITE BISHOP, 
	seemingly all by itself.

	Across the table, Matt leans back and topples his WHITE 
	KING acknowledging defeat.

<b>	INT. SPECTRAL LAB
</b>
	Dim lights. Janice and Frank both don eye guards. Frank 
	switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots 
	across the room. The beam distorts slightly in the center 
	of the room. As Frank widens the spectral pattern, 
	suddenly the beam splits into a million different 
	spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's 
	entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.

<b>	INT. MAIN LABORATORY
</b>
	LINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood 
	sample slides. She slips them under the microscope. She 
	takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table. 
	She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood 
	sample, squeezing more stain onto it. She looks up to 
	make notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT 
	ISN'T THERE. She looks around. It's on the other side of 
	her microscope. She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and 
	sets it down where it was before. She peers into the 
	microscope again and when she looks up... the Diet Coke 
	is gone. She looks around the room and sees it on another 
	table completely.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian? Goddamnit.

	We hear Sebastian's laughter echo in the room.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			You've no idea how much fun I've had. 
			I'm going to hate going back.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			That's what worries me.?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			How so?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			What happens when we turn the project 
			over to the Army. Ever wonder how much 
			fun they're gonna have?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Maybe we won't give it to them. His 
			voice comes from behind her now.

	We see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers 
	press down.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			I was thinking... tonight's my last 
			night. Ever fantasize about making 
			love to an invisible man?

	Linda pulls away from him.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Well, don't do it for me. Do it for 
			science. 

	Linda walks away. Sebastian laughs.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Grow up.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Oh well. Missed your big chance.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	A bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare. 
	Matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and 
	starts it spinning.

	A sheet drapes over a Sebastian's frame, straps across 
	his limbs. He is fully wired.

	Linda looks up to the observation booth.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Recording?

	Frank peers down at her from the booth, his voice echoing 
	through the chamber.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian 
			Caine. Currently in phase shift... 
			Three days, seven hours.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial 
			Protein Caine One Two Seven.

	Matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
	centrifuge nearby. Carter hands Matt a hypo. Matt jabs it 
	into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. Linda 
	sprays Sebastian's arm with dye.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Ready?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Not really. I was just starting to 
			enjoy myself.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Tough.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Okay, man. Here we go.

	Matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on 
	the plunger. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of 
	light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the 
	vein.

	Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Wait... something... something doesn't 
			feel right.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Heartbeat elevated.


<b>	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
</b>
	Janice and Frank look over the equipment.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Vitals still nominal..

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
	webbing of a bloodstream appears.

	Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible 
	... the shadow of a skeletal system.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I can't br... br...

	Sebastian begins wheezing.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			What's wrong?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			He's not breathing.

	Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened 
	eyeballs.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Subject manifesting.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Pulse erratic.

	Sebastian pulls against his bonds. One set tears off.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Carter!

	Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle, trying to 
	hold it back. But the restraints snap. The half-visible 
	man is screaming. He grabs Carter and throws him across 
	the room.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian! Sebastian!

	And just for a second, Sebastian is fully visible. And 
	free. He looks around like a scared animal and rips off 
	all the wiring.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian!

<b>				MATT
</b>			Get a tranq. Stat.

	Sarah preps a tranquilizer. Sebastian locks eyes with 
	Linda. He's lost, he doesn't know where he is. And 
	suddenly, he crumbles to the ground. Linda rushes over to 
	him and puts bar hand on his shoulder. Light bleeds from 
	his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's reverting. Got him on the table. 

	Matt, Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto 
	an operating table. Carter pulls himself up and heads 
	back to the group.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			I got no pulse. No pulse.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Start CPR.

	Carter locates Sebastian's heart, not a difficult thing 
	because we can actually see it. Carter's hand pushes down 
	in the air inches above the heart. We see the heart being 
	pushed and squeezed. Sarah slaps an air bag on Sebastian 
	and starts pumping air into his lungs. Sebastian's heart 
	begins to beat again, beat on its own.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Getting a pulse.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Holy shit. What happened?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you 
			hear me? How are his pupils?

<b>				MATT
</b>			I can't see his goddamn pupils!

<b>				SARAH
</b>			I think he's going into shock.

	We slowly FADE OUT to the sights and sounds of our 
	scientist- doctors working on Sebastian... And the 
	beeping of Sebastian's erratic heartbeat.

<b>									 FADE 
</b><b>UP ON:
</b>
<b>	A HABITAT
</b>
	The heartbeat continues. In the shadows, two Rhesus 
	Monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker. 
	Blood splatters against the Plexiglas wall.

	We FADE OUT AGAIN...

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the 
	Recovery Chamber. Inside the Chamber, Sarah and Carter-
	eye the various screens monitoring Sebastian's vitals.

	Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket. 
	She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as 
	Sebastian sleeps. Matt comes up behind her.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Just got the tissue sample results. 
			Cellular cohesion is stable.

	Linda exhales in relief. Matt puts his hands on her 
	shoulder. Pulls her close to him.

				MATT (cont'd)
			How bout you? You gonna be okay?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Guess so.
				 (beat)
			I was just thinking about the Apollo 
			missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and 
			Chaffee... What it was like for them 
			on that launch pad that day, thinking 
			they were gonna reach the stars only 
			to burn to death.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Sometimes the test pilots make 
			history. Sometimes the planes crash 
			and people die.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			But he didn't die, did he?
				 (beat)
			What if we can't bring him back? What 
			then?

<b>				MATT
</b>			It's just a little hitch is all. He'll 
			be the first to tell that he'll crack 
			it and I'm sure he will. It'll just 
			take time.
				 (beat)
			Listen, let's got out of here. We 
			could drive up to the old observatory. 
			We'll take some wine and go count the 
			stars and forget all this for awhile. 

	She pulls away.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			No. I want to be here for him.

	Linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and 
	takes a seat by Sebastian's bedside. A little hurt, Matt 
	heads down the corridor.

<b>	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
</b>
	Frank and Janice are staring into their coffee when Matt 
	enters. Matt crosses to the coffee machine and pours 
	himself a cup. He takes a seat at the table. They all 
	drink their coffee in silent vigil.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
	Linda sits by Sebastian's bedside, listening to the 
	constant rhythm of the machines.

	The sheets shift.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>				 (weak)
			Hey...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Hey...

<b>	
</b>
<b>				SEBASTIAN 
</b>			So I guess it didn't work.

	Linda shakes her head.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			You look worried. It must've been bad. 

	Sebastian's voice is weak and strained.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You almost died.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever 
			doesn't kill me, makes me stronger. 

	Linda smiles.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I should be making you feel better. 
			Not vice versa.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I guess if I'm going to be stuck this 
			way for awhile, I'd better make some 
			adjustments.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
	In a dusty shaft of light...

	A cotton swab.

	is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh-colored 
	cream make-up. We follow the hand as it raises the cotton 
	swab into the darkness. The swab strokes over the black 
	and the rich fleshy cream spreads, revealing...

	EYE LIDS of a closed eye.

	The eyelids part, unveiling...

	PITCH BLACK. Blink. Blink.

	No eye.

	Not even a trace of a eye socket. Just darkness.

	A COLORED CONTACT LENS floats through mid-air... hovering 
	before the eyelids. It turns and fastens itself to the 
	darkness between the lids.

	We PULL BACK slowly as Sebastian lifts a latex FACE MASK 
	and pulls it over his head.

	He checks his reflection in the mirror. He looks almost 
	human. Almost. A face, eyes, hands ... the rest of him 
	covered by surgical scrubs.

	We pull back and see the rest of the team looking on.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Not too bad.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			The latex'll limit the amount of light 
			delivered to my optic nerves.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You could almost pass for human. 

	Sebastian rises. He looks eerily removed from reality 
	with his cold blank expression.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Well, it gives you a face to talk to 
			at least, and we can all work in 
			normal light again.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
<b>	SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
	Carter draws blood from Sebastian.

	Samples are placed into the cyclotron.

	Matt peers through the eyepiece of a microscope. He makes 
	notes.

	Frank and Janice finish a computer simulation on a 
	protein strand. Matt looks over. They shake their heads, 
	no.

	Sebastian slides into the MRI.

	Linda examines a petri dish. She throws her pencil down 
	in frustration.

	Sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams.

	Matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking 
	like he's been dragged through the nine levels of 
	purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by 
	Linda and Matt.

	He crosses to his bed and collapses on it. Closes his 
	eyes.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			The testing's making me sick.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Could be the barium or the radiation.

<b>				MATT
</b>			You're physiology has changed and, 
			well, all bets are off.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I can't believe I have to spend 
			another night here.
				 (to Linda)
			Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet 
			up with that boyfriend of yours now. 

	Linda and Matt exchange a glance. Linda quickly covers.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Do you want me to stay?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			No. That's okay. It's just, being a 
			guinea pig is more work than I 
			thought. I'll be fine.

<b>	INT. RESEARCH COMPOUND - NIGHT

	Various shots of the empty hallways and deserted labs.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman 
	stereo and playing gameboy.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth.

	He slams the wall in frustration. He crosses to a mirror 
	and examines himself. He doesn't look half bad. He pokes 
	his cheeks. There's something about him that's a little 
	off, but only if you look close.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	A shadow falls across Carter's face. He looks up. It's 
	Sebastian wearing street clothes - jeans and a hooded 
	sweatshirt over his latex mask.

	Carter pulls of his earphones.

<b>				CARTER
</b>				 (surprised)
			Dr. Caine. What's up?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Just stopped by to let you know, I'm 
			going out for a bit.

	Sebastian turns back into the hallway.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Going out? Hey wait a sec!

	Carter scrambles to his feet.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
	Carter catches up with Sebastian.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			What do you mean going out for a bit?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna 
			go crazy.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			But you're not supposed to leave the 
			compound.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Why not?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			That's the rule.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Yes, but I made that rule. It's my 
			rule and I'm changing it.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			You can't just change it.

	Sebastian hits the elevator button. The doors open.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Carter, I was suppose to be like this 
			for three days. Three fucking days and 
			I'll be damned if I'm going to spend 
			the rest of my life as a prisoner in 
			this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going 
			out. I'll be back in a couple of 
			hours. Okay?

	The elevator doors close with Sebastian inside. Shit.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Shit.

	Carter runs down the corridor.

<b>	INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Carter picks up the phone and dials.

	A beat then.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem.

<b>	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	The elevator doors open and Sebastian pushes past the 
	Marine Guard.

<b>				MARINE GUARD
</b>			Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile? 

	Sebastian keeps his face turned away as he crosses to his 
	Porsche.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Yeah, well. You know how it in 
			sometimes.

<b>				MARINE GUARD
</b>			You got that right, sir. I was 
			beginning to worry 'cause your car 
			hadn't moved.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Thanks, but everything's cool. 

	Sebastian starts his car. It chugs a few times before 
	turning over and speeding out of the warehouse.

<b>	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	The door opens and Sebastian switches on the lights.

	He looks around his apartment and sighs. It's good to be 
	home.

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Sebastian enters the bedroom, clicking on the light. He 
	looks at the ceiling, "You Should Be Working", and 
	smiles.

<b>	INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING, PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda and Matt each rush to their respective cars.

<b>				MATT
</b>			He could be anywhere. Hell he could be 
			right behind us.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna 
			swing by his place, just in case.

<b>				MATT
</b>			See you there.

	Matt tries to give her a quick pack. Linda backs away.

<b>				LINDA
</b>				 (quietly, looking around)
			I don't want him to see.

<b>				MATT
</b>				 (looking around too)
			What a mess.

	They get in their cars.

<b>	INT. SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an 
	overnight duffle. He crosses to his bookcase and pulls 
	out some books and throws them into the bag.

	But as he does, he notices a light come on in the window 
	across the courtyard. Sebastian turns off his bedroom 
	light and moves toward the window. He peers across the 
	courtyard into the Brunette's apartment.

	He watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room 
	from her front hallway. She drops her keys on the table 
	and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the 
	window. Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she 
	pulls her blinds shut.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Shit.

	Frustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then 
	stops. Something has occurred to him.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Don't even think it...

	He looks down and notices his hand is trembling. His 
	breathing is a little heavy. A little nervous. He catches 
	a glimpse at himself in the mirror.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
				 (almost whispering)
			Once...just once.

	The Brunette's living room light switches off and the 
	bathroom light switches on. We see him fighting an 
	internal battle and we see him lose it. He grabs a hold 
	of his hand and peels the latex skin off.

<b>	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda drives Sebastian's apartment. She spots his black 
	Porsche in the parking lot. She pulls over to the curb, 
	jumps out of her car and heads into the building.

<b>	INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Wearing just a robe, the brunette turns on her shower. 
	The doorbell rings. With a frustrated sigh, the brunette 
	rises.

<b>	AT THE FRONT DOOR
</b>
	She peers through the peep hole. No one's there. But as 
	she turns she hears the doorbell again. She opens the 
	door, steps out into the hallway and looks around. Empty. 
	Puzzled she heads back inside her apartment.

	We follow her as she crosses to her bedroom, but a moment 
	later, the bedroom door closes on its own.

	We hear a SCREAM come from the other side. Then another. 
	Then a muffled struggled. And we...

<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. HALLWAY, SEBASTIAN BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's 
	door. She knocks. Waits. No answer. She knocks again. 
	Waits.

	And then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes 
	the door open.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian?

<b>	INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda pushes through the living room, into the bedroom.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian?

	She notices that the bathroom light is on.

<b>	BATHROOM
</b>
	On the floor she finds Sebastian's clothing and on the 
	vanity she sees his latex face and hands.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Oh shit.

	She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No. 
			He's taken his make-up off. I don't 
			know...He must be outside somewhere.
			I don't know where he went. I'm coming 
			back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed 
			to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM! 
			We're going on alpha call.  I want 
			everyone at the lab now. We're gonna 
			need thermal visors and we may need 
			tranqs.

	As she hangs up the phone, and heads out. The CAMERA 
	doesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and 
	out the window. As we cross the courtyard, we begin to 
	hear muffled cries of terror. We hold on the Brunette's 
	window as we...

<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	The bedroom door opens and we see the Brunette, nude and 
	curled up on the bed, sobbing. We follow the sounds of 
	heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment. The 
	door opens and we push out into the hallway. We can see 
	indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR BY SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT
</b>
	The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside. The doors 
	close shut behind her. A beat later we see the 
	indentations of footsteps come around the corner. We 
	follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into...

<b>	INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	We push over to the bathroom sink. The faucet turns on 
	and the water starts running.

	We see the water cup under the faucet and splash against 
	Sebastian's face. His face appears briefly in the water. 
	Then the water slips away.

	For second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear 
	something far worse. He's laughing. Nervous laughter.

<b>	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Matt hands out thermal goggles, while Frank loads and 
	passes out tranquilizer guns.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			What are the tranqs for?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Use your imagination.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			Are you saying he's dangerous?

<b>				MATT
</b>			We're just saying we need to be 
			cautious.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			The Metro stops running after midnight 
			and he's on foot, so he can't have 
			gotten too far.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Look, this isn't a monkey we're 
			talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't 
			you think you're over reacting?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			This program is classified. If he's 
			out there it means someone might find 
			out about him. He could destroy the 
			whole program.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out. 

	They all turn around. At the door is Sebastian, back in 
	his latex outfit.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Where the hell have you been?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I got a little stir crazy, so I went 
			to my apartment to pick up some stuff.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Bullshit! I went to your apartment and 
			I happen to know you did a helluva lot 
			more than pick some stuff up.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			What are you talking about?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You, of all people How could you? 

	Caught dead to rights, Sebastian sinks into his chair. He 
	thinks she knows.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You put yourself and this project at 
			risk.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Just what did you see in my apartment?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I saw your face and your clothes.

<b>				MATT
</b>			It was bad enough you left without an 
			escort, but to take off the...
				 (he motions to his face)
			out in public?

	Sebastian realizes that they don't know.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Don't make a mountain out of molehill. 
			I didn't let anyone see me.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			That's not good enough. When you're 
			outside the lab there are a thousand 
			variables none of us can control. It's 
			just not safe for you to be out there.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to 
			be some kind of prisoner.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You volunteered for this, Sebastian. 
			You knew going in there could be 
			consequences.
				 (beat)
			For the security of this project, I'm 
			gonna have to ask you to confine 
			yourself to the compound.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's 
			my decision to make.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You're right. It's your decision. But 
			if you leave the compound again, I'll 
			notify the oversight committee. Then 
			they can make the decision. You 
			understand?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Matt?

<b>				MATT
</b>			Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it 
			were the other way around.

	A long beat. Sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges Linda 
	with a nod and leaves the room. Linda looks around at her 
	silent co-workers, the goggles and tranqs still on the 
	table.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.

<b>								
</b><b>	DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	The Lab is buzzing with the usual activity. Linda rolls 
	up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing nothing.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Hold still.

	She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it 
	tight. She then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>				 (contentious)
			How much blood do you think you've 
			taken so far?

	The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
	searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
	then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Not enough to worry about.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Every day... feels like you're sucking 
			me dry.

	Linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger, releasing a 
	dye into his bloodstream.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			It's funny. All these years I've known 
			you, I never pegged you for a 
			megalomanic.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			What are you talking about?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			The shoe being on the other foot. You 
			getting to run things.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when 
			a classified experiment disappears in 
			the middle of the night, someone's 
			gotta run the show.
				 (tries sympathy)
			Look, I know how hard this has been 
			for you.

	He knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo, out of his 
	arm.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Don't patronize me.
				 (beat)
			And for the record, you've got no idea 
			what it's like. I get up every morning 
			and you people stick needles in me. 
			You bombard me with radiation until I 
			vomit. And then at six it's over for 
			you. You get to go home. But Sebastian 
			is still here. Sebastian can't leave, 
			or else. That's the worst part, you 
			know. Here I have this ... this GIFT 
			and I can't even use it.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Now it's a gift?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You're goddamn right it's a gift. And 
			if you weren't so goddamned short 
			sighted, I'd be out there right now 
			trying to master it. 

	Sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at 
	him. He tosses the hypo with the needle onto the 
	instrument tray and heads toward the door.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Where're you going?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Looks like I'm going nowhere.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests 
			scheduled today.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Do them yourself.


<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda enters to find Sebastian reading the collected 
	works of T.S. Elliot.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Want to talk about it?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			No.

	Linda looks over his shoulder.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			"We are the hollow men, the stuffed 
			men, headpieces filled with straw."

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Funny, huh? I've become a literal 
			metaphor.

	He puts the books down.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I don't want to fight you. I just want 
			what's best for the program.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I know. And you being right doesn't 
			make it any easier for me.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You can be scared. That's okay.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I'm not scared of being stuck this 
			way. With a little more make-up and 
			practice, I could...
				 (he motions to his face)
			... pass. Y'know, get by in the world. 
			But the testing...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You're talking like you've given up. 
			It's only been a few months.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			What if it's years? I don't know how 
			much more testing I can take.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER
</b>
	Sebastian paces back and forth, glancing at the camera.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at 
	an electron microscope's video display. On the screen in 
	a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and 
	more cells appear, filling the gap.

<b>				MATT
</b>			60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ...
<b>			85 ...
</b>
	The others in the lab listen. They start to get excited. 
	Janice and Carter leave their research and come over to 
	watch the screen.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			We've got it. We've got it.

<b>				MATT
</b><b>			93% ... 95%... 95%
</b>
	They wait. Linda points to a blank patch on the screen.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			That's all we need.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Come on, baby. Come on.

	But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out 
	existence, and then those around them also blink away 
	until after a beat, the screen is empty.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Full quantum cascade at 95%.
				 (beat)
			I'm sorry.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You're sorry? You're fucking sorry? 

	Sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against 
	the wall. It shatters.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Six weeks of this shit and you're 
			sorry!

	He grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage. 
	Carter and Janice grab him and restrain him. After 
	struggling against them a beat or two, Sebastian calms 
	down and pushes away from them and heads out the door.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			I don't blame him.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I'll go talk to him.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Leave him alone. He just needs to blow 
			off some steam.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
<b>									
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b>
	Sebastian lies in his bed, staring at the security 
	camera. The camera stares back at him.

	As if from a dream, we hear the Brunette's muffled scream 
	and cries for help. As we push in on Sebastian's cold 
	eyes, we can barely make out her face thrashing back in 
	forth in panic and confusion.

	Sebastian suddenly rises.

	He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel 
	on the underneath of the camera.

	He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of 
	the sponge cakes and begins munching. He hits the 
	intercom button on the phone.

<b>				FRANK (V.0.)
</b>			Yeah?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I'm going to the lab.

<b>				FRANK (V.0.)
</b>			Don't you sleep?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Frank eyes Sebastian in the monitor.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Okay. I'm here if you need me.

	He watches as Sebastian's heat signature moves toward the 
	door.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
	In the dark deserted lab, Sebastian pulls together a 
	circuit board, a computer chip and some wiring. He seems  
	be assembling something.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
	Sebastian crosses underneath the camera... just out of 
	its range... reaches up and using a screwdriver, unscrews 
	the access panel. He scans the electronics and attaches 
	two alligator clips to wires on the circuit board.

	Trailing a long length of wire, Sebastian crosses back to 
	his bed and lies down. He holds a black project box with 
	a button on it. He lies perfectly still and press the 
	button.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The video image of the Recovery Chamber flickers 
	slightly, before returning to normal.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
	Sebastian rises and begins to peel off his latex.

<b>	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
</b>
	Sebastian's POV - Various animals stir restlessly. A DOG, 
	visible, leaps against the Plexiglas, barking wildly. We 
	push further down the corridor.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Again, Sebastian's POV as he pushes through the open door 
	of the observation room. We see Frank sorting through 
	various computer readouts, highlighting certain coding 
	sequences.

	We push in until we are looking over Frank's shoulder at 
	the video monitor. According to the video, Sebastian is 
	sleeping soundly in his room.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
	The rewired security camera stares down at the empty bed.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Frank glances over at the video monitor. He can see 
	Sebastian's heat signature lying in the bed.

	Frank feels something on his neck. He flicks whatever it 
	is away with his hand and goes back to work.

<b>	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	The elevator door opens. The Guard turns around. The 
	elevator is empty.

<b>	INT. METRO STATION, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
</b>
	A Metro Subway train draws to a halt. With a cautionary 
	"BING BONG" its doors slide open. A handful of people 
	exit and enter. One man bumps shoulders. He turns round 
	to apologize, but there's no one there. The doors close 
	and the train pulls out of the station.

<b>	EXT. DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT
</b>
	A couple of pretty girls exit a bar and stumble to their 
	apartments.

<b>	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	One of the girls enters her apartment. The door half 
	closes behind her and then reopens and closes again.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING
</b>
	Frank's reading a book when Linda and Matt enter.

<b>				MATT
</b>			How'd it go?

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Quiet. He worked in the lab till about 
			10:30 and then went to sleep.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
	Close on the security camera. The wires have been removed 
	and the access panel replaced.

	Sebastian whistles a cheerful tune as he finishes 
	applying his makeup. The door opens and Linda and Matt 
	enter.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Ah, my two favorite people. Good 
			morning.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Good morning.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Why so cheery this morning?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You know some days you just wake up 
			feeling the world is full of 
			potential. Like your eyes have been 
			opened.

<b>				MATT
</b>			I'm happy if I make it to my coffee 
			machine.

	Linda hands Sebastian a disk.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I restructured the third genome on 
			your radiated protein strand. Thought 
			you might want to take look.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Cook up a batch and let's see where we 
			go.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I thought you'd want to take a look at 
			it.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me, 
			I need to have my head examined.

<b>	INT. STORAGE FREEZER - DAY
</b>
	Linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the 
	walk-in storage freezer.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I'm telling you, I know him. 
			Something's going on.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Think he knows about us.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			If he knew about us, he'd be angry and 
			that wasn't angry.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	Janice heads up one of the corridors when something on 
	the floor catches her eye. She bends down and takes a 
	look at it. Barely visible on the floor is a fragment of 
	a BAREFOOT FOOTPRINT.

	She runs her finger along the dried mud. It turns to 
	dust.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while EEG 
	leads hang suspended in mid-air, outlining his real head. 
	Carter analyzes the results.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			When you were a kid, you ever dream 
			about being invisible?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Sure... all the time.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			What did you imagine you'd do?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			The usual.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			What's the usual?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Hanging out in the girl's locker room. 
			Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Jimmy Margiani?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. 
			Back then, I was the size of a small 
			planet and made a rather large target.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Ever think up anything along the grand 
			scale?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Sure. World domination. Manipulating 
			stock markets, consolidating a 
			political power base. But those are 
			more recent fantasies.

	Carter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on 
	his latex facemask.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			And what if it weren't fantasy? What 
			if you were out there in the world and 
			could do whatever you wanted with no 
			consequences whatsoever. How far would 
			go? I mean... if it were real?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			I don't know, man. Out in the real 
			world... I mean, there's a 
			responsibility...

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Let's say you saw a woman with amazing 
			tits. Would you brush against them?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Hell, I try and do that now.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Human nature. So if you could get away 
			with more, would you do more?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			I read that in a survey at a major 
			university they asked college students 
			"Would you steal if you were 
			guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% 
			said yes.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder 
			if the world's ready for what we're 
			doing.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			So, Doc what did you do?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			What do you mean?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			When you were out.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I just walked around. Y'know.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Aw, you just walked around? Come on. 
			There's more, right?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Like what?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Man, I'd be walking up to people 
			saying shit like "This is God, go,get 
			a haircut." Or hanging out in the 
			changing room at Victoria's Secret.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Kind of sophomoric, don't you think. 
			Besides, it was late and I wasn't out 
			that long.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Well, did you see anybody?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			There was this one girl.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Yeah? And did you mess with her? 

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Naw...

	Sebastian gives Carter a sly grin.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Well maybe a little.
				 (beat)
			I tell you though, a man could get 
			used to it.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
	Alone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening.

	Slowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing. We 
	realize we are in...

<b>	SEBASTIAN'S POV
</b>
	Then ...

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Goodnight.

	Linda-jumps.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			It's fine. I just didn't know you were 
			there. Goodnight.

	As she leaves the Lab, he follows her down the hallway.

<b>	EXT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment 
	building. A few beats later, as if caught by a gust of 
	wind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own.

<b>	INT. APARTMENT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind 
	her. A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and 
	forth. It's locked.

<b>	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
	On a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to 
	the ground. The metal rattles back and forth as if 
	something were climbing it.

	We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window. 
	Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see 
	Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from 
	Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by 
	itself.

	But then through the window we see Matt walk into the 
	living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We 
	hear a shocked intake of air.

	He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her 
	dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat 
	and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the 
	buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging 
	kisses.

	Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses 
	his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to 
	her.

	Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and 
	Linda jump back covering themselves.

	We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the 
	fire escape.

	A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He 
	sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down 
	below.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			What was it?

<b>				MATT
</b>			I don't know. I don't see anything. 

	Matt picks up a piece of glass and examines it.

				MATT (cont'd)
			It's like something hit it.

	Linda picks up the phone and dials.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Carter picks up the phone.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Hello?

	Carter looks at the security monitor of the recovery 
	room. Sebastian's heat signature lies still on the bed.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at 
			him. He's right there in his room.

<b>	INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda breathes a sigh of relief.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye.
				 (hangs up phone)
			Phew.

	Matt pulls her into him.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Relax... it's nothing. Where were we?

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
	BARKING can be heard in the background. That horrible 
	repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese 
	water torture.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Be quiet!

	A photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles 
	atop a flaming candle. It ignites into fire, twisting and 
	turning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash. A 
	beat later water runs from the sink faucet. It forms in 
	the shape of hands and splashes against his face, 
	dripping away.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is 
			it who blinds me?" and Odysseus 
			replied "Nobody is my name". And the 
			Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody 
			is killing me. Nobody".

	The barking continues. A moment later the chamber door 
	slides open. We push down the...

<b>	HALLWAY OF THE HABITATS
</b>
	... until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking 
	dog.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.

	The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and 
	some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck. 
	The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the 
	barking stops.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Nobody's gonna hurt you. 

	The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes 
	limp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and 
	over until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door 
	swings closed again and moments later the door to 
	Sebastian's cubicle closes as well. The water runs in 
	Sebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half 
	visible hands.

</b>
	Sarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding. She 
	eyes it curiously and opens the cage door.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER
</b>
	Sarah stares at the empty chamber.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			You awake?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I am now.

	The sheets raise and drape off of him.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Notice anything unusual last night. 

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			No. Why?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Franklin Three. He's dead.

	Sebastian pulls a sheet around him. He moves across the 
	dimly lit room like a ghost.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			What of?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			His neck was broken and his windpipe 
			collapsed.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			How'd that happen?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			I thought maybe you could tell me.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Sarah... You saying I had something to 
			do with it?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			He was alive last night when I left 
			and he was dead this morning. And you 
			were the only one down here.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I was in my room all night.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Sarah sits with Carter as they run through the security 
	video tape. Matt and Linda look over their shoulder.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			That's all twelve hours.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He never left the room.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			A windpipe doesn't just suddenly 
			collapse. Someone or something killed 
			it.

<b>				MATT
</b>			You saw the tape. The man was in his 
			chamber.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Then we have a problem, because I the 
			cage was locked from the outside. That 
			means it was opened, the dog was 
			killed and the cage was closed and 
			locked again. Only a human could do 
			that.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Well, it wasn't me.

<b>				MATT
</b>			And it wasn't him.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Are we sure?

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda passes Sebastian's chamber. Sebastian's in latex.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Any big plans for tonight?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Really? Whatever happened to that guy 
			your were seeing?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's still in the picture. Why?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Being locked down here, I'm forced to 
			live vicariously. Someday you'll have 
			to tell me what he's like.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Maybe someday I will. See you in the 
			morning.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Au domain.

	Sebastian watches Linda walk away. He glances at the 
	camera and starts to peel off his face.

<b>	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	The elevator door opens. It's empty.

	SEBASTIAN'S POV - as we push past the guard and down onto 
	the street.

<b>	EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
	Empty street. We hear whistling. Splashes of water splat 
	out from shallow puddles,,as Sebastian walks through 
	them.

	SEBASTIAN'S POV - A car approaches. As it drives by we 
	see Matt and Linda inside, heading back to the warehouse.

	The footsteps stop.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Hmmm.

	We see the footsteps start to head back toward the 
	warehouse.

<b>	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	Linda and Matt exit their car and cross toward the 
	elevator.

<b>				LINDA
</b>				 (to Marine Guard)
			Forgot something.

<b>	INT. STREET IN FRONT OF WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	As we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles 
	toward the warehouse, we see Frank pass us in his car.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			What the hell?

	He breaks into a run. Feet splash water and he races back 
	toward the warehouse.

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
	Empty. The elevator door opens and we push out into the 
	hallway. Sebastian's POV

<b>	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
</b>
	We follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle. But 
	as he rounds the corner, he quickly ducks back. The 
	entire research team is in his cubicle. Sebastian slowly 
	approaches and watches as Frank takes down his video 
	board.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Pretty clever really. All it does is 
			recycle the signal. He flips this 
			switch, it takes a snapshot and that's 
			all we see.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Asshole.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			And you think he's violent?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			He killed a dog with his bare hands.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Dogs aren't people. Are we in any 
			danger?

	Linda doesn't know.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Either way, we aren't equipped to 
			handle this. We have to inform the 
			committee.

	Everybody murmurs in agreement.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			What if he doesn't come back?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			They'll go after him.
				 (beat)
			Who has tonight's shift?

<b>				JANICE
</b>			I do.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just 
			do what you're doing so he doesn't 
			become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll 
			go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot 
			the committee deal with it. 

	Sebastian's POV - He backs away and races down the hall.

<b>	EXT. DR. KRAMER'S HOUSE - POTOMAC MD - NIGHT
</b>
	The stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn 
	in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town. Linda's car 
	is parked on the curb in front.

	We break from a typical establishing shot and as the 
	CAMERA tracks closer to the house, we realize that we are

<b>	SEBASTIAN'S POV
</b>
	We hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some 
	bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the 
	Kramer living room.

	Through the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across 
	from DR. KRAMER. We can't hear what they're saying but it 
	certainly looks serious. Kramer puffs on a pipe and 
	strokes his beard, shaking his head.

	Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and 
	the three of them head toward the front door.

	We move away from the window and track toward the front 
	door. As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of 
	the conversation.

<b>				KRAMER
</b>			I'll call General Caster right now and 
			convene the oversight committee 
			tomorrow.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Thank you, sir.

<b>				MATT
</b>			What do we do in the meantime?

<b>				KRAMER
</b>			Just sit tight and wait for my call. 

	Matt and Linda head down to her car. Kramer heads back 
	inside.

<b>	INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	Kramer heads back into the living room. His wife appears 
	a the upstairs railing.

<b>				MRS. KRAMER
</b>			What was that about?

<b>				KRAMER
</b>			Just a little trouble at work.

<b>				MRS. KRAMER
</b>			You coming up?

<b>				KRAMER
</b>			In a minute. I have to make a few 
			calls.

	Mrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer 
	crosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver 
	and starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone 
	goes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to 
	get a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on 
	the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The 
	line's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in 
	the kitchen.

				KRAMER (cont'd)
			Hello? Hello?

	Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door 
	leading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to 
	it. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling 
	dead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings 
	lightly. Kramer steps out.

<b>	EXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT
</b>
	In the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to 
	the telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is 
	open and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks 
	around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his 
	pipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is 
	visible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and 
	the pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp 
	cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and 
	his cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out 
	his form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues 
	a beat until Kramer manages to break free.

<b>				KRAMER
</b>			Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!

	As Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. 
	WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling 
	into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one 
	splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped 
	AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And 
	because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two 
	arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface. 

	MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at 
	the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his 
	flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around 
	him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails 
	for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A 
	moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR 
	POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the 
	pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of 
	water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall 
	until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of 
	tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the 
	light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape 
	disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha 
	emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face 
	down in the pool. She screams.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
	Linda passes by Sebastian's chamber.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			What? No good morning for me? Don't 
			you like me anymore?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			That's okay. It's going to be busy 
			day.

<b>	INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	Matt sits across from her, twirling a pen in his hand. 
	They both stare at the phone.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			When did he say held call?

<b>				MATT
</b>			He's probably meeting with the 
			committee trying to figure out what to 
			do.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I'm gonna call him.

	Linda picks up the phone and dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me?
				 (inhales sharply - surprised)
			When? I'm so sorry.

	Linda blanches as she hangs up the phone.

<b>				MATT
</b>			What?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's dead. Drowned in his pool last 
			night.

	Linda picks up the phone again and dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yes, General Thompson please. Thank 
			you. 

	As she waits the phone line clicks dead.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Hello? Hello?

	She clicks on the hookswitch.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Let me see that.

	He tries it too. Same result.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Intercom's working, but there doesn't 
			seem to be an outside line.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR
</b>
	They waste no time getting to the elevator. Linda and 
	Matt step in.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I'll be right back with help.

	Linda taps in his floor code.

</b>			Authorization please.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.

<b>				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
</b>			Authorization invalid. Request denied.

</b>			Authorization please.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.

<b>				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
</b>			Authorization invalid. Request denied.

	Frank, Sarah, Carter and Janice man various work stations 
	in the lab. Linda and Matt enter.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			We've got a problem.

<b>	INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Frank's fingers fly over the keyboard.

<b>				MATT
</b>			How long before anybody starts looking 
			for us?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			There's no set check in procedure. It 
			could be weeks.

	A graphic of the elevator system pops up on the screen. 
	Frank highlights the security terminal. Frank hits a few 
	more keys. The screen reduces to a series of numbers.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You think you can got in?

	Frank rewrites a few of the numbers.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Already in. It was only a second level 
			encryption.

	The Security System specifications pops up.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			Some security system.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm 
			just extraordinary.

	Frank types a few more keys, and his eyes widen.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			But apparently someone is more 
			extraordinary than me.

<b>				MATT
</b>			What is it?

<b>				FRANK
</b>			There's nothing wrong with the system. 
			Our codes have been removed.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Removed? By who?

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Here's a clue. Only one code remains. 

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Whose?

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Dr. Sebastian Caine.

<b>	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER
</b>
	The team approaches Sebastian's chamber. Carter pulls on 
	the pair of thermal goggles dangling from his neck up.

	THERMAL POV - The chamber is empty.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			He's not in there.

	Linda enters the chamber. She notes that Sebastian's face 
	and makeup are on the sink vanity. Linda crosses to the 
	phone and hits the "PAGE BUTTON"

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us 
			where you are.

	She waits. Then...

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me 
			in.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian... where are you?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
</b>			You have no idea what it's like. The 
			power of it. The freedom. I can't let 
			that go.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me. 
			Tell me where you are and we can talk 
			about it.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
</b>			There's nothing to talk about. See ... 
			I've done things that can't be undone. 

	A long beep as the intercom clicks off.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian! Sebastian!
				 (beat)
			I want search parties. Thermal goggles 
			and tranquilizers.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	Linda and Matt, wearing thermal goggles and clutching 
	tranquilizer pistols, walk down the hallway, scanning 
	back and forth.

<b>	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE
</b>
	Janice enters the office.

<b>				JANICE
</b>			Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine? 

	Suddenly, Janice jerks back.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I'm here.

<b>	INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR
</b>
	Sarah scans all the habitats with a thermal scanner. 
	Listening intently.

<b>	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE
</b>
	Janice struggles with her unseen assailant, slamming into 
	walls and knocking into filing cabinets.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	Frank and Carter search the lab with their thermal 
	scopes.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Doctor Caine?

<b>	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE
</b>
	Linda and Matt knock.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian?

	No response. They push through the door. The room seems 
	deserted. Signs of a struggle. File cabinets opened, 
	drawers tossed.

<b>				MATT
</b>			This is bad.

	THERMAL POV - Linda surveys the room, spotting a slight 
	heat signature peeking from the corner.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			There's something over there.

	Linda moves toward it. Whatever it is its hidden from 
	Matt's POV by the supply cabinet. As Linda gets close she 
	pulls of f her thermal goggles to see...

<b>	JANICE -
</b>
	Her face blue, eyes bulging. An I.V. cord wrapped around 
	his neck. Linda jumps back.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Jesus. Oh my god.

	Matt rushes over. Sees the lifeless corpse.

<b>				MATT
</b>			What happened?

	Linda lowers the body to the floor.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			She was strangled. Multiple blows to 
			her head.

	Linda begins a medical check of the rest of the body. 
	Matt stoops down and examines Janice's face.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We got a big problem here.

	A lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor. 
	Both Linda and Matt jump. Linda frantically dons the 
	thermal visor and scopes the room again. Nothing. Matt 
	notices the lamp cord beneath Linda's leg. Points it out 
	to her. She sighs with relief... she pulled the lamp off 
	the table.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Get everybody to the conference room. 
			Now!

	Matt picks up the phone. Clicks the hookswitch. Clicks 
	the hookswitch again.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Intercom... the phone lines. They're 
			dead.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Gimme that.

	She checks the phone, punches some numbers. Nothing.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			It was just working.

<b>				MATT
</b>			What the fuck is going on here?

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	Matt and Linda head toward the lab.

	Linda suddenly stops.

<b>				MATT
</b>			What?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Shhh.

	Linda takes a few cautious steps. Senses something.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Give me the visor.

	Matt, suddenly concerned, hands her the visor. 

	THERMAL POV - Linda checks out the corridor. Empty. Linda 
	takes Matt's hand.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			C'mon.

	They move quickly up the corridor. See Frank, Sarah and 
	Carter.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Did you find him?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Janice is dead.

<b>	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
</b>
	Linda scans the room with her thermal scope.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			It's clear.

	Matt, Frank, Janice and Sarah step in, locking the door 
	behind them.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			The man has checked out of reality.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			What happened? I don't understand.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the 
			only ones who knows he exists. If he 
			gets rid of us, no one knows and he 
			becomes the most powerful man on 
			earth.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			But he's not a killer.

	They all look at Linda.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He wasn't. He is now.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Can you fix the elevator? Restore our 
			codes?

<b>				FRANK
</b>			It'd take hours to crack the 
			encryptions.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Right now that sounds like good news.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			So what do we do until then. Sit 
			around waiting for him to kill us off? 

	Everyone looks around for some leadership. Finally.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			No. We find him, before he finds us.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	The group moves quickly, passing under an air vent. As 
	they round the corner the vent slowly swings down and an 
	air disturbance drops to the ground.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
	As they enter...

<b>				CARTER
</b>			You sure this'll work.

	Linda sits down at a computer terminal, activates it.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			We designed it to help find the rats 
			we kept dropping in year one. They 
			were too small for thermal scans.

	A map of the compound appears on the screen.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Systems hot. Activating motion 
			detectors.

	Matt toggles a switch. Linda stares at a map of the 
	compound. Blips appear on the display... in the 
	observation room... in the Habitat Area and in one of the 
	corridors.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I've got movement in Corridor Six.

<b>				MATT
</b>			That's him.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	A shadow edges down the tunnel. It settles for a moment, 
	disappearing completely, then is back on the move. At the 
	tunnel's edges, motion detectors light up as the thing 
	passes by.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
	Carter checks his Tranq pistol & Matt rummages through a 
	locker.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Got 'em.

	Matt pulls out a pair of walkie-talkies. He tosses one to 
	Linda.

<b>				LINDA
</b>				 (into walkie)
			Check. Check.

	Her voice echoes from the other unit.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Be careful.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, 
			ready?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Let's do it.

	Matt and Carter exit. Linda locks the door behind them.

<b>	INT. TUNNEL
</b>
	Matt and Carter trot toward corridor six.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Linda huddles over the display, tracking the two.

<b>				LINDA
</b>				 (into Walkie)
			Take a right at the next accessway. 
			He's working his way back to the 
			offices.

	We see Matt and Carter on one of the working video 
	screens as they push down the tunnel.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	Matt and Carter move cautiously, listening for any sound.

<b>				MATT
</b>				 (Walkie - sotto)
			If we split up, can we trap him on 
			corridor eight?

<b>				LINDA (V.0.)
</b>			If he keeps heading in that direction. 

	Matt nods to Carter. The pair splits, heading down 
	separate accessways.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Going Thermal.

	Matt pulls the visor down over his eyes.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Linda watches the two separate and come around Sebastian 
	in a pincer move.

	Suddenly, the blip that was Sebastian disappears. Linda 
	grabs the walkie.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I lost him. Matt, I lost him.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	Matt makes his way forward.

<b>				MATT
</b>			He probably just stopped moving.

	But Matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps. Slowly 
	... approaching a corner...

	He rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far 
	end of the corridor. He levels his pistol, ready to fire.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			It's me.

	Matt pulls off his goggles.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Do you have anything?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Nothing.

<b>				MATT
</b>			How did he get by us?

<b>				CARTER
</b>			He couldn't.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Sebastian! We're here to help. 
			Sebastian.

	No response. They both don their visors and move forward 
	slightly. Carter holds up his hand.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			There. Behind those pipes. He's not 
			moving.

	Carter points. Matt checks his thermal. A red heat 
	signature clings to the wall.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			Doctor Caine?
				 (beat)
			Can you hear me?

	No response.

<b>				MATT
</b>				 (into walkie)
			We see him. But he's not responding. 
			The heat signature doesn't move.

	Matt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer 
	gun at the ready. He looks for a clear shot. The heat 
	signature huddles behind pipes.

<b>				MATT
</b>			C'mon... C'mon...

	The two slowly move closer. Matt finally has a clear 
	shot. He signals Carter. Carter levels his pistol too.

<b>				CARTER
</b>			Covered.

	Matt fires the dart at the heat signature. It bounces off 
	the wall ... Nothing there. 

<b>				MATT
</b>			What the...

	He crosses to the heat signature.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent

<b>				LINDA (V.0.)
</b>			He was there.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Looks like... looks like we're pumping 
			out heat...

	Suddenly behind him... CARTER JERKS THREE FEET in the 
	air, kicking wildly. SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR BY HIS NECK. He 
	gasps for air.

<b>				LINDA (V.0.)
</b>			I got movement again! He's right on 
			top of you!

<b>				MATT
</b>			No fucking shit!

	Matt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the 
	ceiling until he spends his dart rounds.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.

<b>				CARTER
</b>				 (choking)
			H...Help... MMmmphg

	Carter suffocates. He passes out. With a sudden crack, 
	he's thrown against the side wall. A large cut opens up 
	across his head and his body goes limp.

<b>				MATT
</b>				 (into walkie)
			Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Linda huddles over the display.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Right on top of you.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	Matt scrambles away. Running. Pipes burst and swing down 
	from the ceiling. Steam billows forth. Something moves 
	through the cloud of steam.

	Around the corner, Matt shoves more darts into his 
	tranquilizer.

<b>				LINDA (V.0.)
</b>			What's going on? Are you okay?

<b>				MATT
</b>			Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from 
			a head wound.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Linda watches the screen. Two blips, one traveling 
	quickly.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Matt, he's coming toward you.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	Matt takes a few steps back.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Shit.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Got outta there.

	Matt breaks into a run.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
	Linda watches one dot chasing the other, down several 
	corridors.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's close!

<b>	INT. TUNNEL
</b>
	Matt running, checking over his shoulder. Sounds of 
	footsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast 
	doors begin to close.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's 
			shutting me in.

	Matt rushes the doors as they slide shut. He doesn't make 
	it in time. The doors close with a resounding clang. Matt 
	turns and pulls on his thermals.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Where is he?

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Linda huddled over the screen. Tense.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's coming right at you! 

	Then checks the Thermal goggles. Several heat signature 
	dot the tunnel.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Where?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Twenty, maybe thirty feet.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the 
			place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must 
			be ghosts.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Linda gets a sense of forboding. She looks around the 
	room. Sees a heating vent in the corner.

	Beat.

	She grabs the walkie.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Those signatures ... they're coming 
			from the heating vents. 

	Through the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red.

<b>				MATT
</b>			I'm starting to lose resolution on my 
			thermals.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Get out of there!

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
<b>				FRANK
</b>			If the room temperature is the same as 
			his body temperature, thermal 
			visors'll be no good.

	Linda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door. 

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I'm going!

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Linda...it's not safe.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			That's why I'm going.
				 (to Frank and Sarah)
			Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to 
			the lab. We'll meet you there.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			But...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Do it.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	Matt turns to face the corridor. It's turning red. Matt 
	sees some movement in the thermal cloud. Opens fire. But 
	the thermal signature disappears into the heat. Matt 
	can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. 
	He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him 
	sweeping the hallway.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo...

	His voice keeps shifting. Matt fires.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Not even close.

	Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind 
	man using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He 
	sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes 
	it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING 
	LUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling 
	down the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood 
	coming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more 
	foam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and 
	FIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit. 
	Matt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			So... just out of curiosity, how long 
			has my best friend been fucking my ex-
			girlfriend.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You 
			aren't thinking rationally.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?

<b>				MATT
</b>			Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk 
			this through. It's not too late.

	The Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder 
	swirling in clouds behind it. Coming toward him.

<b>				MATT (CONT'D)
</b>			C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm 
			your friend.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I'm sorry, but I just feel that our 
			friendship is holding me back. I'm 
			sure you understand. 

	THE DOOR OPENS. Linda reaches through, grabs Matt. She 
	pulls him to his feet and through the door.

<b>	INT. TUNNEL
</b>
	Frank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down 
	the corridor.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			This way.

	They shear off the main corridor into the side corridor. 
	Carter lies crumpled up ahead. Sarah slides to his side. 
	Carter's head rests in a pool of blood. She checks his 
	pulse while Frank takes a protective position.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			He'll be okay.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			It's pretty severe. We have to get him 
			to the lab.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			He's got to be okay.

	Frank stands frozen.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			For godsakes, help me.

	Frank snaps to. Grabs an arm. The pair hoist Carter up 
	and carry him down the hallway.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
	Linda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them.

<b>				MATT
</b>			He was going to kill me.

	Linda pulls him close.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I know. He's gone.

<b>				MATT
</b>			We've got to got out of here.

	Linda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter 
	headed toward the Laboratory.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he? 

	Isolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Habitats.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Oh god. That's right between us and 
			the lab.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	Frank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			His pulse is faint.

	Sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top. Folds it and 
	presses it against the head wound.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold 
			this.

	She guides Frank's hands to the wound.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Keep applying pressure.

	Sarah pulls out a saline solution I.V. bag and slap it on 
	the rack. She fumbles with the needle as she tries to 
	find a vein.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Don't move your hand until I got back. 

	Sarah heads to the door.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Where are you going?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			This'll hold him but he needs blood.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			But...

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Supply is right down the hall. I'll be 
			two seconds.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Sarah, wait for the others

<b>				SARAH
</b>			If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on 
			the wound.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	Sarah exits the lab. Checks the corridor. Down at the end 
	of the cramped tunnel is the supply room.

	She swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while 
	glancing side-to-side and behind her.

<b>	INT. SUPPLY ROOM
</b>
	Spooked, Sarah bursts into the room. She goes to the 
	supply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts 
	through blood bags.

<b>	INT. TUNNEL
</b>
	Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying 
	with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, 
	Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando.

	A noise behind them. Footsteps.

	Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white 
	chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the 
	tunnel. But it isn't a human shape.

	Matt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws 
	fells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry 
	face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Ahh!  Shit!

	Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. 
	Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl. 
	Linda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which 
	collapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty 
	chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape 
	appears, still twitching.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Karl Three. Nice shot.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's let the animals out. It wasn't 
			him we were tracking.

	Linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq 
	gun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs 
	are soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from 
	her brow.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You okay?

<b>				MATT
</b>			It won't kill me unless it gets 
			infected. You?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Me .... Don't ask about me. If he 
			freed all the animals, we could have 
			dozens running around the lab.

<b>				MATT
</b>			So he could be anywhere right now.

	Matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud 
	mist. Nothing else appears.

				MATT (cont'd)
			What do we do?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors 
			and pray to God Frank can reprogram 
			the elevator.

<b>	INT. SUPPLY ROOM
</b>
	Sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door 
	to the fridge/freezer.

	The DOOR SLAMS behind her. She freezes and slowly turns.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Frank?

	She eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement.

				SARAH (cont'd)
				 (frightened whisper)
			Who's there?

	She listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's 
	starting to panic.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine?

	She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. 
	She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to 
	aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an 
	idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the 
	floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the 
	linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming 
	more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more 
	blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she 
	searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. 
	But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching 
	the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.

	Finally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She 
	heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper 
	in her ear.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			You missed.

	Her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. She 
	tries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands 
	struggling against the force.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me 
			go. 

	The arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			What are you doing? No!

	Sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me!
<b>			FRANK!
</b>
	Slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and 
	around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her 
	stomach.

	Sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			No... please. Don't do this to me.

	She struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In 
	anguish and in fear.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			What do you want?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You.

	The trigger pulls .... Pop!

	A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's 
	stomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly 
	she's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless 
	to the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is 
	the sound of someone breathing.

	On Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her 
	cheek..

	Almost sweet... almost tender. And slight indentation 
	runs across her breast and strokes down her body. The 
	sense of violation and vulnerability is awful. Sebastian 
	sighs.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I've always liked your feistiness. 

	Sarah's head shifts slightly. Her head shifts violently, 
	accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping. 
	Sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the 
	intoxication of power.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	Frank applies pressure to the wound, waiting for Sarah to 
	return. Carter's vital signs are weakening..,.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Sarah! Sarah!
				 (to Carter)
			Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you 
			let up... Sarah! Sarah!

	No response. Frank doesn't know whether to stay or go 
	after her. He starts toward the door several times but 
	can't leave Carter. Finally the door opens.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Sarah! I'm losing him.

	But it's Linda and Matt.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Did you see her?

	Linda rushes over to check on Carter.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Where is she?

<b>				FRANK
</b>			She went to the supply room. Carter 
			needed blood.

	Linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to Carter's heart.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			I said no one goes anywhere alone.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			She didn't listen.

	She-slowly pulls Frank's hand away from the wound.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			But...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's dead.

	Linda would love to cry about it, but doesn't afford 
	herself the luxury.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	The three of them approach the supply room door slowly. 
	Blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints 
	extend down the hallway.

	They swing open the door.

	The floor is covered in blood and broken glass. But no 
	body.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	Sarah, broken, is dragged toward the chair, eerily 
	jerking down the hallway... seemingly on its own.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	The three scientists follow the bloody footprints down 
	the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of 
	habitats.

	All clutch their tranquilizer pistols.

	The footprints lead past the habitats to Sebastian's 
	chamber.

	They see Sarah's body in the dim light.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Oh god. Sarah!

	The group breaks into a run. Linda pushes into the 
	chamber and falls at Sarah's side. Matt cradles Sarah's 
	head. They look for some sign of life as Linda fights 
	back the tears.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			No...

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Her too?

	Matt nods. Linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			This didn't happen. This hasn't 
			happened.

<b>				MATT
</b>			It happened alright. Now we have to 
			deal with it.

	Matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her. She 
	pushes him off.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Yeah? And just what are we supposed to 
			do now?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Now? Now you die.

	The three of them whip around.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's here!

<b>				MATT
</b>			Where?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian!

	Silence. The three cautiously move out. They stand back 
	to back, each one facing out. They move toward the door 
	of the Chamber.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.

	No response. They all their tranq pistols level waiting 
	for some sign. Hearing each other breathe. They slowly 
	move outside the Chamber into the corridor.

<b>				LINDA (CONT1D)
</b>			I don't know if you can understand 
			this, but what you're experiencing is 
			a psychological breakdown. This isn't 
			who you are.

	A beat.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I would say that what I am 
			experiencing is psychological 
			awareness. I like you being in 
			complete and absolute control.

	They identify the general area the voice is coming from: 
	Back inside the Chamber! They slowly move toward the 
	Chamber door. With lightning speed they slam the door 
	shut, locking Sebastian inside the Recovery Chamber.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You goddamn bastard! You goddamn 
			bastard. You're gonna pay for this. 
			I'm going to bring you back to 
			visibility and then I'm going throw 
			your ass in jail.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			You're never gonna bring me back 
			Linda. I never want to come back.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Fuck you!

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time 
			for old times sake.

	Linda slams her fist against the wall of the Chamber.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Don't listen to him. It's not worth 
			it.

<b>				FRANK
</b>			Come on, Matt. Let's go get the 
			elevator back on-line so we can got 
			out of this hell hole.

	Matt gives Linda a kiss...

<b>				MATT
</b>			He does anything, anything at all, 
			come get us. I'll be back to check on 
			you in five.

	Matt and Frank head off down the corridor.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Imagine you two, carrying on right 
			under my nose. Out of curiosity, what 
			did he give you that I couldn't?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man 
			than you'll ever be.

<b>	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	A VIDEO SCREEN shows Linda pacing outside the Chamber 
	door. The chair moves forward toward a microphone.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If 
			that's what you want...

	Sebastian TOGGLES the intercom switch OFF. We pan over to 
	one of the working video screens ... Matt and Frank 
	stride down the hallway. The chair swivels and the 
	observation room door swings open slightly.

<b>	INT. CHAMBER
</b>
	Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing 
	moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ... 
	stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead 
	Sarah.

	Then she sees it. The little red light on the intercom. 
	Its on.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...

	Linda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no 
	nothing. She listens. Shit. She takes off running.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Matt! Frank! 

	Tracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Matt! Matt! Frank!

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	Linda breaks in the room to see Frank slicked in blood, 
	his throat cut, and Matt bleeding from multiple stab 
	wounds with an extension cord around his neck being 
	pulled tight.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Jesus!

	Linda rushes over and slams into Matt. They fall to the 
	ground. Linda crawls over to Matt, but her head snaps 
	back and her lips erupt with blood.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			Figured it out? You were always so 
			clever.

	Matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his 
	neck. He grabs at the cord trying to breathe. Linda 
	watches him being pulled away.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			No!

	She clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is 
	tossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart 
	pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing 
	but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads 
	for cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to 
	her.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Hang on!

<b>				MATT
</b>			Get out of here!

	Linda pulls Matt toward the door.

<b>				LINDA
</b>				 (yelling)
			You won't get away with this. They'll 
			find out about you. They'll hunt you 
			down.

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			The villagers with their torches? Lock 
			up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's 
			not gonna happen that way.

	Linda hits the lights. The lab is now very, very dark.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			See, I've spent all my time down here 
			thinking up this plan. When they find 
			you, they'll find a pile of charred 
			corpses. The result of a terrible 
			accident, I'm afraid.

	Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She 
	navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack 
	of light at the front door.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			How can you be so brutal?

<b>				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>			I guess because I don't have to look 
			at myself in the mirror anymore
				 (beat)
			Remember that first night I was out? I 
			did something bad, just to see if I 
			could get away with it. And when I 
			did, I realized I could have it all. I 
			can kill in broad daylight. And 
			nobody's gonna tell the police they 
			were fucked by a ghost. Anything I 
			desire I can make happen, but not if 
			people know.

	Linda and Matt have reached the door of the lab. She 
	pushes through it and slams it behind her.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	Linda pulls Matt along.

<b>				MATT
</b>			I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Just keep going. I'll fix you later.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR, LAB DOORS - DAY
</b>
	The doors explode open.

<b>	INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Linda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside 
	the supply room. It's still blood soaked from earlier.

	Linda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place.

	Linda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls 
	to her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now. 

	Linda pulls his scrubs open. The wounds are many and 
	deep.

<b>				MATT
</b>			He surprised us. We weren't 
			expecting...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Shhh. Don't talk.

	BAM! Something slams against the door. Bam! Slams against 
	it again. The old deadbolt is buckling. Linda looks 
	around the room and sees the storage freezer.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We gotta move. Hang on.

	Linda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer.

<b>	INT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
	Linda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks 
	on the door and the jam.

	BAM! The storage room door blows open. Linda leans down 
	next to Matt.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Lin...

	He entire shirt is stained with blood. He's having 
	trouble breathing.

				MATT (cont'd)
			I can't feel anything.

	Linda picks up his hand. Grips it tight.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			You feel that?

	Matt smiles.

<b>				MATT
</b>			A little...

	She rips his shirt open... and sees his wounds. She grabs 
	a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then 
	probes the wound.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Your losing blood, but he didn't hit 
			the vitals.

	She looks around.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sutures and thread.

	She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room. 
	Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She 
	stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda 
	scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. 
	Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no 
	avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The 
	door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still. 
	Then she hears the click of the door locking.

<b>	OUTSIDE THE FREEZER
</b>
	CLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five 
	degrees, down to negative twenty.

<b>	INSIDE THE FREEZER
</b>
	Through the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints 
	heading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and 
	pushes on the door. It won't move.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Goddamnit.

	Linda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of 
	duct tape and pulls off a length.

<b>				MATT
</b>			What're you doing?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			This is temporary.

	She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She 
	tapes it, using duct tape.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You still with me?

<b>				MATT
</b>			Barely.

	A beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air 
	into the freezer.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Just keeps getting worse.

	Linda returns to the door. Shakes it.

<b>	INT. CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
	We hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out 
	into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece.

<b>	INT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
	Linda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear 
	rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens. 
	The tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy 
	tears from her face.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Oh shit.

	The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees.

	Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against 
	the porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass.

<b>	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE
</b>
	A drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly 
	folded. Shirt, pants, shoes. They begin to move.

	Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall, 
	defeated.

<b>				MATT
</b>			There's no way out.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			There's got to be.

<b>				MATT
</b>			They say freezing to death isn't so 
			bad. You just kinda pass out.

	Matt's head rolls back.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Matt! MATT!

	She checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but 
	he's not gonna last long. They're both already starting 
	to turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the 
	shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she 
	sees something. She looks back at the door lock and then 
	she rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the 
	shelf.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We're not dying in here.


<b>	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the 
	mirror applying make-up to his latex mask.

<b>	INT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
	Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric 
	cord. 

	She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold 
	fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out 
	the plastic tube.

	She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the 
	stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.

<b>	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in 
	the mirror. Pretty smooth. Even from relatively close up, 
	he could pass as normal.

<b>	INT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
	Linda furiously winds wire into a coil.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	Sebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists 
	in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian 
	pauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the 
	hallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he 
	pulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping 
	and footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. 
	With machine like precision, he turns and fires. The 
	tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing 
	tumbles over.

	Sebastian continues down the hallway.

<b>	INT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
	Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other 
	end is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an 
	outlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead 
	lights.

	A moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap* 
	a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch 
	she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	Sebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be 
	hard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off 
	the shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and 
	begins mixing.

<b>	INT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
	Linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to 
	the lightbulb, socket. 
	Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies 
	against the nearest metal surface. She's made an 
	electromagnet.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	Sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the 
	centrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He 
	takes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment 
	and then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The 
	vial shatters and...

<b>	EXPLODES.
</b>
	A powerful explosion that rocks the room.

<b>	INT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
	Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up 
	against the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda 
	shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.

<b>	OUTSIDE THE DOOR -
</b>
	We see the lock twitching. Shaking...

<b>	INSIDE THE DOOR -
</b>
	Linda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze 
	and she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once 
	soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes 
	herself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath 
	hangs as a low cloud of Mist.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, 
	calculating their combined power in his mind. Then he 
	closes the top of the centrifuge. He taps a few commands 
	into its timer.

<b>	INT. SUPPLY ROOM
</b>
	The door lock twitches again and twists back. The door 
	swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a 
	supply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble 
	every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.

	She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling 
	his cold body out of the storage locker.

	She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a 
	trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the 
	paper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she 
	does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
	Sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. He 
	heads down the darkened tunnel. Something scampers in 
	front of him. Small, not visible. Sebastian sends it 
	reeling with a swift violent kick.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR, BY THE ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
	Sebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up 
	the tunnel. He taps a code into the elevator vault doors. 
	The vault doors open revealing the elevator.

	The doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside.

<b>				ELEVATOR
</b>			Authorization please?

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Caine. One One One One One.

<b>				ELEVATOR
</b>			Authorization valid. Thank you.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Sebastian!

	And there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds 
	a oxygen container with a cut line.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			I can't let you leave. Come on out and 
			I'll give you one last chance.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't 
			hold on to the past.

	The door starts to shut.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Aaaaaaahhhh!

	She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A 
	line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator. 
	WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs 
	toward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close, 
	she slides. Her foot jamming into it. 
	She lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed 
	into the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in 
	pain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical 
	scrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives 
	toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body 
	fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the 
	tank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights 
	flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of 
	sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her 
	feet and turns to see...

	Half of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a 
	gruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned 
	revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like 
	deformed blackened bubble wrap.

	Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with 
	another shot of flame.

	Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the 
	corner.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Oh God!

	Linda stalks toward him.

<b>				LINDA 
</b>			You wanna see God? I'll show you God. 

	Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex 
	and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, 
	looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the 
	corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering 
	and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose 
	another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and 
	doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks 
	pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the 
	blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he 
	pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb 
	themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet 
	moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable 
	she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. 
	But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She 
	blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE 
	SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water 
	sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the 
	downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes 
	toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs 
	Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand 
	smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, 
	she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She 
	crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to 
	her feet and slams her against the wall.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			I'm gonna find everyone in your family 
			and kill them-. Your sister... she 
			never liked me. I think I'll go after 
			her and her little boy first. 

	Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head 
	cuts open, blood dripping down.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			I just wanted you to know that before 
			you die.

	Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses 
	against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. 
	But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see 
	something also... a watery smudge.

<b>	BAM!
</b>
	MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian 
	slams against the corridor wall and sinks down.

	Matt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. 
	He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he 
	sinks to his knees by Linda.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Thought I'd... thought I'd save you 
			for a change.

	He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Let's got out of here.

	Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. 
	He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the 
	way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The 
	conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The 
	VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the 
	current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His 
	blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his 
	skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly 
	electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and 
	more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in 
	and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
	Just outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the 
	sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.

	Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of 
	chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Nitro...

	Matt peaks inside.

<b>				MATT
</b>			He said it himself... All they'll find 
			is a pile of charred corpses.

	She sees the centrifuge... The timed counter on its face 
	counts down from a minute. Fifty nine. Fifty eight. Fifty 
	seven...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			He's rigged the centrifuge.

<b>				MATT
</b>			In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out 
			the whole lab.

<b>	INT. TUNNEL
</b>
	Linda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the 
	burned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We 
	know the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar 
	at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Grab on.

	Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls 
	herself up. She reaches back down for Matt.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Forget about me. You go.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Fuck you. Give me your hands.

	Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. 
	She struggles, but they both manage to got him through 
	the hatch.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
	Three... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life.

	The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.

<b>	INT. VENT
</b>
	Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator.

	Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the 
	smooth metal surface.

	From the little light below she can see a maintenance 
	ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. 
	They look up and see it disappear into the darkness.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Climb!

<b>				MATT
</b>			But...

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Climb!

	Matt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right 
	behind him.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	The centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are 
	starting to rattle.

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
</b>
	Linda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as 
	they can.

<b>				MATT
</b>			I can't. I'm going to pass out.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Keep moving.

	He does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his 
	wound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much 
	further they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in 
	from the maintenance hatch below.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY
</b>
	The centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The 
	vials shake violently.

	Then... one of the vials shatters.

	A FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the 
	laboratory.

<b>	INT. TUNNEL
</b>
	The EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE 
	FIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in 
	its path.

	One of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the 
	flames. We see its shape briefly before it disappears In 
	a wall of fire.

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
</b>
	The ladder begins to shake. The entire shaft begins to 
	rumble. Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward 
	safety.

<b>	INT. EXHAUST VENT
</b>
	The FIREBALL blows into the vent. Starts rolling down it 
	also.

<b>	INT. TUNNELS
</b>
	More explosions.

<b>	CHAIN REACTIONS. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</b>
	THE EXPLOSIONS rolls toward the OPEN ELEVATOR. Slamming 
	into it... The elevator flies upward.

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
</b>
	The rumbling worsens. The two desperately cling to the 
	ladder. They looks down to see...

	The elevator...

	SURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the 
	explosion's SHOCK WAVES.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Oh God!

<b>				MATT
</b>			Don't look.

	The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. 
	Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the 
	walls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls 
	herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's 
	pressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ... 
	30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM. 
	When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF 
	FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing 
	in.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Move!

	Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares 
	down at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates 
	before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames 
	reaches up to lick the soles of her feet.

	They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the 
	elevator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop and 
<b>	BEGINS TO FALL.
</b>
<b>				MATT
</b>			It's coming down!

	FASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete 
	free- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. 
	Metal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes 
	shears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's 
	tracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda 
	sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as 
	it ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access 
	ladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but 
	continues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the 
	elevator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams 
	there, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and 
	look up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended. 
	There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the 
	ladder.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			C'mon. Before it slips.

	They begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the 
	tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed 
	by Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs 
	there a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed 
	throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her 
	leg.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			It's him.

	She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of 
	dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the 
	ladder.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Sebastian, you fuck.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Get off me.

	Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent 
	dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda 
	tries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian 
	grabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. 
	Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks 
	down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She 
	lets go!

<b>				MATT
</b>			No!

	She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam 
	against the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a 
	few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below 
	her. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But 
	metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. 
	Linda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing 
	dark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from 
	him. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over 
	to the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Let go of me.

	Sebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into 
	her from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand 
	reaches out and strokes her hair.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			Remember the day we met? You were 
			wearing a red dress and you were so 
			pretty. Now... Now look at you.

<b>				MATT
</b>			Get off of her!

	Sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with 
	his filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Sebastian, stop it.

	Linda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try 
	and grab her, help her.

<b>				SEBASTIAN
</b>			You fucked it all up.

	Linda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency 
	brake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold 
	of the ladder.

<b>				LINDA
</b>			Go to hell. 

	Linda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES 
	... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a 
	hundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto 
	the ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her 
	back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.

<b>	EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
	Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine. 
	Emergency crews close from all directions, sirens 
	roaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into 
	the sky.

	An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop 
	out, immediately putting a blanket around her and 
	treating Matt's wounds.

<b>				MARINE GUARD
</b>			What happened?

<b>				LINDA
</b>			We lived.

	Linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin 
	and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground... 
	almost as if something was there.

<b>									 FADE 
</b><b>OUT:
</b>
