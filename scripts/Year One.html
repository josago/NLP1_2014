<b>          IN THE BEGINNING...       1
</b>
<b>          
</b>          BLACK an infinite void but at the center a SINGULARITY, a
          particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains
          all the potential matter and energy in the universe.

<b>          THE BIG BANG
</b>          A blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes,
          particles expanding in all directions until they fill the
          screen, a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust.
          Then the particles start to attract one another to form
          atoms, the atoms elements, the elements form molecules, the
          molecules compounds, the compounds cells, then a cell
          twitches and a PRIMITIVE DRUM starts booming out a Dolby
          heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms.
          Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a
          much bigger fish, and we rapidly rise from the depths and
          pull back to reveal--

<b>          THE SEA                   2
</b>          Vast, blue, rolling toward the shore, brilliant sun rising in
          a cloudless azure sky.
          A WOMAN emerges from the sea like Aphrodite, strongly backlit
          to obscure her nudity, but we can see she is full-breasted,
          long-limbed, toned and tanned-- perfection. Then a MAN rises
          up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily in the
          surf. Even in silhouette we can see he's far from perfect--
          short, overweight. They turn to each other and embrace.
          It's paradise-- for him.

<b>          THE WOMAN
</b>          (looking deep in his eyes)
          I'm so hungry.

<b>          THE MAN
</b>          (wanting her)
          Yeah. Me, too.
          The DRUMS get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to
          kiss her, but she turns and walks away.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          What should we eat?

<b>          THE MAN
</b>          Oh, you actually meant you were
          hungry. I thought-- forget it.

          He follows her.
          They walk toward the trees that fringe the beach. When they
          reach the line of vegetation, the woman, MAYA, kneels, pulls
          berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth.
          The man, ZED, grabs a handful of berries and they squat there
          noshing like Adam and Eve.

<b>          THE WOMAN
</b>          Mmmm, these are so good.

<b>          THE MAN
</b>          Mmrrunm, they really are .
          When she turns away he spits them out in disgust.
          Maya smiles and puts her face very close to his, their lips
          almost touching.

<b>          MAYA
</b>          (very sexy)
          You know what I'd really like?

<b>          ZED
</b>
<b>          (HOPEFULLY)
</b>          What?

<b>          MAYA
</b>          Some fruit.

<b>          ZED
</b>          (frustrated, but hanging

</b>          Yeah, fruit's good.
          (he stands up)
          You want an apple or a pear?

<b>          MAYA
</b>
<b>          (THINKS)
</b>          No.
          He scans the nearby trees.

<b>          ZED
</b>          Orange? Tangerine?
          (she shakes her head)
          Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach?
          She shakes her head coyly.
          He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully pointing out
          various options. She follows him.

          Okay, don't tell me-- papaya?

<b>          NOOO--

<b>          ZED

          Starfruit, casaba-- tangelo?

<b>          MAYA
</b>          Nope.

<b>          ZED
</b>          (he doesn't even like her

<b>          ANYMORE)
</b>          Okay, I give up. Which fruit do
          you want?

<b>          MAYA
</b>
<b>          (POINTS)
</b>          That one.
          Zed looks. It's a beautiful tree with lush, apple-like   red
          fruit hanging from it.

<b>          ZED
</b>
<b>          (SCOFFS)
</b>          Yeah, right. Okay.

<b>          MAYA

<b>          ZED
</b>          Because that's the fruit we don't
          eat! It's forbidden.

<b>          MAYA
</b>          Why not?

<b>          ZED
</b>          Because we don't! It's a rule!
          That's the Tree of the Knowledge of
          Good and Evil. You don't eat from
          that one. Nobody ever has.

<b>          MAYA
</b>          Why not?

<b>          ZED
</b>          Stop saying why not! I told you--
          it's a rule.

<b>          MAYA
</b>          So do you always follow the rules?

<b>          ZED
</b>          No-- yeah-- I don't know. We don't
          have that many rules. In fact, we
          only have one rule-- DON'T EAT THAT

<b>          FRUIT.
</b>
<b>          MAYA
</b>          Okay, fine. We won't. Forget I
          mentioned it. I understand if
          you're afraid--

<b>          ZED
</b>          I'm not "afraid"--

<b>          MAYA
</b>          No, really, it's all right. I just
          thought you might be curious why we
          can eat everything else that walks,
          crawls, swims, flies, or grows in
          the ground, but not that particular
          fruit. And I thought you might be
          the kind of man who's willing to
          take a chance and start thinking
          for himself, but I guess I was
          wrong.
          She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It's
          not Paradise anymore. Then like every man that ever lived
          and will ever live, he caves.

<b>          ZED
</b>          Okay! Fine! You want to try the
          Good and Evil fruit, you got it.
          He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands
          her one. They both stare at the fruit.

<b>          MAYA
</b>          You first.

<b>          ZED
</b>          No way! It was your idea. You go
          first.

<b>          MAYA
</b>          We both bite at the same time.
          Zed considers for a long moment then decides.

<b>          ZED
</b>          Okay. Ready? One-- two-- three!
          Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him
          out and stops before her teeth break the skin.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (with his mouth full)
          Got me. That's a good move. I'm
          going to steal it.
          He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste
          of Good and Evil. Then his face contorts in disgust and he
          spits it out.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (gagging and spitting)
          Yuchh! That's horrible. Yecch,
          ptui! Ughh.
          He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his
          fingers, trying to get the terrible taste out.

<b>          MAYA
</b>          So you're saying it's not good?

<b>          ZED
</b>          Yes! I'm saying it's not good!
          He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a
          loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)

</b>
          A TRIBE OF PRIMITIVE CAUCASIANS. Dozens of huts surround a
          mmunal fire pit where WOMEN in loincloths roll flatbread        CO
          and cook it on heated rocks. The drums start pounding out a
          celebratory rhythm as the HUNTERS enter carrying a DEAD BOAR
          on a pole, their faces marked with boar's blood, ritual signs
          in honor of the kill.
          The lead hunter MARLAK, is a hulking thug with a bony,
          Neanderthal forehead. He cuts off the boar's head and drops
          it at Maya's feet.

<b>          MARLAK
</b>          (blunt grunt)
          For you.

</b>          Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut,
          his guts still aching. His best friend OH sits next to him
          sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy,
          jealous of the attention they're getting from the women.
          If Zed is over-confident and reckless, Oh is his polar
          opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the kind of guy who would
          apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear. He
          may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been
          invented he'd be wearing them.

<b>          OH
</b>
<b>          (GRUMBLING)
</b>          Look at them. Hunters think
          they're so cool. They don't think
          gathering is dangerous? There are
          thorns-- bees-- those big stingy
          ants. I could hunt-- I just don't
          want to. And what's with the blood
          on their faces? They think that's
          sanitary?

<b>          ZED
</b>          (miserable with pain)
          Do me a favor. Just kill me.

<b>          OH
</b>          Why did you eat that fruit? It's
          forbidden. Everybody knows that.

<b>          ZED
</b>          I couldn't help myself! Maya was
          just staring at me with those pouty
          eyes-- and those perky breasts--
          opposable thumbs. And how about
          the name? "The Tree of the
          Knowledge of Good and Evil"? You
          don't think that sounds tempting?
          They should've just called it "The
          Tree with the Fruit that Tastes
          Like Shit." Then for sure nobody
          would eat it.
          Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind
          his dwelling.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (shouts testily)
          Hey! Squanto! Give me a break,
          would ya'! You got the whole
          forest!
          (to Oh)
          Why does everyone have to crap
          right behind my hut?

<b>          OH
</b>          I think, and I could be wrong, that
          all the poop makes the ground more
          fertile, which in turn, gives the
          leaves in the area a softer feel.
          It's a vicious circle.
          Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the
          communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          (calls out eagerly)
          Hi, Eema!
          Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave,
          then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh
          that makes them laugh.

          She doesn't even know I exist.

<b>          (LOVE-STRUCK)
</b>          I want to lay with her so badly.

<b>          ZED
</b>          I don't see it. I mean she's cute,
          but I don't think I'd lay with her.

<b>          OH
</b>          Of course not! She's your sister!
          It'd be like sleeping with your
          mother.

<b>          ZED
</b>          which was a big mistake. I see
          that now. You think it won't be
          awkward the next morning but--
          trust me, you just want to rip your
          eyeballs out.
          (shakes off the memory)
          Listen, if you want to impress
          Eema, tonight at the feast, do the
          fertility dance with her, then drag
          her back to your hut.

<b>          OH
</b>          My hut's a mess. And what if she
          struggles?

<b>          ZED
</b>          So you give her a little tap on the
          head. Women respond to that--

<b>          OH
</b>
<b>          (SIGHS)
</b>          No. She only likes hunters-- not
          gatherers.
          They look over at Eema, who is now slowly stroking the shaft
          of a hunter's spear.

<b>          ZED
</b>          I wouldn't read too much into that.
          She kisses, then tongues the spear tip.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          Okay, that might mean something.
          The hunter Marlak walks by and stops. He's clearly half a
          rung lower on the human evolutionary scale.

</b>          Yes, Marlak. Very observant. I
          was indisposed. Got that
          intestinal thing that's been going
          around.
          Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the

          He picks up a skin with another of Zed's drawings on it, this
          one of a big-breasted naked girl. Zed quickly grabs it and
          holds it upside down.

</b>          That-- would be an antelope-- or a

          the fire in a boar's head mask, accessorized with way too
          many bones, beads and feathers.

          jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool.

          talking to her friends. Oh looks over at Zed for help.
          Zed mimes clonking her on the head.

          Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face, stopping
          him. It's Marlak, who towers over Zed. His cohort,
          ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him.

</b>          Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the

          howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed.

          to be more to life than this--
          (to Hunters)
          Kinda hard to concentrate with that
          rhythmic drumming, fellas.
          The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed.

          Anyways, I'm going away, not
          because you're forcing me to--
          which you are-- but because I
          choose to. Yes, I ate from the
          Tree of the Knowledge of Good and
          Evil-- major misunderstanding on my
          part-- and believe me I'm not
          recommending it unless you're
          interested in a very powerful
          laxative-- but it got me thinking
          about some pretty heavy stuff --
          life questions, you know. So I'm
          out of here, and anyone who wants
          to join me is welcome.
          He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak
          staring at her and averts her eyes.

          Zed shakes his head, failing to notice that the torch he's
          holding has ignited the roof of the hut next to him.
          The Shaman shouts and points at the now blazing roof.

          into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the

          Zed runs for his life through the dense forest.
          The hunters chase him, shooting arrows at him on a dead run.
          Zed dodges as the arrows zip around him. He veers left, then
          right, then trips and tumbles down a muddy embankment.
          The hunters stop at the top of the embankment. Marlak
          listens for sounds of movement in the forest below, then
          silently signals for the hunters to fan out.

          Marlak nimbly makes his way down the embankment, reaches the
          bottom and sees something in the moonlight.
          It's Zed lying on the ground, badly camouflaged with sticks
          and leaves, thinking he can't be seen, but the shape of his
          body is clearly discernible. Marlak raises his spear.

<b>          MARLAK

          (pulls his knife)
          I'm going to gut you like a pig.
          He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is
          struck from behind by a heavy tree branch. He falls heavily,
          knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the
          makeshift club.
          Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh.

          There's no going back! There's,

          Zed is holding a stick over the fire, cooking what looks like
          a squirrel or a muskrat.
          Oh comes out of the forest carrying a huge armload of sticks
          and branches. One of Oh's sticks falls, and as he carefully
          reaches down to grab it, the rest spill out on the ground.
          Oh sighs. His body is covered with long claw marks.

<b>          ZED
</b>          Four men, maybe five. And a child--
          or a small women maybe.

<b>          OH

          Okay.

<b>          ZED
</b>          (poking at the evidence)
          Looks like they had some nuts--
          dried fruit-- some kind of green
          leafy vegetable--

<b>          OH

          Maybe we can find where they peed.
          14                                                              Then Zed sees light through the trees and creeps   14
          stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and
          they peer through the bushes.
          THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond it, well-
          tended fields of growing grain.
          Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals
          Oh to be quiet and stay put.

<b>          ZED
</b>

          He takes his bow, pulls an arrow from his quiver, and slowly
          draws the bow, taking deadly aim at one of the cows. He
          shoots.
          The blunt, pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and
          bounces off. The cow looks up.

          (to Oh)
          We're gonna need some arrowheads.
          Zed draws his flint knife, then suddenly bursts out of the
          forest, dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back.
          Oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends Zed flying.
          Lying on the ground, Zed looks up and sees TWO SURPRISED
          YOUNG FARMERS dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring
          at him.

<b>          FIRST YOUNG FARMER

          He's a hunter. I'm more of a
          "maker." I made this loincloth, I
          do arrows-- I made a shelf unit for

          Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight
          is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and
          wrestle each other to the ground.

<b>          OH
</b>          Shouldn't we do something?

<b>          ZED
</b>          Just let them settle it.
          Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head
          with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and
          lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing
          hard.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)

          Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground.

          ADAM, dour, hard-working and long-suffering, but still strong
          and upright, trudges home with a metal scythe over his

          The rude dwelling has a stark, somber, almost Amish feeling
          to it. Zed and Oh sit at the table sharing a simple meal       youngest
          with Adam, Cain and his
          Adam's wife EVE and h
          them, Lilith's tunic gaping open to reveal her breasts every

          awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks.

          A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly
          on his sorry circumstances.

<b>          ADAM
</b>          For my sin the ground is cursed.
          Thorns and thistles does it sprout

          all the days of our lives. For as

          Okay, that might have been what I
          was thinking at the time, but what
          if some omnipotent force put the
          fruit there because I was supposed

          A small CARAVAN OF CAMELS AND DONKEYS loaded with trade goods
          moves across the arid wasteland. The effete SHEIKH rides the
          lead camel, protected from the blistering sun by a colorful
          canopy. A FEW ARMED BEDOUIN GUARDS ride alongside.
          Bringing up the rear is A LARGE FOUR-WHEELED CART DRAWN BY
          HORSES, basically a cage on wheels into which TWENTY NEWLY
          PURCHASED SLAVES have been crammed, jammed together like
          sardines.
          Zed and Oh are in the middle of the body pile, literally
          cheek by jowl with the other slaves, barely able to move.       I
          Eema is right next to Oh, her body pressed tight against his.
          Oh shifts around, repositioning his arms and body trying to
          get more comfortable and give Eema a little space, but he
          just ends up touching her even more.

          Marlak growls and grabs Oh by the throat, but the struggle
          forces everyone else to shift which causes even more
          discomfort.

          face to face and crotch to crotch with Maya.

          It's too cramped to even throw a punch, so Marlak uses a
          RANDOM SLAVE'S HEAD as a weapon to bang against zed's head
          repeatedly.

          Bedouin guards.
          Their commander, SARGON, his helmet topped with a magnificent
          plume, rides up in the chariot and with one mighty stroke of
          his sword cuts the head off ANOTHER BEDOUIN GUARD.
          Marlak reaches through the bars, grabs the fallen Bedouin's
          sword and hacks off the lock on the door of the slave wagon.
          The door flies open and the slaves tumble, jump and stumble
          out onto the ground.
          Zed and Oh look around, gawking at the massacre taking place.

          Zed and oh stumble over the rocky hills. They hear a PAINED
          SCREAM from someone being circumcised back at Abraham's camp.

<b>          OH
</b>          You have any idea where we're
          going?

<b>          ZED
</b>          To the city. I have to find Maya.

          smite them with holy fire!

          Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom.
          Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points
          off in the distance.

<b>          THEIR POV

          atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls.

<b>          ISAAC
</b>          Me and my friends sneak in on the

          on the babes, drink some wine, get
          wasted on killer hash--

          Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and
          slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries. Isaac quickly
          runs away.

          The sentries shove them into a small guard post and throw

          The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly.
          The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look
          nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.

          fills the door frame.

          You don't look like a woman, but

          me?
          Oh turns away from his foul breath.
          The sergeant grabs Oh by the throat and practically lifts him
          off the ground.

          your own size?

          Right. Enough said.
          The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then
          steps up behind Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a
          lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes.

          A military drum roll and the blare of trumpets rouse the
          garrison. GUARDSMEN come double-timing out of the barracks
          and hurry to line up in formation.
          Last to emerge are Zed and Oh who step leisurely out the door
          now dressed as Royal Guards. Zed actually looks dashing, but
          Oh's breastplate is too big and his helmet keeps slipping
          down over his eyes.

<b>          ZED
</b>          This is great! How do I look?

<b>          OH

<b>          CAIN
</b>          If we see a thief or a pickpocket,
          we just slap him around-- maybe cut
          off a finger or an ear, or the tip
          of his nose, lower lip-- anything
          you can just grab and slice in one
          fluid motion-- then we take our
          share of the loot and let him go.
          Mostly what we worry about are
          activist types, rabble rousers,
          getting people all riled up against
          the King or the Temple Priests.

<b>          CAIN
</b>          Harsh times, brother. We're in the
          middle of a famine. People are
          starving. If we don't get some
          rain soon, it could get ugly.

          Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets
          and turn to look.
          At the sound of the trumpets EVERYONE IN THE CROWDED SQUARE
          falls to the ground and prostrates himself. Cain pulls Oh to
          the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the
          ROYAL ENTOURAGE approaches.
          Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed
          just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only
          one standing.
          EIGHT STRONG MALE SLAVES enter the square carrying an
          ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy. On it
          is the PRINCESS INANNA, a stunning young woman, richly
          dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red
          lips. A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big
          ostrich plume fan.
          Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty.
          Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice
          he's the only person in the square still standing. She gives
          him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously.
          As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at
          Zed. He doesn't recognize her, but we do. It's Maya, now
          elaborately costumed and made-up.
          Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a ROYAL GUARD knocks
          him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the
          entourage passes.

<b>          ZED

          to Oh)

          liked me! She looked right at me.

<b>          OH
</b>          Gee, I wonder why?
          The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all
          get back to their feet.

          At the center of the square is a magnificent temple adorned
          with elaborate carvings and monumental statues of pagan gods.
          Before it is a great altar in front of a HUGE STONE IDOL.
          The idol's mouth is a gaping fiery furnace. Behind the
          temple, is a towering ZIGGURAT still under construction.
          A HUNDRED TRUMPETERS AND DRUMMERS blast a solemn fanfare as
          ORNATELY GARBED PRIESTS ceremoniously climb the stairs to the
          altar.

          The King, an imposing man with Shakespearean gravity, wipes
          his mouth and glances at the Princess Inanna.

<b>          KING
</b>          The Princess isn't eating?

          PRIESTESSES and a dozen VESTAL VIRGINS. They walk in solemn
          silence to ritual positions around the altar.
          The High Priest is even more elaborately costumed than the
          nobles, ridiculously so, standing very tall on high platform
          shoes, with heavy eye makeup, his hair and beard even oilier
          than the others. He turns to the altar, raises his hands to
          the heavens and begins his invocation.

<b>          HIGH PRIEST

          crosses her lips.
          Zed grins back at her.
          The Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and
          subtly points Zed out to her. Maya nods obediently, glaring
          at Zed, and starts fanning the princess a little too
          vigorously.

          maidens. He comes to one SLUTTY GIRL who seems so obviously
          not a virgin, he does a double take and kicks her out of the
          line.

          She walks off before he can answer.
          Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS
          walking past a row of "LIVING STATUES," semi-nude men and
          women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint,
          frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful
          bodies.
          Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude "GODDESS", then
          furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess
          slaps his hand, then resumes her pose.

          is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like
          someone waiting for a bus. He is also painted gold, but
          unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round
          shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long,

          Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a
          household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who
          take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to
          pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm.

          but I'm just checking it out. We
          kept hearing that this place was so
          evil, but now that I look around
          I'm thinking maybe it's not all
          bad. There's a lot to learn here.

<b>          OH
</b>          What? Like human sacrifice?

<b>          ZED
</b>          No! Like the wheel, for instance!
          That's pretty awesome-- the way it
          just goes around in a circle. And
          farming! And metal-- writing,
          money, pottery-- hot baths. Come
          on! Back in the village we thought
          sharpening a stick was a big
          breakthrough.

          He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the

          reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.

          Zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates
          himself, face down on the floor, arms outstretched in
          supplication. He lies there with his eyes tightly shut,
          expecting to be vaporized any second. A long moment passes
          in total silence. Then he opens his eyes and looks around
          tentatively.
          The inner chamber of the Holy of Holies is a bare room with
          marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights
          above.

          The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd. Cain

          The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull
          canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to
          grab stones to throw.
          Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other.

          The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on
          the opposite sides, several bystanders taking painful hits in
          the head, some falling down unconscious.
          Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks
          from all directions.

</b>          Oh fights his way to the temple stairs, runs up and confronts
          a PRIEST who is trying to drag Eema away. He fights with
          very little skill but tremendous energy, finally overwhelming
          the guard and grabbing Eema.

<b>          OH
</b>          (suddenly shy again)
          Hello, Eema.

<b>          EEMA
</b>          (still a little dazed)
          Oh?
          He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes.

<b>          OH
</b>          (suddenly forceful)
          Eema, you're my woman! You hear
          me?

</b>          Okay.

<b>          OH
</b>          Really? It's okay?
          He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the
          mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard
          rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform,
          accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him.

</b>          While Zed is busy with the guards, the High Priest pulls Maya
          toward the fire.
          Zed sees him, finishes the last of the guards, and starts
          slowly moving toward the High Priest who starts backing away
          until he sees Oh moving toward him from the other side. He
          holds the helpless Maya close to the flames.

<b>          HIGH PRIEST
</b>          (screaming and crying)

</b>          (his mascara running)
          No! The Gods demand a sacrifice!
          And you ruined it!
          He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire.

<b>          ZED
</b>          (trying to keep him calm)
          Why don't we just sacrifice
          something small-- a rabbit maybe.
          Or a duck. That'd be good, don't
          you think?

<b>          HIGH PRIEST

<b>          (SCREAMS)

</b>          Then how about this?
          The High Priest turns to Oh.
          Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)

          He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him
          from head to toe. As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed
          dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp.
          The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap
          around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform
          shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's
          fiery mouth. Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame
          like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the
          mouth of the furnace.

<b>          TEMPLE SQUARE
</b>          Everyone goes silent, stunned by the incredible turn of
          events. All eyes turn to Zed and Oh, now standing before
          them on the center stage of the temple.

<b>          ZED AND OH
</b>          They look at each other. Someone has to say something.
          Finally, Zed clears his throat.

<b>          ZED
</b>          I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess,
          and on behalf of, well, the whole
          city, I want to thank the High
          Priest for his incredible
          sacrifice. That was really
          something, wasn't it?
          He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the
          people in the square are applauding.
          At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in
          the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady
          rain starts to fall.
          The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they
          all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as
          it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied
          muttering begins.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)

          Was that a sign from God? Wasn't
          it a sign? What's the deal? We
          all want to know. But I'm not sure
          anybody really knows-- and I'd be
          real suspicious of people who say
          they do. If I've learned one
          thing, it's this: the world and
          everything in it is a miracle. And
          what that miracle means is for each
          and every one of us to figure out
          for himself. Are the Gods going to
          destroy us? Maybe-- I don't know--
          I guess it's possible. But if we
          keep going the way we are, they
          won't have to. We're doing a
          pretty good job of destroying
          ourselves. So maybe we should all
          just go home now, and think about
          what happened-- and be very, very
          good to each other. I know I'm
          going to try.
          (raises his hand in salute
          to the people)
          Peace.
          The crowd stares at him blankly. Nobody knows what to make
          of it all. Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear.

<b>          MARLAK
</b>          All hail the Chosen One!
          With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers.
          In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks around and scowls.

<b>          ABRAHAM
</b>          What am I? Chopped liver?
          At the altar, Maya, revived now, embraces Zed.

<b>          MAYA
</b>          You're incredible, you know that?

<b>          ZED
</b>          That's what I've been trying to
          tell you.
          Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the
          gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on.

</b>
          A caravan is assembling, making ready to leave the city.
          Marlak, Enmebaragesi, Maya, Eema and the other villagers are
          there, as well as a great number of freed slaves and Hebrews.
          Isaac is checking out Maya's breasts.

<b>          ISAAC
</b>          Hey, babe. Ever made it with a
          circumcised guy?
          Marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)

<b>          (BACKPEDALING)
</b>          Is she with you? I did not realize
          that. Sorry.
          Marlak and Maya cross to Zed who is loading a packhorse.
          Marlak looks at him for a long moment then punches him hard
          on the shoulder.

<b>          MARLAK
</b>
<b>          (GRUDGING)
</b>          You did good.
          Zed waits for more, but nothing comes.

<b>          ZED
</b>          (rubbing his shoulder)
          Well said, Marlak. You really have
          a way with words.
          They clasp hands.

<b>          MARLAK
</b>          We'll tell stories about you around
          the fire.

<b>          ZED
</b>          Not much to tell, is there? Just
          an average guy who saw his destiny
          and had the courage to defy a
          powerful empire. No big deal.
          Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one
          is listening to him. Zed joins him.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)

<b>          OH
</b>
<b>          (WORRIED)
</b>          Yeah, just about-- I guess so. The
          Hebrews are going to lead us to the
          sea and we can get boats from
          there. We can trade all this stuff
          everybody gave us for the trip
          home.

<b>          (NERVOUS)
</b>          I don't think I should be the
          leader. Nobody's listening to me.

<b>          EEMA
</b>          (by his side)
          I'll listen to you.
          Oh swells up with pride.

<b>          OH
</b>          (turns to Zed)
          Come back to the village sometime.
          Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a
          tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel.
          OH                                                           (cont'd)

          Hee-ya!
          (beat, quietly to camel)
          Come on. People are watching.
          The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off.
          Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow.
          As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there
          with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground
          beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet.
          Maya joins him.

          horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions.
          MAYA (cont'd)
          The Princess gave me a few gifts
          when she freed us.

          you did.
          Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of
          sheep and goats, tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the
          opposite direction.
          As THE LAST OF THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something
          masculine about her build and posture. Zed nods politely to
          her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him.
