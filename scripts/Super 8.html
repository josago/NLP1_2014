          A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim-
          covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era,
          hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then:
          "DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted
          on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here,
          but there are currently three: "784."
                         
          SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a
          forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes
          the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7."
                         
          Finally, he hangs up a number. "1."
                         
          The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the
          hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how
          bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT

          Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We
          BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black
          suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a
          LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb.

<b>          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>                         
          A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in
          LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,
          notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
          Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,
          now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
                         
          He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt
          trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around
          his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has
          arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR
          with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as
          the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone
          Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in
          his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly
          sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been
          drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.
                         
          Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the
          porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for
          a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and
          stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he
          stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
                         
          A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns
          toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something
          BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts
          open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never
          forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED
          Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad
          car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of
          freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable
<b>                         THAN COMFORTING:
</b>

</b>           I'll be home soon.
                         
          And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them
          drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket
          again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear
          an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.
                         
          Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: "I want you...
          to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:

          DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played
          by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE,
          dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,
          CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his
          FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the
          light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.
                         
          The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low,
          growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.
          Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the
          Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We
          see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK
          DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.
                         
          Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for
          it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a
          terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the
          Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --
          and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie
          DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize
          that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The
          Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist
          -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip
          into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED
          NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and
          after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK
          so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS
          SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails)
          SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE
          IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED.

          He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks
          over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB.
                         
          TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an
          assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma
          wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is
          preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him,
          watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge.
          He looks to her. A beat.

          Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up
          onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a
          girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:

</b>           My dad works at the mill.
                         
          And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for
          something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too
          much for him to bear.

          starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something
          provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes

          SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of
          STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.
                         
          In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly
          shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD
          METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted
          STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around

          off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many
          shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES
          which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:

           billion of them.
                         
          It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind
          them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train

          They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE
          WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.

          BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids
          approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at

          A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it
          up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper.
          They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward.
          We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to

          Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.

          RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their
          adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA,
          eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL
          NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him.
                         
          CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps

          High overhead, a yellow KELVIN sign TURNS atop a tall pole

          In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls. He
          begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare
          utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets
          to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.
          After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past
          the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE
          YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here,
          Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small
          METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.
<b>           58.

          Rooney cranes his neck to get a view. Another METALLIC CRASH,
          this time GLASS BREAKING, too. Then, in the distance, at the
          middle of the salvage yard, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE AIR,
<b>          FALLING AND LANDING WITH A CLANG-THUNK.
</b>                         
          Rooney strains his eyes to see -- what the hell was that? A
          tin can? A piece of a fender? Hard to tell from here.
                         
          Then, thrown into the air: A CAR TIRE. It lands with a THUD.
          Rooney then uses the bucket controls -- MOVES BACKWARD AND UP
          -- a touch higher toward the transformer -- not exactly
          watching how close he is getting. He stops. Watches.
                         
          An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded,
          twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.
                         
          Rooney is stunned. As the METALLIC RUMMAGING SOUNDS CONTINUE,
          Rooney moves the bucket EVEN HIGHER -- when suddenly his
          bucket BEEP-BEEPS LOUDLY -- a warning he's too high -- and he
          suddenly stops it and the BEEPING STOPS --
                         
          But so do the rummaging sounds. SILENCE, save for the eerie
          HUM OF POWER. He waits. Nothing. Wants a better view, so he
          begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.
                         
          We're in a WIDE SHOT, seeing his DESCEND, PAINFULLY SLOWLY.
                         
          Then we're in a LONG LENS CLOSE UP of Rooney as he SLOWLY
          DROPS -- TIGHT ON HIM as he's looking over toward the salvage
          yard -- and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking
<b>          SOMETHING BEHIND HIM -- SO BIG WE DIDN'T SEE IT -- COMING OUT

</b>           There are so many different grays,
           it's crazy. And you pour a little
           onto like a paper plate. Then you
           take a dry brush and you just dip
           it in, then you brush on the paper,
           so the paint's barely on the brush.
           Then you make small brush strokes
           on the model. Little ones, like
           where the wear and tear would be.
           Around the wheels. Or where the
           doors would slide. Then you do it
           again, like with Camouflage Gray--
           or here, I used Insignia Red to
           make it look like there was another
           coat of paint on there before. Like
           they painted over it, but you could
           see it scratched off.

          And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him
          -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT
          HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector
          to stop it -- but:

          Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She
          watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.
                         
<b>                          ALICE (CONT'D)

</b>           ... yeah...
                         
          And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to
          fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:
                         
<b>                          JOE (CONT'D)
</b>           ... it's so weird watching her like

           existed.
                         
          A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.
          Finally, quietly:

          Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes
          wet, Alice turns to Joe.
                         
<b>                          ALICE (CONT'D)

          Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally:

</b>           He's your dad.
                         
          Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
          Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of
          SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound
          remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE
          CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.
                         
          Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube
          VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.
                         
<b>                          ALICE JOE

</b>                         
                         
          Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube
          -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.
                         
          They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the
          SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to
          touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -
<b>          - ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A
</b>          FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to
          the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He
          moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance,
          trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.

          A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe.

          On the OTHER side of the glass, Nelec rights himself,

          from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the
          kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either.

          fear in Nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his
          fate. Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face
          -- to silently -- in a look -- repent. Instantly, Joe knows

          all their eyes on Nelec -- except Joe, who only wants to get

          Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE

          descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge --
          Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:

          Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it
          would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON

          In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER
          and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out
          of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from
          them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of
          course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned.

          RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly
          move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and
          amazes them all at once.

          SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand
          on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.

          Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt.
          Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND

          out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the
          LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.
                         
          Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who
          also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --
          FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE
          NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS
          in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,
          but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the
          verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears
          -- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not
          ever. But then something happens.
                         
          Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we
          see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young
          woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his
          mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes
          suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down
          her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on
          his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
                         
          And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS,

          And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
                         
          As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally...
                         
<b>           FADE TO BLACK.
</b>                         
                         
<b>                          THE END
</b>
