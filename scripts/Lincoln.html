<b>          EXT. BATTLEFIELD, JENKINS' FERRY, ARKANSAS - DAY
</b>                         
          Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two
          feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted,
          their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still
          yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.
                         
          A terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies,
          Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee-
          deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath,
          fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets,
          pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy,
          nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely
          hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners.
                         
<b>           HAROLD GREEN (V.O.)
</b>           Some of us was in the Second Kansas
           Colored. We fought the rebs at
           Jenkins' Ferry last April, just
           after they'd killed every Negro
           soldier they captured at Poison
           Springs.

          Rain and fog. Union Army companies are camped out across the
          grounds. Preparations are being made for the impending
          assault on the Confederate port of Wilmington, North
          Carolina.
                         
          Two black soldiers stand before a bivouacked Negro unit:
          HAROLD GREEN, an infantryman in his late thirties, and IRA
          CLARK, a cavalryman in his early twenties. ABRAHAM LINCOLN
          sits on a bench facing Harold and Ira; his stovepipe hat is
          at his side.
                         
<b>                          HAROLD GREEN
</b>           So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided
           warn't taking no reb prisoners.
           And we didn't leave a one of `em
           alive. The ones of us that didn't
           die that day, we joined up with the
           116th U.S. Colored, sir. From Camp

          Harold Green is a little startled at Clark's bluntness.

</b>           Now that white people have
           accustomed themselves to seeing
           Negro men with guns, fighting on
           their behalf, and now that they can
           tolerate Negro soldiers getting the
           same pay - in a few years perhaps
           they can abide the idea of Negro
           lieutenants and captains. In fifty
           years, maybe a Negro colonel. In a
           hundred years - the vote.
                         
          Green's offended at the way Clark is talking to Lincoln.

           and I can't cut hair.
                         
          Lincoln smiles.

          remains, looking down. Green leaves. Clark looks up, salutes
          Lincoln and, turning smartly, walks toward his unit.
                         
          Then he stops, turns back, faces Lincoln, who watches him. A
          beat, and then, in a tone of admiration and cautious
          admonishment, reminding Lincoln of his promise:

          continues reciting in a powerful voice:

          A huge, dark, strange-looking steamship, part wood and part
          iron, turreted like a giant ironclad monitor, is plowing
          through the choppy black waters of an open sea.
                         
          Lincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no
          railing, open to the sea. The ship's tearing through rough
          water, but there's little pitching, wind or spray. The deck
          is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret.

          Lincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon,
          indicated by a weird, flickering, leaden glow, which appears

          The room's cozy, attractive, cluttered, part dressmaker's
          workshop, part repository of Mary's endless purchases:
          clothing, fabrics, knicknacks, carpets. Books everywhere.
                         
          Lincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy
          frame. He's in shirtsleeves, vest unbuttoned and tie
          unknotted, shoeless. He has an open folio filled with
          documents on his lap.
                         
          MARY LINCOLN sits opposite, in a nightgown, housecoat and

          A working room, sparsely furnished. Lincoln's desk is heaped
          with files, books, newspapers. The desk's near a window, now
          open. Comfortable chairs and a rocker are in a corner. Near
          the fireplace, in which embers are dying, there's a long
          table, eight chairs around it, settings by each chair of
          inkwells and pens.
                         
          Dozens of maps cover the walls and the crowded bookcases.
                         
          Lincoln opens the door and enters to find his 10 year-old son
          TAD LINCOLN near the hearth, sleeping, sprawled on a very
          large military map. Lead toy soldiers are scattered across
          it.
                         
          A large mahogany box, imprinted ALEXANDER GARDNER STUDIOS,
          is open near Tad's head. The box contains large glass plates,
          each framed in wood; these are photographic negatives. Tad's
          been looking at several, which lie near him on the map.

          Lincoln kneels by Tad and looks down at the map, a
          topographical and strategic survey of the no-man's land
          between Union and Confederate forces at Petersburg. He
          scrutinizes the precisely drawn blue and grey lines.
                         
          He lifts one of the glass plates and holds it to the
          firelight: it's a large photographic negative of a young
          black boy. There's a caption, in elegant cursive script:
          "Abner, age 12 - $500"
                         
          And another: "Two young boys, 10 & 14 - $700"
                         
          Lincoln puts the plates back in the box and closes the lid.
          Carefully brushing the toy soldiers aside, he lies down
          beside Tad. He touches Tad's hair and kisses his forehead.
          Tad stirs as Lincoln gets on all fours; without really waking
          up, knowing the routine, Tad climbs onto his father's back.
          Tad holds on as his father stands, weary, and maybe a little
          surprised to find his growing son slightly heavier than he
          was the night before.

          into place; as the crowd applauds, he takes a sheet of paper
          from inside his hat and glances at it. Then he looks up.

          turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays "We

          them, Secretary of State WILLIAM SEWARD, 64, in a thick,

           certain about the legality of my
           Proclamation, just it wasn't
           downright criminal. Somewhere's in
           between. Back when I rode the legal
           circuit in Illinois I defended a
           woman from Metamora named Melissa
           Goings, 77 years old, they said she
           murdered her husband; he was 83. He
           was choking her; and, uh, she
           grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-

           wood and fractured his skull, `n he
           died. In his will he wrote "I
           expect she has killed me. If I get
           over it, I will have revenge."
                         
          This gets a laugh.

</b>           No one was keen to see her
           convicted, he was that kind of
           husband. I asked the prosecuting
           attorney if I might have a short
           conference with my client. And she
           and I went into a room in the
           courthouse, but I alone emerged.
           The window in the room was found to
           be wide open. It was believed the
           old lady may have climbed out of
           it. I told the bailiff right before
           I left her in the room she asked me
           where she could get a good drink of
           water, and I told her Tennessee.
           Mrs. Goings was seen no more in
           Metamora. Enough justice had been
           done; they even forgave the
           bondsman her bail.

</b>           I'm afraid I don't -
                         
<b>                          LINCOLN
</b>           I decided that the Constitution
           gives me war powers, but no one
           knows just exactly what those
           powers are. Some say they don't
           exist. I don't know. I decided I
           needed them to exist to uphold my
           oath to protect the Constitution,
           which I decided meant that I could
           take the rebels' slaves from `em as
           property confiscated in war. That
           might recommend to suspicion that I
           agree with the rebs that their
           slaves are property in the first
           place. Of course I don't, never
           have, I'm glad to see any man free,
           and if calling a man property, or
           war contraband, does the trick...
           Why I caught at the opportunity.
           Now here's where it gets truly
           slippery. I use the law allowing
           for the seizure of property in a
           war knowing it applies only to the
           property of governments and
<b>           27.
</b>                         
                         
           citizens of belligerent nations.
           But the South ain't a nation,
           that's why I can't negotiate with
           'em. So if in fact the Negroes are
           property according to law, have I
           the right to take the rebels'
           property from `em, if I insist
           they're rebels only, and not
           citizens of a belligerent country?
           And slipperier still: I maintain it
           ain't our actual Southern states in
           rebellion, but only the rebels
           living in those states, the laws of
           which states remain in force. The
           laws of which states remain in
           force. That means, that since it's
           states' laws that determine whether
           Negroes can be sold as slaves, as
           property - the Federal government
           doesn't have a say in that, least
           not yet -
           (a glance at Seward,
<b>                          THEN:)
</b>           - then Negroes in those states are
           slaves, hence property, hence my
           war powers allow me to confiscate
           `em as such. So I confiscated `em.
           But if I'm a respecter of states'
           laws, how then can I legally free
           `em with my Proclamation, as I
           done, unless I'm cancelling states'
           laws? I felt the war demanded it;
           my oath demanded it; I felt right
           with myself; and I hoped it was
           legal to do it, I'm hoping still.
                         
          He looks around the table. Everyone's listening.
                         
<b>                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
</b>           Two years ago I proclaimed these
           people emancipated - "then,
           thenceforward and forever free."
           But let's say the courts decide I
           had no authority to do it. They
           might well decide that. Say there's
           no amendment abolishing slavery.
           Say it's after the war, and I can
           no longer use my war powers to just
           ignore the courts' decisions, like
           I sometimes felt I had to do. Might
           those people I freed be ordered
           back into slavery? That's why I'd
           like to get the Thirteenth
           Amendment through the House, and on

          in line at one of these behind Giles Stuart, who completes a
          transaction and leaves, counting money. Bilbo, barrelling the

          drop his money. Bilbo and Schell both kneel to help.

<b>          INT. THE PRINCE OF WALES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>                         
          Lincoln enters a dark room, its heavy drapes closed against
          the dim afternoon light. There are two beds. One is stripped
          bare. The other is canopied with a thick black veil.
                         
          Mary, dressed in a deep purple gown with black flowers and
          beading, perfectly pitched between mourning and emergence, is
          seated at the head of the canopied bed. On a nightstand next
          to the bed there's a toy locomotive engine, a tattered book
          of B&O railroad schedules.
                         
          Mary holds a framed photograph: an image of WILLIE, 12,
          handsome, bright-eyed, confident.
                         
          Lincoln crosses to the window.

          Mary, radiant, her charm turned to its brightest candlepower,
          is greeting the Blairs, who are part of a long receiving

          The enormous room is splendid, decked with garlands of
          flowers, tall candelabra burning, flags from Army divisions.
          An orchestra plays.
                         
          Lincoln and Tad stand together. Slade is near Lincoln. Mary's
          a distance away from Lincoln, to his right.
                         
          Robert takes his place next to his mother, as conspicuous as
          he'd feared he'd be in his civilian clothes.

          A sea of people surround the President and his family.
          Nicolay, Hay and several clerks channel the crowd waiting to
          greet the Lincolns into the line: wealthy people, many more
          middle-class people, some working people and farmers, and
          many officers and soldiers.
                         
          Tad watches his father shake hands. Lincoln is in his
          element. He stands close to each person, touches each one
          gently, stoops to be nearer them; he puts everyone at ease.
                         
          He's bothered only by the white kid gloves he's wearing. He
          tugs at the right-hand glove.

          Lincoln takes off the right-hand glove - his hand-shaking
          hand - but keeps the other glove on.
                         
          Approaching Mary on the line, Stevens, Ashley, Senators Bluff
          Wade and CHARLES SUMNER, all in formal wear except Stevens.

           thousands on public days! They will
           never love you the way they love

           important to remember it.
                         
          She gives him a slight, lethal smile. He holds the look; his
          poker-face yields to a barely perceptible smile, amused and
          perhaps a little admiring.

          bins, muffin and pastry molds, spoons and knives, the
          detritus of the preparations for the finger food served at
          the reception, which has now transitioned into a dance and is

          The telegraph office looks improvised, even after four years.
          Formerly the War Department library, it's lined with
          bookcases stuffed with bundled dispatches. Telegraph cables
          stretch across the ceiling to the cipher-operators' desks.
                         
          Stanton, perpetually exhausted and impatient, storms down the
          stairs with Welles and the chief telegraph operator, MAJOR

           the same thing are equal to each
           other."

</b>           That's a rule of mathematical
           reasoning. It's true because it
           works; has done and always will do.
           In his book, Euclid says this is
           "self-evident."

</b>           D'you see? There it is, even in
           that two-thousand year old book of
           mechanical law: it is a self-
           evident truth that things which are
           equal to the same thing are equal
           to each other. We begin with
           equality. That's the origin, isn't
           it? That balance, that's fairness,

          Hearing a creaking, rumbling sound, Robert turns to see TWO
          BLACK ORDERLIES in grey uniforms wrangling a large top-heavy
          wheelbarrow, covered with filthy canvas. One orderly pushes
          while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over.
                         
          Robert notices, in the barrow's wake, a trail of blood. He
          gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a
          corner of the building.
                         
          Behind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with
          puddles of water, Robert watches as the orderlies reach the
          edge of a shallow pit. One orderly pulls the canvas back,
          revealing severed legs, arms, hands, rotten, burnt, shattered
          by bullet or bomb.
                         
          Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit.
          Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs.
                         
          Robert walks away, unsteady.
                         
          Around the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling
          paper and tobacco. He locates these and tries to focus on
          rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking. He tries harder to
          control his hands, his feelings, but he can't. He has a panic
          attack, crying, hiccupy shallow breathing, face flushed.
          Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold
          back tears.

          Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past
          him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns.

</b>           What my people are to be, I can't
           say. Negroes have been fighting and
           dying for freedom since the first

           any ask what freedom will bring.
           Freedom's first. As for me: My son
           died, fighting for the Union,
           wearing the Union blue. For freedom
           he died. I'm his mother. That's
           what I am to the nation, Mr.

          Seward sits at his grand desk, looking on with an anxious
          scowl. Lincoln sits on the edge of Seward's desk. Yeaman sits
          in a chair facing him.

           filled with colored men in chains,
           heading down the Mississippi to the
           New Orleans slave markets. It
           sickened me, `n more than that, it
           brought a shadow down, a pall
           around my eyes.

           can remember, in a way it never
           troubled my father, though he hated
           it. In his own fashion. He knew no
           smallholding dirt farmer could
           compete with slave plantations. He
           took us out from Kentucky to get
           away from `em. He wanted Indiana
           kept free. He wasn't a kind man,
           but there was a rough moral urge
           for fairness, for freedom in him. I
           learnt that from him, I suppose, if
           little else from him. We didn't
           care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

          representatives caucusing, or staring up at the visitors.
          Something powerful strikes him. In a voice coarse with

          with fear, he looks up at the sound of his name. He can't
          speak. Wood and Pendleton watch this, deeply alarmed. Hawkins
          snaps out of it.

          Disgust briefly flashing across his face, McPherson crosses
          out and changes LeClerk's vote to an abstention. The cheering
          and booing degenerates to intense argument about what this
          means for the vote count.

          Lincoln stands, waiting. The only sound is the ticking of
          the clock. And then the ticking is slowly drowned out as
          bells begin to peal throughout the city. Lincoln raises the
          window as Tad rushes to him. The bells are joined by a
          cannonade. The sound of jubilation fills his office.
                         
          Lincoln turns from the window to Tad, who stares out eagerly,
          seeking out the source of the noise. Lincoln puts his hand on
          Tad's head. He looks down at his son, silent.

          Representatives throw papers in the air, embrace, weep,
          shout, dance, climb on desks. In the balcony, Mary stands
          slowly, beyond tears or joy; Mrs. Keckley stands with her,
          smiling, crying. Preston Blair applauds vigorously. The black
          visitors join the general exultation, overwhelmed, some
          praying, others embracing and weeping.
                         
          Latham's, Schell's and Bilbo's seats are empty; they've gone.
                         
          Ashley, grinning from ear to ear, tears streaming down his
          face, is hoisted up on shoulders and marched around the room,
          as on the floor and in the balcony, people start singing "The
          Battle Cry of Freedom."
                         
          Pendleton, with the face of someone who's seen his world
          collapse into ruin, walks straight at Yeaman, who's listening
          to the singing, deeply moved, his face full of wonder.
          Pendleton turns, without a word, and leaves the House.

          Stevens clumps over to the Clerk of the House, who is placing
          his tallies and the official copy of the amendment bill in a
          folio. He looks up.

          Thaddeus Stevens is hobbling in the opposite direction,
          making difficult headway against the crowd, pushed and
          shoved, unrecognized; he shoves back, his ferocious scowl

          Lincoln, his stovepipe hat atop his head, is mounted on a
          horse on a rise at one end of the field. Behind him, several

          Debris is scattered all around him, along with the bodies of
          fallen soldiers.
                         
          He looks up and across the battlefield; a terrible battle has
          concluded a couple of hours ago.
                         
          Looking down, as he rides, he sees soldiers killed by
          artillery fire, whose bodies lie twisted, burned, headless,
          limbless, torn in two, blown out of their clothing or charred
          too badly to tell. He sees soldiers killed by rifle and
          bayonet, whose corpses are intact.
                         
          At the beginning of his ride, all the dead and wounded are in
          Union blue, the casualties of Confederate cannon fire, felled
          as the Union army, about six hours earlier, began its final,
          successful drive to break through Confederate lines.
                         
          As Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey
          and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle.
                         
          He reaches the other side of the field, passing a Confederate
          flag to enter the now-ruined town of Petersburg.

          He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed
          with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused
          with grey. His brow has grown smoother.

          OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in
          the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's

          ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a
          CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is
          blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse.
                         
          Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside;
          but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at
          Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions:
          pride, defiance, blankness.
                         
          Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his
          staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln.

          Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that
          Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the
          two men who look awkwardly at one another.
                         
          Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes
          for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union
          Army remove their hats.
                         
          Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises
          his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling
          slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away.

          Lincoln's in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening
          wear, his hair brushed down and plastered in place. William
          Slade is working the tie and gloves. James Ashley and

          John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily
          marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked. He drops

          Slade grabs them, considers chasing after Lincoln, then
          thinks better of it. He walks back towards the office. Then
          some strange feeling stops him, and he turns around again.
          Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down

          the theater, LEONARD GROVER, steps out before the curtain and

          to him. Tad pulls away and begins shrieking, clinging to the

</b>           Yet, if God wills that it continue
           until all the wealth piled by the
           bondman's two hundred and fifty
           years of unrequited toil shall be
           sunk, and until every drop of blood
           drawn with the lash shall be paid
           by another drawn with the sword, as
           was said three thousand years ago,
           so still it must be said "the
           judgments of the Lord are true and
           righteous altogether."

          country, wounded soldiers, civilians in black. And for the

          African Americans, civilians and soldiers.

           charity for all, with firmness in
           the right as God gives us to see
           the right, let us strive on to

           him who shall have borne the
