          The world turns below us, vast and slow.
                         
          A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the
          shadow. We cast the shadow.
                         
          Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions:
          river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world.
          No trace of civilization.
                         
          The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an
          ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a
          VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY

          THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow.
                         
          They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white.
          Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker
          had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and
          hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
                         
          Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.
                         
          They are ENGINEERS.
                         
          Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
                         
          The third is naked.
                         
          One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box:
          inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.
                         
          The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness.
          It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises
          the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.
                         
          BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his
          lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.
                         
          Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of
          teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him.

          ...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
                         
          The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach
          his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a
          felled tree. Engulfed.
                         
          The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
                         
          Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky.
                         
          As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in
          their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing.
          Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.

          A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement:
          far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain.
                         
          A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep.
          Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood.

          She slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab
          lies in her palm.
                         
          As she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.

          An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with
          robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside
          the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
                         
          This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many
          disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.
                         
          The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt
          - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.
                         
          Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a
          rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches:
          we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.
                         
          The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The "stars"
          are plankton shining in the floodlights.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>                         
          Watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. A
          sea-trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness.

          She watches the screen of a ground-penetrating radar system.
          A bright signal return: something hidden in the cliff in
          front of her. Something big.

<b>          EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
</b>                         
          Watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm.
          Silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. She
          brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away
          loose silt and stones.
                         
          The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps.
                         
          Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to
          keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears.
                         
          In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its
          outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
                         
          Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:

          A second excavator glides out of the dark.
                         
          At the controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary
          genius and archaeologist. Dark-haired and lean, with the
          rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers
          and a T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
                         
          He plays his floodlights over the obelisk.

          Watts floats her excavator down the front of the obelisk.
          Scanning the alien text. Suddenly she stops. Grips the
          obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.

          the two vehicles at their aft hatchways.

          Behind Watts, a hatch opens with a splatter of water.
                         
          Holloway climbs in. Squeezes into her cockpit. A tight fit.
          He's distracted by her body, pressed so close - but she has
          eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.

          In the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. The horizon
          is dominated by the VOLCANIC PEAK - the same peak we saw in
          the distance in the prologue.
                         
          Aboard the research vessel, cranes lift Watts and Holloway's
          excavators out of the sea and onto the deck.

          on the deck - fifteen feet long.
                         
          Watts and Holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in

          crouch beside Watts's freezer, staring inside.
                         
          They are DOWNS, 30, a lean fidgety crewman. STILLWELL, 40, a
          sturdy fellow with the geniality of a labrador. And KAMAROV,

          Holloway sits up in the next freezer over. He yanks the IV
          lines out of his arms and legs. Climbs out of the freezer.

           undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was
           engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic
           studies are equally conclusive. Pulses
           of cultural change are harder to
           prove, but even there your case is

          A utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches and table bolted to

          ANDREW CHANCE, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial
          bearing and a bristling salt-and-pepper mustache.
                         
          MONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her

          On the south face of the pyramid, an IRIS DOOR of many blades

          DAVID stands beside Vickers at her holography terminal. He
          lays his hand on over a signal plate - and the terminal
          lights up with a three-dimensional image.
                         
          The core chamber of the pyramid, from DAVID's point of view.
                         
          It's apparent that DAVID's eyes see more than human eyes do.
          He seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as
          visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene.
                         
          The structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated
          patterns of energy. This is incomprehensible technology.

          An ENGINEER'S HEAD rises into view, ghoulish and elephantine.
          Vapor rises from it. A readout blinks: STERILIZED.
                         
          They lift it onto the steel table. It takes both of them.

          rotate on the laboratory displays. X-ray and ultrasound.
                         
          Holloway leans close to study an X-ray image. He almost seems
          to see a ghostly second face...

          She gets a fingertip into the seam. Works with a probe. Pries
          away the long-dead Engineer's mask. It comes free.
                         
          The visage revealed is human, except for its giant scale.
                         
          White-skinned. Earless. Hairless. Withered but beautiful as a
          Greek statue. Eyes closed. An expression of suffering on its

          Watts covers her nose in revulsion. A horrible stench: The

          They lift the rotting head into the drum, retching. Fingers
          skidding in putrefaction.
                         
          They pour formaldehyde over it. As soon as the head is
          immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and
          smocks, scrubbing their hands.
                         
          The god's head sits in its murky vat, shedding skin and tofu-

          Milburn laughs at him. Lets the eyeless centipede wind its
          segmented body around his space-suited arm.
                         
          In the flat face, a white vertical slit appears. Changes
          quickly to a horizontal position; opens enough to suggest a
          mouth. Milburn doesn't notice this development.

          The centipede spirals around his arm, glittering, its body
          moving in fluid waves. The blind head quests between his

          suit. A trickle of scarlet from the hole.
                         
          Fifield is delirious with horror. He clutches at the

          She runs forward - finds Holloway staggering blearily toward
          her, leaning on the wall. His helmet and most of his gear are
          missing; only his chest lamp shines.

          Suddenly Holloway tenses, muscles rigid. Shuddering. Watts

          Holloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead:
          the beam awakens the organism. Its sphincter mouth dilates.
                         
          A soft white octopoid FACEHUGGER descends on a quivering rope
          of mucus. Sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor.
                         
          Acid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass.
                         
          The vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. Watts huddles
          against the wall, gasping.
                         
          In the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs
          curled in.
                         
          She looks up. Sees the open molluscoid above where Holloway
          lay. The other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells.
                         
          Terror. She steals out of the chamber.

          Watts emerges into a hallway. Leans against the wall, wide-
          eyed. Panting with the horror of what she's seen.
                         
          She glances left and right. Jumpy now.
                         
          All is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into
          the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear,
          now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk.

          A circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across.
          Its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. Watts
          follows her map into the space in awe.
                         
          Dominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped
          vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know
          it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear.
          Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors.
                         
          Watts glances at her map: Holloway's holographic trace leads
          right up the gangway into the ship. She goes.

          ceiling. A green glow emanates from grooves in the floor.
                         
          In the center of the chamber: a PILOT'S CHAIR.

          A mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented
          like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and
          waiting for some connection. The chair is empty.
                         
          Above the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into
          the air, its function unknowable.

          An extraordinary facility.
                         
          A console, nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor,
          dominates the room.
                         
          Four immense coffin-like cockpits are built into the console.
          In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead.
                         
          But the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY:
                         
          The barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of
          some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses.
                         
          The air above the console is filled with spheres of light.
          They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be
          in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos.
                         
          Watts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among
          those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the
          homeworld of the Engineers themselves.
                         
          A bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels
          itself, becoming an open door. DAVID walks in, his hand
          raised in command. He clearly caused the door to open.

           Engineers were bringing to Earth. This
           was a death ship.
                         
          A facehugger emerges from the egg, its grotesque fingers
          clawing at the air. This is not the boneless squid that
          attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored.
                         
          DAVID strokes it curiously: the thing ignores his touch.
          Climbs Watts's body.

          The facehugger scuttles toward her face. Watts shrieks.
                         
          DAVID grabs it nonchalantly by the tail. Dangles it in front
          of their faces, studying it.

          Watts shudders, staring at the thing. For a moment the
          grander horror eclipses her own peril.

          Watts twists her face away as the long fingers close around
          her head. Clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis
          thrusting at her mouth. Her heels hammer the deck.

          It is a humanoid demon, spindly limbs and bony back. Boneless
          and flexible and monstrously strong. A threshing eel's tail.
          Its blunt head dolphin-like and elongated.

          Suturing ravaged flesh. A nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant.

          Vigoda breaks into the cabin, a gun in his hand.
                         
          He scowls at the bloody track on the bed - and then freezes,
          seeing Watts inside the Med Pod, a vivisected woman. The
          autosurgeon hard at work.
                         
          The parasite crawls into view behind Vigoda. It has already
          trebled in size. He does not see it before it leaps at him.
                         
          He dies in seconds. His throat ripped open. Lies staring at
          nothing. His submachine gun lies beside him.
                         
          Watts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts.
          She stares at the dead man in a fog of horror.
                         
          The parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid.
          Limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. Spines from its
          back. Metamorphosis.
                         
          With a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its
          serpentine position. It becomes a devil with an lethal,
          elongated skull. An Alien.
                         
          The Alien turns its head. Looks at Watts inside the Med Pod.
                         
          Her breath catches. She passes out.

          She looks down, bleary and hurting. Her star-shaped wound is
          stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures.
                         
          The pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs.
                         
          She takes a deep breath. Looks out - and freezes.

          Through the glass canopy - spattered with blood - Watts sees
          a full-grown Alien crouching over Vigoda's body on the floor.

          The pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar. The
          intravenous lines drop out of her arms.
                         
          Watts realizes the pod is about to release her.

          Slowly she reaches out. With trembling fingers she grips the
          canopy to hold it closed.
                         
          The Med Pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine.
          Sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. Watts closes her
          eyes. Grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. Jangling pain.
                         
          She opens her eyes.
                         
          The Alien hunches over Vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh.
                         
          The ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. The canopy
          pulls free of Watts's weakened grip. Swings quietly open.
                         
          Watts huddles in the open pod. Naked but for her bandages.
                         
          The Alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. Its spiny back
          to her. Vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod.

          Watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. Lays
          her hand on the gun. Drags it a few inches closer.
                         
          The Alien turns its pale eyeless head. Watts freezes.
                         
          For a moment time stops.
                         
          The Alien lunges. Watts snatches up the gun and FIRES. Holds
          the trigger down. The Alien jerks and staggers - an eye-
          twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes - and falls.
                         
          Watts empties the clip into the thing. Acid gouts from its
          wounds and eats into the deck - until a section of decking
          gives way and falls to the deck below, leaving a dark hole.

          Watts collapses on the rug, cradling her stomach in pain.
                         
          She crawls to Vigoda's desecrated body. With her eyes half-
          averted from the sight, she searches the body. Finds a spare
          ammo clip and jacks it into the gun.

          Watts walks down the hallway in trousers and jacket. Leaning
          on the wall, her face drawn with pain. One hand laid over the
          fantastic scar on her abdomen. The gun slung on her shoulder.
                         
          Dark events have transformed the Magellan. The metal of the
          walls is torn in some places; in others, blackened by fire.
                         
          Watts rounds a corner. Finds a workstation left in shambles:
          lockers and chairs overturned. A pool of drying blood.
                         
          Wide smears of blood show where something man-sized was
          dragged out of the puddle - across the floor - up the wall.
          Into the darkness of an open vent.

          She rounds the corner toward the Bridge.

          Glasse presents Watts with his handiwork: her old pair of
          magnifying goggles, retrofitted with Engineer lenses.

          The Sleeper tosses the head away. Seizes the body by the legs
          and swings it against the ground like a flail. Again. And
          again. Horrific power and violence. DAVID's arms come off.

          She Sleeper roars - though the wounds are pinpricks to a
          being of his size. With startling speed be moves to a
          sarcophagus against the wall. Steps into it.
                         
          The sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting
          him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen
          bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid.
                         
          But this suit is not withered. Its glossy goggle eyes and
          elephantine breathing tube are functional - bulky apparatuses
          thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms.
                         
          The Sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus - and Ray's next
          burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the Sleeper's
          armored shoulders and head.
                         
          The Sleeper strides out of the chamber.

          In the dark ribbed corridor, a second Alien crouches in the
          dark. It drops into a hunting crouch as footsteps approach.

          But a WHITE-GLOVED HAND seizes the Alien by the neck from
          behind. The Alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks
          under a terrific force.
                         
          Rending sounds as the hard-shelled Alien is torn apart.

          Shepherd escorts Vickers toward the exit of the Juggernaut.
          Turning a corner, they freeze.
                         
          Ahead of them in their headlamps, a space-suited figure
          crouches in the middle of the passageway. Doing something
          with its hands: smoke rises from debris on the floor.

          The figure turns.
                         
          The label stencilled on the space suit reads FIFIELD. But the
          face is of no human shape. A hideous hybrid of the crewman
          and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific.
                         
          Its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate
          skull. Spines have burst through the suit from within, down
          the crewman's spine. Clawed fingers piercing his gloves.
                         
          Shepherd and Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But
          Fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness.
          Shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the darkness behind him. Claws tearing
          deep. Shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded.
                         
          Vickers runs. Pounding through the dark in blind terror.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck.
          She rolls over, gibbering and begging. The Fifield-thing
          leans close to her faceplate. Its voice is a travesty.

          Fifield from forty feet away.
                         
          Acid sluices over Vickers as Fifield collapses on top of her.

          flesh and bone.

          but Janek has taken half the instruments apart.
                         
          Janek scrambles to restore the components he's removed.

          Watts right behind him - DAVID's inert head under her arm.
          Glasse and Stillwell bring up the rear.
                         
          The Orrery is transformed - no longer a neutral star map, but
          a flight plan laid in from LV-426 to Earth.
                         
          The Sleeper stands at the far end of the room, hands
          gesturing. In Watts's enhanced sight, it's a vision of glory:
          waves of energy dancing under the Sleeper's touch. Rivers of
          information flowing. He finishes his work as they enter.
                         
          Ray draws a bead on him just as he strides out of the room.

          The seat vacant. The door standing open.
                         
          As they stare inside, baffled, the wall across the corridor -
          directly behind them - silently unravels. The Sleeper is
          revealed, a towering gargoyle in his flight suit.
                         
          He steps forth. Obscure devices clutched in his fists.
                         
          Too late they perceive him. They spin. Raise their guns.
                         
          Vanity and foolishness. This is the wrath of an angry god.

          impotently. And then the Sleeper strikes.
                         
          The missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. Neither
          solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied
          in the fabric of space itself.
                         
          The first missile crushes Ray like an invisible fist. The
          second splashes Glasse against the wall like an insect.
                         
          Reflexively Stillwell reaches out for Watts. Wraps himself
          around her protectively. The blow lands an instant later.
                         
          Stillwell and Watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a
          staggering impact. Watts is dazed: Stillwell killed.
                         
          Woozy, she sees the Sleeper step into the Pilot Chamber.

          revealing the hangar outside, the stars, the horizon.
                         
          A mystic view that renders solid matter translucent, painting

          the central pyramid.

          A light races toward the Magellan down the canal: a rover.

          Janek watches the rover come - and the Holloway Alien -
          boneless and white - unfolds itself from the instruments over
          his head.
                         
          Its goblin-shark jaw juts out. Sinks its horrific teeth into
          Janek's right shoulder.
                         
          Janek howls in agony. His right arm is paralyzed by the bite.
          He gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand.
                         
          The Alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat.
                         
          Janek gets the pistol. Flips it in his hand. Fires over his
          shoulder. Two, three rounds...
                         
          The bullets punch easily into the Alien - but the soft flesh
          closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. Its
          teeth tighten.
                         
          Watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. Swings a heavy
          rifle like a bat with all her strength. A crushing impact
          wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils.
                         
          Watts reverses the rifle. Pulls the trigger. A fusillade of
          bullets shreds the Alien's head. It collapses, dead.
                         
          Watts wrenches her helmet off. Rips a first-aid kit from the
          bulkhead and helps Janek to stanch the bleeding of his
          horrific wound. She gets the bleeding stopped. Wraps him in
          bandages.
                         
          Janek will live - but his right arm is useless.

          A gout of green acid onto Watts's helmet.
                         
          The Alien falls aside, thrashing its death-throes, the saw
          still growling.
                         
          Watts sees ACID COMING THROUGH HER HELMET - fast.
                         
          With frantic haste she unlatches her helmet. Wrenches it off
          as it crumples and melts.
                         
          She stands bare-headed in the toxic air. Desperate, she looks
          around with tearing eyes.
                         
          In the distance she sees an intact module of the Magellan.
                         
          She runs for it. Slaps the door switch. Incredibly, it opens.

          She finds herself staring at a grand piano. She's in
          Vickers's suite. Its amenities intact, through the floor's a
          few degrees off level. She takes a breath. Good air.
                         
          She walks around. Turning things on. Lights. Music. Surreal
          comforts. She drinks water from the tap.
                         
          She opens the door to Vickers's secret room. Military space

          A crackle from the room's intercom.

          burn. The gray world of LV-426 restored.
