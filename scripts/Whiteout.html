</b>          Antarctica. Six million square miles of ice.    The
          coldest place on earth.
<b>          
</b>          Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain
          outposts. The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in
          check.
<b>          
</b>          There is no regular law enforcement. A single U.S.

</b>          Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white
          wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.
<b>          
</b>          CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged
          peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist'
          of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting
          ice.
<b>          
</b>          STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt
          crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat
          stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage
          beauty, then...

          with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops
          out --
<b>          
</b>          -- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death.
          It's a man.
<b>          
</b>          Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have
          snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted
          -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and
          spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with
          startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.
<b>          
</b>          We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre
          shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE
          PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling
          white.

          she's not at the beach.

          got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels
          above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm

          unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the
          space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical
          beach.
<b>

          next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with

          about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection --
          what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right
          temple.

          bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'.

</b>          She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of
          empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN:
          None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with
          "Theft of botany sample." And "None."
<b>          
</b>          A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces.
          Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up.
          Just stares unhappily at the binder.
<b>          
</b>          Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the
          cardboard tiles.
<b>          
</b>          She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a
          row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform
          graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other
          girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday
          cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere,
          sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm.

</b>          Pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible
          in the dissipating range of light.
<b>          
</b>          Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a

          coat.
<b>          
</b>          Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it,
          but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks.
          Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks.
<b>

</b>          Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch
          area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a

<b>          
</b>          Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire
          onto the battery, and prepares for another.

</b>          Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her
          head.

</b>          Pryce touches the last wire to the battery.   Nothing
          happens. Hope freezes.
<b>          
</b>          Pryce tries again --
<b>          
</b>          -- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting
          around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet
          coming in and out of their light.
<b>          
</b>          SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on,
          halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's
          width.
<b>          
</b>          They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of
          ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a
          THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift
          from God.

          frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT
