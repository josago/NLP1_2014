     After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the
     source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED
     TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches
     in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to:

1A   A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it    1A
     is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the
     truck is SHUT and we cut to:

1B   The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips    1B
     are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a
     wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest
     warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS--
     steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The cart and wagons we
     were following disappear into a maze of synchronized
     activity.

1C   The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is             1C
     constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply
     raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards
     that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The
     striped tulips fetch a very high price.

1D   The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated 1D
     sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end
     up on a truck heading for the airport.

1E   The tulips are loaded onto a plane. During the transatlantic
     flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold.

1F   The tulips are unloaded from the plane, driven across an    1F
     airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane.

1G   The tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a   1G
     truck. The truck drives through a small town and pulls into
     the back of a

     A YOUNG MAN takes delivery of the flowers and carries them
     through the rear of the store to the display area up front.
     We stay on the tulips as we hear the following conversation:

</b>              It's an accident. It means the
              flower developed a virus early
              in the bulb stage. The flaws
              create the unusual coloring.

</b>              Of course. What kind of price range

    Now we SEE the customer: TESS.

</b>              Well, it's for my parent's
              anniversary. They don't know I'm
              coming. I just want it to be
              beautiful. Can you just do whatever
              you think looks best?

<b>                        OWNER
</b>              I'll need a few minutes.

</b>              Take your time, please. And thank
              you.

    The Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the
    flowers are arranged. Tess walks around, looking at the rest
    of the store.

    Tess looks out the window. A black sedan is pulling up at the
    curb.

<b>                        OWNER
</b>              That should be some surprise.

</b>              Which?

<b>                        OWNER
</b>              For your parents.

<b>                        TESS
</b>              Oh. Yes. I hope so.

    One of the POWER TWINS gets out of the driver's side door and
    crosses in front of the car. Tess starts moving away from the
    window.

    Almost immediately, his expression clouds. He looks at his

     Rusty glances in his rearview as he drives through the city
     talking on his cell phone. He's keeping an eye on a white
     Cadillac that seem to be following him.

<b>                         RUSTY
</b>               736.18 degrees Fahrenheit, Felix.
               I watched it.

<b>                         FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.)
</b>               Rusty. What do you want from me?

     Rusty turns a corner, then glances in his rearview again.

<b>                         RUSTY
</b>               I want what I paid for.

<b>                         FELIX
</b>               And that's what I sent.

<b>                         RUSTY
</b>               No, Felix, no. I paid for pure. And
               if my workshop were on top of Mount
               Everest it would be pure. But I'm
               at sea level, Felix, and at sea
               level it should liquefy at 736.95.
               If it's pure, that is. Which this
               isn't.

     Rusty makes another turn. A few seconds later, the Cadillac
     turns behind him.

<b>                         FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.)
</b>               Well, I didn't know you were going
               to liquefy it.

     Rusty pulls to a stop light. The Cadillac pulls up three cars
     behind him.

<b>                         RUSTY

               Christo calls his cotton supplier
               and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do
               you think his supplier sends him
               98% cotton and 2% polyester and
               when that doesn't work, says to
               Christo, "Well, you should have

     Rusty snaps his phone shut.

               My god.

     Rusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car
     to a stop. He gets out of his car and slams the door shut.
     He walks back to the Cadillac and knocks on the window. It
     rolls down electronically to reveal Benedict.

                Wow. No, seriously, that's great. I
                have a child. A daughter. She's
                five. They get to you, right? Am I
                right? Like emotionally. I mean,
                sometimes she'll turn to me with
                her little face and her little
                shiny eyes, and she'll say, "Daddy,
                please stop hitting me," and it
                just breaks my heart.'

      People aren't sure what to make of this.

                I'm Livingston Dell. Thanks for

      Livingston strides off stage as we see that he is at the
      Bellagio, in the lounge. Benedict and the Power Twins are
      waiting for him. Somehow he isn't surprised.

               But there's something else.
               Something in the eyes.

     The person with him nods.

               Yes. When I look into a horse's
               eyes, I can tell: This one's a
               winner.

     A jacketed WAITER appears, holding a tray.

     reaches for his wallet.

</b>               See, you're not hearing me. What
               I'm trying to tell you is the
               reservations agent made a mistake
               when she issued the ticket, because
               on the rare occasions that I fly
               commercially, I always book a first-
               class ticket with no restrictions--

     The desk agent looks back at him skeptically.

</b>               She may have, air, but this is the
               only ticket available to you on
               this flight. I need you to step
               aside so I can take care of the
               next customer.

     Two TSA officers run metal detecting wands over every inch of

     squeeze toothpaste from his Sensodyne tube, sniff his hair
     products, unroll his "tighty-whitey" briefs....

     Turk moves on, taking us past a sleeping Saul and landing on
     Danny and Rusty, who watch a movie with fixed expressions. A
     reverse angle shows us that the video screen is twenty rows
     away--it is impossible to discern any detail at all. Rusty
     takes his headphones off and exhales. Danny notices this and
     does the same. After a beat:

               be in five years, career-wise, and
               I've decided I really want to be

               really see myself as kind of an

     Danny and Rusty lead an obviously eager Linus towards a
     coffee house.

</b>               She'll try and use her looks to
               distract you. Don't let her.

<b>                           LINUS

<b>                         RUSTY
</b>               Don't get soft on us. Don't make
               too many concessions.

<b>                           LINUS
</b>               I won't.

     Danny and Rusty nod. Okay.

</b>               The onset of summer is like a woman
               who owns too many shoes.

     She/He looks to Linus, who looks to Danny and Rusty.

               If animals were capable of
               flattery, the World Bank would be
               open until 8pm.

</b>               When I was four years old, I saw my

     Again, the Evelyn looks to Linus, who has nothing to say.

               fallen asleep in front of the

               in front of the television but not
               remember his dream.

     Evelyn nods and looks to Linus, as do Danny and Rusty. He
     furrows his brow, then speaks:

<b>                         LINUS

               am a traveler of both time and
               space, to be where I have been.

     Danny and Rusty stare at Linus like he's nuts, like he's just
     cracked. Evelyn's entire expression changes.

<b>                         EVELYN
</b>               Your young friend has a great deal
               to learn about respect.

     She/He puts his/her drink down and walks to another part of
     the establishment.

<b>                         DANNY

     The thirty pylons extend from the base of the house into the

     Europol Agent ISABEL LAHIRI gives a presentation to seventy-
     five of her colleagues. With her on stage are a couple of
     seated HIGHER-UP TYPES. She's nervous.

<b>                         ISABEL
</b>               Let's discuss, briefly and to
               begin, with the category of
               "thieves", as distinguished from
               the larger category of what might
               be termed "hardened" criminals.
               The highest level, "master
               thieves," if you will, is a very
               small world. Between six and ten
               high-level crews are operating in
               Europe at any given time.
               Worldwide, no more than twenty. The
               most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is
               either dead or retired, and the
               expectation is that no one will
               replace him. The good news is the
               trend is toward their extinction.

     The secretary enters the auditorium and walks toward the

</b>               For example: Anecdotal evidence

               insufferable.

     The Higher-Ups look at each other; what did she just say?

<b>                         ISABEL
</b>               Their egos demand constant praise,
               and they embellish their exploits
               to anyone who will listen. They
               tell their own stories endlessly,
               provided of course, they are
               talking to a fellow thief or an
               intimate.

     Many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering
     if this is appropriate.

<b>                         ISABEL
</b>               Those who interact with them on a

               positions of total servitude, with
               no chance for growth or freedom.
               Their lives are treated as
               secondary. Many of them suffer from
               depression. It's a crime for which
               there is no law, and yet causes
               untold damage.

     One of the Higher-Ups convinces the other to say something,
     but by now Hess the Male Secretary has reached Isabel and
     interrupts her by whispering into her ear. She balances.

     Isabel looks around Vanderspeigle's home office.   Behind a
     fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe. In
     the other direction is Vanderspeigle's bedroom.

               We can't figure out how they

</b>               No, that would have triggered the

     Isabel goes to the alarm pad. Pulls the face plate off,
     examines the inside.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               And damaged the circuits.

<b>                         PAM

               got in.

<b>                         ISABEL
</b>               They had to have known the code.

     She moves on to look in the mark's BEDROOM.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>                   (calls to her)
               We considered that, but the mark
               swears that nobody in the world
               knew the code except him. He
               programmed the last seven steps of
               the system himself. He set it and
               never left the house again. When he
               dies, we'll probably have to
               physically cut all the power lines
               to the house to get it off line.

     Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which
     was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle's bedroom
     closet. She answers the detective almost as an afterthought.

<b>                         ISABEL
</b>               There are other ways to get the
               code.

               Closed loop. Redundant servers.
               Titanium encasement. Not bad.

     The lead detective enters the bedroom.

<b>                            PAUL
</b>               Like what?

     Again, Isabel is inside her own mind. She's really just
     answering the detective's questions out of courtesy.

               watched him type the code in
               through a pair of binoculars.

     We GO WITH HIM as he walks back into the office. He stands
     at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. He
     twists around and looks out the window behind him.

               Unless he had a habit of typing in
               the code like this--

     He stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type
     in the numbers. It's an obviously unnatural position. Then
     he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one
     normally would.

                         PAUL (cont'd)
               --then his body would block the
               view from across the canal.

<b>                         ISABEL
</b>               That's why they probably set up

     She points out an adjacent window on another wall.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               --And used the mirror.

     She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. The
     detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the
     keypad, then he looks in the mirror. He can see directly
     across the canal into another house.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen
               hundred millimeter lens to get a
               clear shot but--

     But Isabel's already moved on. Something has caught her
     attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that
     is shinier than the paint that surrounds it.

     the shiny area. When she pulls her finger away there is

     Isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from
     Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the
     paint. The plaster there is soft and wet. In fact it isn't
     plaster at all. It's spackle.

     Isabel is at the window. The one that Vanderspeigle leaves
     cracked open every night. Isabel looks across the canal at
     the apartment where Basher and Saul were playing cards.

</b>               They would have fired from that
               roof. Through this open window.

     Isabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure
     she's correct.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               From that roof, through this

<b>                         ISABEL
</b>               Sorry. Your friend downstairs put
               me in a bad mood.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>               He's an idiot. You shouldn't let

<b>                         ISABEL
</b>               Yes. You're right.

     Isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "Eugene
     `Basher' Tarr." There are two names above Basher's in her
     little book: "Robert Ryan" and "Danny Ocean."

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               But these man are exceptionally
               good. Even when they make mistakes.

     A bolt flies through Vanderspeigle's open window and hits the
     wall above the alarm pad. Two thin wires are attached to a
     tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. The
     wires run back to the window of the apartment across the
     canal.

     Inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel
     which is mounted on a large tripod for stability.

     In effect the group now has a mini-clothesline running
     between the alarm pad and the apartment across the canal.

     Livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over
     the number pad of Vanderspeigle's keypad to the "clothesline"
     that runs across the canal.

     Isabel writes: "Livingston Dell?" Underneath Basher's name in
     her notebook.


<b>76   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                        76
</b>
     Livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through
     Vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel.
     Magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place
     over the top of the keypad.   Livingston then types a six-
     digit code into a remote keypad. His keypunches are mimicked
     by the remote device. Vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off.

     Downstairs: From inside we see the front door lock picked.
     The door swings open.

     Isabel nods her head. There's a slight smile on her face.
     The smile of admiration, respect in another's skills.

     Danny and Rusty come through the front door. They are
     followed by Linus. All of them are soaking wet from 24 hours
     in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the
     pouring rain outside the front door. The group silently
     slips up the stairs.

     They enter Vanderspeigle's office. You can hear him snoring
     in the other room. Danny and Rusty quickly, carefully remove
     the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window.
     They drop it (and the attached wires) to the Malloys, who are
     waiting on the street below.

     Meanwhile Linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over
     the spackle.

     Danny and Rusty turn to see that Linus is finished. They
     hand-signal each other like Special Forces guys do, then move
     towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall.

<b>                            ISABEL (V.O.)
</b>                 That must have really been

     Suddenly:

<b>                            DANNY
</b>                 Wait!   Wait! Shhhh!

     Everyone freezes. Danny puts his hand up to his ear to try
     to listen for the sound he thought he heard. We hear the
     faint sound of somebody singing to themselves.

     Danny and Rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the
     bookcase. What the hell?

     They yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome
     Frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of
     Vanderspeigle's safe.

     Danny and Rusty stare at him.   He turns around and sees
     them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't
     showing it. Danny approaches him. This exchange is whispered
     with a great amount of drama at very close range.

     Isabel shakes her head.

     Frustrated and more exhausted than their detainee, the two

     where Isabel is.

     They shrug. Isabel goes into the room with Evelyn. We STAY
     WITH Onderdonk and Davenpeck, who watch her through the two-
     way mirror.

     THROUGH THE MIRROR: Isabel walks right up to Evelyn, smiles,
     and whispers one word to him/her.

     Evelyn's face freezes. He/she looks at Isabel, scared. Then
     he/she starts to weep. Uncontrollably.... Tears stream down
     his/her face.

     Isabel hands Evelyn a sheet of paper and he/she begins to
     write.

     Onderdonk and Davenpeck are dumbfounded.     Isabel turns
     around so she's facing them.

     a dorky look on his face, peering out from behind a mailbox
     he's using as cover while he spies on Isabel.

                object, obviously, but my mentor
                fell silent. Later I asked him
                about it. He said if I really
                wanted to say I was the best
                thief...I'd have to prove I was
                better than the eleven of you.

</b>                Hi, this isn't official business.
                Actually, I'm here on vacation. But
                I was sitting in a cafe this
                afternoon, near the Piazza Navona
                and...the police were chasing
                someone on foot. I was just
                wondering if you caught him or...do
                you know anything about that case?

      Isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the
      newspaper, enjoying her vacation. She looks up and stops
      cold.
      Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored
      suit, sits down three tables away from her.
      She stares at him. Can't believe it. The brazenness. The
      audacity of this guy. Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in
      the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian.
      Finally, Isabel just can't help herself.   She gets up and
      walks over to Rusty's table.

                to the egg, got right up here and

                embarrass myself or this

      Saul, Frank, and Rusty sit on plush couches and watch
      Isabel's conversation with the museum director from six
      different angles. Clearly, Livingston has tapped into the
      museum's closed circuit system.

                half the electronic system, let me
                post eight cops in the room...

      Saul, Frank, and Rusty clench teeth and fists... On pins and
      needles for a moment. If the museum director agrees they're
      in big trouble.

<b>                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.)

      The guys relax back into the couches, their plan narrowly
      having escaped disaster.

      digital quality to it -- because we are watching them now
      through a hi-def TV screen.

      PULL BACK to REVEAL Toulour, sitting in a warehouse of his
      own, watching his own surveillance footage of both our guys'
      warehouse and the museum's closed circuit system.

      front door of his apartment with Isabel. It's a perfect

      nothing else. Nothing on the walls or the shelves.    Isabel
      has clearly moved out.

      Yen ENTERS FRAME -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker.

      He whispers Chinese into a bullhorn.

      Theoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and
      Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up
      the camera, lights, and flags.

      Each "crew member" carries an odd-looking oversized "light
      meter". Upon closer examination we can see that each device
      has a small TV screen on it -- which is tapped into the
      museum's closed circuit system. The guys are carefully
      placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the
      egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the
      gallery.

      "Studio Execs," Reuben and Linus go to "Julia."

      Isabel watches as the "US Government" Gulfstream containing
      all the members of Rusty's crew that she arrested at the
      museum taxis down the runway and becomes airborne. She turns
      to Rusty.

      Rusty points nearby at another private plane.    The pilot has
      just opened the door and put the stairs down.

<b>                          RUSTY
</b>                That one's ours.     We can be there

      Toulour stops. Danny and Tess just look at him. Something
      about their demeanor is troubling. Namely, that they look
      completely untroubled.

      a truck.

      The truck moves out of the garage and on to the street as

      LINUS. Across from him is one of the Normal-Looking Guys. The
      other Normal-Looking Guy is a row away, facing him.

      Linus looks at the door of the car.

      Puts his magazine away.

      Is almost to Linus's row, he stumbles a little, almost falls.

      Then, with a loud WHOOSH the train goes completely dark. It's
      gone into a tunnel. We hear Saul's voice CRY OUT.

      In a few seconds, the train exits the tunnel and the lights
      come back on.

<b>      SAUL
</b>
      Has fallen into the lap of the BackPack kid. Linus and the
      Normal-Looking Guy try to help him up.

      He stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat.

      In the warehouse in NYC, we see Danny and Rusty "arguing",

      he's never lost before.

      He sits down.
