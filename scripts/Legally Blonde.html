    "HEAD OVER HEELS" by the Go-Go's plays as we wind through a
    flock of abstract, silky, golden strands -- PULLING BACK, to          
    discover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRL's head.           
    But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the
    blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC.

    We PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade
    card. She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts              
    and glitter surrounding and "Good Luck Tonight!" and "Elle            
    and Warner forever!."

    She carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across
    the hall, into the room of --

    THREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom
    routine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card
    Girl out and into the room of --

    A BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a
    Stairmaster as "General Hospital" plays on a tiny TV. She
    signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to           
    the room of--

    A BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long
    enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her
    neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of --

    A BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a
    glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE         
    GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being
    signed, as the drinks go the other.

    Once the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we
    follow her out of the room and down the hall until she
    reaches the very last and biggest door --
    She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides
    the card under the door.

    The CARD slides into the pink room, hitting the feet of
    UNDERDOG, a tiny chihuahua ~ who picks it up in his mouth
    and trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in
    strappy sandals.

    An equally perfectly manicured hand with a "Sisters Forever"
    charm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up Underdog.

    As he rises, we RISE WITH HIM, passing toned, waxed, tanned
    legs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs
    encased in a spaghetti-strap top -- until we finally reveal a
    magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful
    face. This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta
    Gamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone.

</b>
                  (into the phone)
              I love you, too!
    Behind her, a "Go USC" banner is pinned to the pink wall. A
    stack of "Cosmopolitan"s and "Glamour"s teeters on the
    dresser. The closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes
    in a predominance of pink.

    She hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing Underdog's
    head and taking the card out of his mouth. She reads it,
    touched.

    A Delta Gamma/Sigma Chi barbecue in full swing. Beautiful
    college students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out
    who they're going to sleep with next.
    The main wall of the living room has been designated as a
    "Model Wall" of Delta Gamma girls -- ELLE smiles at us from a
    Hawaiian Tropic ad and a Miss June USC calendar photo. A
    cover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot MARGOT; a USC
    cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde SERENA
    in a pom-pom pose.
    Serena walks up, fending off an admirer.

toward Serena and Margot, holding the card.

Delta Gamma Pledge sweatshirt, standing alone.

As they go, Elle leads Amy over to a group of jovial Sigma

trying on a Herve Leger white mini-dress. Sexy and ultra-
tight.                                               ;

                I just love him so much! I loved him the
                first moment I saw him. He's beautiful
                and smart and someone I totally respect.
                And I did everything I could to make him
                love me, but it wasn't enough. Now what
                am I supposed to do? I planned my whole
                future around him. My life was going to
                be all about Warner. Now what's it going

              who was also a private sperm donor, was
               allowed visitation rights as long as he
               came to terms with the hours set forth by
               the parents. So, if we're sticking to
              past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn't

               You'd think so, since the stiff was
               sixty, but she was rich on her own. Some
               kind of fitness empire. You can buy her

               years ahead of me. But I used to take her
               class at the LA Sports Club. She's
               amazing!
     The others looks at each other and roll their eyes.

                 You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy
                 Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we

                 That's right. Because isn't the first
                 cardinal rule of perm maintenance that
                 you are forbidden to wet your hair for at
                 least twenty-four hours after getting a
                 perm at the risk of de-activating the

      "Welcome Law Students Class of 2004" banners hang over
      orientation tables. Nervous first year students stand in
      line.
      We PAN ACROSS a row of club tables -- passing "Harvard Law         .
      Journal" and "Environmental Law Association" ·-- until we           
      reach a table that proudly bears the banner of "Blonde Legal
      Defense Club".
      Elle, in a red 2L t-shirt, stands behind the table,

      of the stack. Elle turns to see EMMETT next to her.

                Right?
      Elle smiles and looks down at -- the NEWLY BLONDE SARAH.
      Sarah returns the smile as we PULL BACK to see a CROWD of
      first year girls gathered around Elle's table, rushing to
      sign up. Ready to be as blonde as they can be.
