               Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the 
               oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- 
               a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy 
               clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.

               CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a 
               fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting 
               from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and 
               louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.

               CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a 
               man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is 
               upon us, flashing by with a roar.

               Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the 
               embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the 
               thick underbrush alongside the tracks.

               It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS 
               AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the 
               train fades off until there is silence once more.

               TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash.

<b>               EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY
</b>
               A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side 
               overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- 
               tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.

               One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.

               She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite 
               activity -- eating.

               Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS 
               CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, 
               black and ugly in the sunlight.

               REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.

               The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun 
               shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight 
               into REGGIE's face.

               Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks 
               at him sternly.

               SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early 
               thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join 
               REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS.

                         Va jouer, mon ange.

               JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so 
               lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of 
               cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.

               No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as 
               REGGIE continues eating.

                         just too miserable.

               REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards 
               the devastated table before following.

</b>                         It is infuriating that your

               covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows 
               beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their 
               conversation continuing.

<b>               EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY
</b>
               An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-
               worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, 
               their conversation continuing.

                         I admit I moved to Paris because I

                         French Traditional. I loathe the 
                         idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if 
                         only Charles had been honest with me -- 
                         that's all I ask of anybody -- the 
                         simple truth. But with him, everything 
                         is secrecy and lies. He's hiding 
                         something -- something frightening -- 
                         something terrible -- and evil.

               She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over 
               her. She wheels, terrified.

</b>
               A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the 
               face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this 
               particular mask stare down at REGGIE.

               terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA, 
               takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face.

                         before.

               He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into 
               the drawer, closing it fiercely. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN sticks 
               his head in the door.

               The POLICEMAN leaves and closes the door.

</b>                         On Wednesday last your husband sold 
                         the entire contents of the apartment 
                         at public auction. Furniture, 
                         clothing, kitchenware -- everything. 
                         The gallery, in complying with his 
                         wishes, paid him in cash. One million 
                         two hundred and fifty thousand New 
                         Francs. In dollars, a quarter of a 
                         million. The authorities in Bordeaux 
                         have searched his compartment on the 
                         train. They have searched it 
                         thoroughly. They did not find 
                         $250,000, Madame.

               He opens the desk drawer, puts the cigar back in his mouth 
               and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk-
               top before he remembers REGGIE's request. He puts it back in 
               the drawer again. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters 
               again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits 
               on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into 
               the basket.

                         found in the train compartment. There 
                         was no other baggage. Your husband 
                         must have been in a great hurry.

               He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, 
               identifying each item as he does.

               He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts 
               to put the things back into the basket while he speaks:

               He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport 
               which he hands to her.

<b>               INSERT -- PASSPORT

               The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it 
               to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in GRANDPIERRE's 
               photo. Under it is the name: "CHARLES LAMPERT."

               He hands her another passport.

               One is Italian which, when opened, shows the same photo with

               The house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late

               window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby.

               Suddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING.

               He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and 
               flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more

               row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, 
               dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row,

               The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of

               The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the

               GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at 
               LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid 
               succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle 
               from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.

               He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to

               Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against

               from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.

               He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING

               Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight -- 
               tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight 
               back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which 
               meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the 
               first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his 
               hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle. 
               Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops 
               before the coffin and stares into it.

</b>
               As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to 
               dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard 
               at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand 
               from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel, 
               picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down, 
               into the coffin.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND
</b>
               The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly 
               but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's 
               hands. There is no reaction.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE
</b>
               He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then 
               finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks 
               back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after 
               him.

                         just as hard and as fast as you can. 
                         You may not have a great deal of 
                         time. Those men know you have it 
                         just as surely as we do. You won't 
                         be safe until the money's in our

               REGGIE nods. He writes something on a pad of paper and tears 
               it off, handing it to her.

                         both my office and my apartment. 
                         Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and 
                         please don't tell anyone about coming 
                         to see me. It could prove fatal for

               One of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain 
               days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between 
               the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment, 
               Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of 
               CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard.

<b>               VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN

               Sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their 
               attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended 
               by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the 
               slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils.

<b>               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE
</b>
               Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are 
               laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention 
               caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low 
               for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin.

               After a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over 
               the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice.

               laughing self-consciously and looking around.

                         comme ça -- and passed to the player 
                         behind you -- sans vous servir de 
                         vos mains -- using nothing but the 
                         chin -- no hands -- and keeping the 
                         orange at all costs from touching 
                         the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et 
                         Messieurs -- begin, ladies and 
                         gentlemen -- signore e signori, 
                         comminciate!

               The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons 
               to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. 
               REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.

               Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one 
               under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man 
               at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the 
               game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women 
               behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under 
               their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using 
               their hands.

               (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's 
               partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against 
               the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly 
               enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next 
               in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest 
               miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of 
               human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-
               ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the 
               orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can 
               only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide 
               from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on 
               the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve 
               it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity 
               which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even 
               new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be 
               a torment for total strangers and/or the English).

<b>               VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME

               Some of the couples in various states of confusion, 
               entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, 
               hilarious.

<b>               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL
</b>
               It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but 
               quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an 
               abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the 
               twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber 
               the game but increase his worldly experience.

               The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to 
               move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success 
               difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange 
               starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after 
               it.

               She is enjoying it thoroughly.

<b>               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL
</b>
               Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, 
               PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilà, grips the orange 
               under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations 
               from members of his TEAM.

               Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment.

<b>                                     PETER
</b>                         En garde.

<b>                                     REGGIE
</b>                         Lay on, MacDuff.

               They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all 
               possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers 
               seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they 
               are too good despite themselves and the transfer is 
               accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.

               REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, 
               turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an 
               embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, 
               the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in 
               BARTHOLOMEW's photo.

               REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.

               Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly 
               in REGGIE's ear.

<b>               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON
</b>
               Her eyes show her fright as he whispers:

               As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON
</b>
               He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he 
               merely closes his eyes.

               Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well 
               as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward.

</b>                         Reggie -- what's the trouble?

               REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance.

               She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, 
               under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him 
               for a moment.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON
</b>
               Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling 
               down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange.

<b>                                     GIDEON
</b>                         Forgive me -- it was quite 
                         unintentional, I'm sure.

<b>               WIDER ANGLE
</b>
               GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes.

<b>                                     REGGIE

                         Wait for me -- I won't be long.

               She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a 
               flight of stairs.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER

               Watching her go, a concerned look on his face.

               A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's-
               women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door.

               The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes 
               down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light 
               and closing the door after her.

<b>               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
</b>
               REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops 
               it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one 
               given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on 
               it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.

<b>                                     REGGIE

                         Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me?

               She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her 
               coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice.

<b>                                     REGGIE
</b>                         Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, 
                         Regina Lam...

               Suddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to 
               look, slamming the receiver down as she does.

<b>               REVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               TEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo), 
               the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the 
               doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in 
               his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the 
               door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified.

               TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket.

               He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the 
               burning match in his hand afterward.

               TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the 
               booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically.

               TEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She 
               beats this one out too.

               He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with 
               it. She shrinks back.

</b>                         It could get a whole lot worse.

               Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he 
               punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE 
               is too busy beating them out to do anything else.

               As REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into

               into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her

               As REGGIE leaves the elevator, followed by PETER. They walk 
               to her door. There is a moment of silence as she looks at

               He turns and leaves. She smiles slightly, then turns and 
               puts the key into the door and opens it.

               Featuring the door. REGGIE enters, then stops abruptly, the 
               doorknob still in her hand.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
               The room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is 
               HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat.

               He starts slowly advancing toward REGGIE.

                         I don't know -- I don't know! I don't --

               She stops as she sees something.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND
</b>
               Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one.

<b>               WIDER ANGLE
</b>
               SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, 
               then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.

<b>                                     SCOBIE
</b>                         I want it -- give it to me -- it's 
                         mine!

               The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly, 
               turns and flies out.

<b>                                     REGGIE

                         Peter -- ! Peter -- !

<b>               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT
</b>
               As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal 
               hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and 
               splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified 
               with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding 
               claw.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
               As PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand.

</b>                         A man -- he tried to kill me!

               Pulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the 
               outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using 
               all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, 
               making sure to hold it that way as he steps in.

<b>               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
               Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled 
               SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but 
               he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, 
               sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, 
               head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he 
               disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door 
               and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free.

               He then rushes to the open window and climbs out.

<b>               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT
</b>
               REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly 
               looks into the room.

               Showing the disarranged room, empty of people. Then, slowly 
               PETER's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily.

               REGGIE rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed.

               PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks 
               out. He then turns back.

                         be back in a minute.

                         You took the words right out of my

               Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, 
               consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between 
               it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears 
               and looks down over the railing.

               SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it 
               is too far to jump.

<b>               MED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY
</b>
               He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on 
               one side, but there are two or three on the other.

               PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one 
               hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony.

               PETER leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing 
               on his way to the next balcony. As he does, the following 
               exchange is heard (in British English).

               As PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes 
               the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, 
               then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one 
               of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- 
               and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock 
               has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down 
               near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of 
               the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the 
               thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it 
               underneath.

</b>                         Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned 
                         on spending the entire night here.

</b>                         Yes. The five men. They were, of 
                         course, your husband, Charles, the 
                         three men who showed up at his funeral 
                         yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But 
                         something went wrong and they were 
                         unable to locate their contact. It 
                         must have been at that point that 
                         they decided to steal the money.

</b>                         By burying it, and then reporting 
                         that the Germans had captured it.  
                         All they had to do was come back 
                         after the war, dig it up and split 
                         it five ways -- a quarter of a million 
                         dollars with no questions asked.

                         May I have a cigarette, please?

               BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at 
               it and rips off the filter tip. He winces.

                         drinking coffee through a veil.

               She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches 
               and lights it.

</b>                         Everything went smoothly enough until 
                         after the gold was buried -- then, 
                         before they could get out, they were 
                         ambushed by a German patrol. A machine 
                         gun separated Scobie from his right 
                         hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full 
                         in the stomach.

               REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the 
               filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth.

</b>                         What's wrong with that one?

               He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically 
               brand-new in the ashtray.

</b>                         Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened 
                         then?

               She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly 
               examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first 
               cigarette.

</b>                         Carson was dying so they were forced 
                         to leave him. They finally got back 
                         to the base, made their report, and 
                         waited for the war to end. Only 
                         Charles couldn't wait quite as long 
                         as the others. He beat them back to 
                         the gold, took everything for himself 
                         and disappeared. It's taken Gideon,

               DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment 
               later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches 
               DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the 
               hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding 
               her from view.

<b>               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, 
               then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns 
               off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE 
               passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the 
               middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and 
               turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, 
               and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her 
               way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, 
               her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged

               The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, 
               looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and 
               she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she 
               smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it.

               He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her.

               REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.

               The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he

               rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused 
               TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some

               As SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks

               DYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing 
               at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes 
               to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him.

               Finding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE 
               removes it. During the following conversation he will shake 
               open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out 
               onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE.  
               Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand.

               beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of 
               roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into 
               a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely 
               separated oval-shaped dormer windows.

               Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven

</b>                         You're out, Dyle -- right now!

               SCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE.

</b>                         Step back.

               DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a 
               sheer drop to the street.

<b>                                     DYLE
</b>                         Back where?

</b>                         That's the idea.

               Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand 
               with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.

               Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the 
               jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around 
               DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.

               Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and, 
               unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of 
               the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE 
               suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold 
               is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his 
               back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound 
               extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.

               Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and 
               leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple 
               with one another, each trying to break free and reach for 
               the gun.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS

               Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.

               The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are 
               beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to 
               stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by 
               both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold 
               him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, 
               continues to inch forward toward the gun.

               Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining 
               him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his 
               momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, 
               where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the 
               slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.

</b>
               As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching 
               sound and causing sparks to fly.

</b>
               As he slides over the edge and disappears.

</b>
               As he watches, hypnotized.

</b>
               There appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN 
               FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the 
               rain gutter at the very edge.

<b>               MED. SHOT -- DYLE
</b>
               Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of 
               the level part of the roof.

</b>
               As he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal 
               hand.

               He finds it hard to believe.

                         side of the building.

               DYLE turns and leaves going down the stairs.

               The HOTEL MANAGER is busy taping a piece of cardboard over 
               the hole ripped in REGGIE's door by SCOBIE's metal hand the 
               night before. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own 
               door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE "takes" the look.

               REGGIE, smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears DYLE moving 
               about in his room. She goes to the connecting door, unlocks 
               her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his 
               side and knocks.

</b>                         Take off your shirt and lie down.

               As REGGIE goes to the bathroom, DYLE takes off his torn shirt, 
               revealing a torn and bloody T-shirt. He lies face downwards 
               on the bed. REGGIE returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape, 
               scissors, and disinfectant. She sits next to him and lifts 
               up his T-shirt to examine the wound.

               She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning 
               the wound. He winces.

               talk as she continues kissing him.

               CLOSE SHOT -- JEAN-LOUIS. He looks around, uncertainly, first 
               one way, then the other. CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him sitting 
               on SCOBIE's knee, the large man holding him with his good 
               hand, the metal one in his pocket. TEX sits next to them 
               while GIDEON nervously paces the floor. When GIDEON begins 
               sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket 
               and downs one or two, swallowing some water.

               She smiles, takes JEAN-LOUIS' hand and leaves. DYLE turns to 
               survey TEX's room.

               He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and 
               the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the 
               desk and opens the drawers -- also empty. The bureau is next -- 
               he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are 
               completely empty. Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens 
               it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare.

               Then, CAMERA PANNING DOWN, he sees the only thing he's found 
               so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots.

               Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands 
               on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything, 
               by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand

               A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now

               and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of 
               mutual affection. Some are embarrassed, some are amused and 
               some (the most intimate) damn annoyed. One even shakes his

               The room is dark and the phone is ringing. He switches on 
               the lamp, looks at the clock (it reads 3:30) and shakes his

               He hangs up, swings his feet out of bed and spears his 
               slippers, reaching for his robe at the same time. Then he 
               shuffles sleepily to the door.

               The cage is there. He opens the door and enters.

               GIDEON closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The 
               cage starts down. GIDEON begins sneezing. Suddenly the 
               elevator stops between floors and the lights go out.

               Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts 
               moving down again. GIDEON shakes his head and leans back, 
               whistling again. The cage comes to his floor and starts past

               The NIGHT PORTER is asleep behind the desk. The elevator,

               and keeps right on going, toward the basement.

               The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is 
               a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes 
               that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely 
               awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking 
               horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He 
               presses the call button and the motor starts.

               An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER 
               opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES 
               PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor 
               of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a 
               puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no

               "DIRECTION: Pte D'ORLÉANS Pte DE CLIGNANCOURT-------"

               Choosing "Clignancourt," she runs off. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY, 
               180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot 
               pursuit.

<b>               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT
</b>
               REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every 
               few steps.  Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across 
               the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.  He has evidently 
               made the wrong turn back in the passageway.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  Then the bell rings, 
               announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back 
               through the exit behind him. Not knowing what to do, REGGIE 
               looks into the darkness of the tunnel. The approaching train 
               can be heard.

<b>                                     REGGIE

                         Come on -- please --

               She turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door 
               starts to close. As it does, the train roars into the station.

<b>               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT
</b>
               The gate can be seen slowly closing. ADAM runs to it, tries 
               to force it back but cannot. Finally, he jumps up and, 
               commando style, vaults over it.

<b>               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT
</b>
               REGGIE is just entering the red center car (the two on either 
               side are dark green). ADAM runs for the red car and just 
               manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches 
               falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing 
               to inform the motor-man to depart. The train starts to move.

<b>               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT
</b>
               The entire length of the car separates ADAM and REGGIE.

               For a moment, their eyes meet, then ADAM starts to weave his 
               way past the other PASSENGERS, on his way to her.

               Suddenly, he is stopped. ADAM turns to see a TRAIN GUARD.

</b>                         Billet, Monsieur.

               ADAM shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but 
               again the TRAIN GUARD stops him.

</b>                         But that's what they gave me.

               He tries to pull away from the TRAIN GUARD and finds himself 
               staring into the serious face of a GENDARME.

<b>                                     GENDARME

               ADAM looks at the GENDARME, then at REGGIE.

               The GENDARME opens the door for ADAM and escorts him out.

               ADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes. She remains 
               in the car.

<b>               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT
</b>
               The GENDARME gestures for ADAM to enter the green, second- 
               class car behind the red, first-class one. Reluctantly, ADAM 
               does.

               As ADAM enters and goes to the door through which he can see 
               REGGIE in the car ahead. She is gone. Moving quickly, he 
               returns to the exit door and looks at the platform.

               Featuring ADAM as he hurries from the car. He finds his way 
               blocked by FIVE NUNS in large, white butterfly hats.

               It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around 
               them.

               REGGIE has entered an area leading to the exit. But as she 
               reaches the stairway leading up to the street level, she is 
               confronted with an iron grill barring her way. She tries to 
               open it, but it is firmly padlocked. A sign hung on it reads 
               "FERMÉ LES WEEKENDS." She turns, desperately looking for 
               some way out.

<b>               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is off the train. He stands on the platform as the train 
               doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and 
               the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions, 
               looking for some sign of REGGIE. He spots the exit marked 
               "SORTIE" (the same one used by REGGIE) and starts toward it.

               sign of REGGIE. He goes to the locked grill and tries it, 
               testing the padlock. CAMERA PANS to a phone booth (solid 
               door with a window in the upper half) and we see REGGIE's 
               hand reaching up to dial a number.

<b>               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE sits on the floor of the booth, dialing.

               She holds the receiver to her ear. The number can be heard 
               ringing but no one answers. She hangs up and reaches for the 
               phone book, leafing through its pages.

               Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs

               his own gun.

               (NOTE: Both "BARTHOLOMEW" and ADAM are in among the stone 
               columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of 
               each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps 
               in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to).

                         We all know Carson Dyle is dead, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

                         Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic. 
                         He's trying to trick you again.

               REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.

</b>                         Tex recognized him -- that's why he 
                         said Dyle. If you give him those 
                         stamps, he'll kill you too!

               REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM.

                         you right now?

               REGGIE stops, turns back to "BARTHOLOMEW."

</b>                         Because he'd have to come out to get 
                         the stamps -- he knows he'd never 
                         make it.

                         every lie he tells you? He wants the

                         ever wanted.

               She looks toward ADAM for a moment, then back to 
               "BARTHOLOMEW", then slowly starts toward ADAM.

                         bullets to kill me. They left me 
                         there with five of them in my legs

                         ten months in a German camp -- with 
                         nothing to stop the pain and no food -- 
                         they were willing to take all these 
                         chances for the money, but not for 
                         me. They deserved to die!

               During the following, he looks around, looking for some way 
               out.

                         more blood won't matter.

               During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, 
               creeping cautiously across the open space between the two 
               colonnades and finally, behind the second.

               With CARSON in the b.g., who fires at him. ADAM ducks behind 
               the column as the bullet hits it and screams off.

               Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot.

<b>               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Seeing CARSON otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward 
               the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her.

               (Beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming 
               schedule of presentations.)

               Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door, 
               turns and fires at her. But he is too late -- she is safely 
               inside. CARSON looks quickly back toward ADAM, then takes 
               off after REGGIE.

               Over his shoulder we see a broken picture of CARSON running 
               toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns.  
               ADAM tries to get a shot at him, but can't.

               ADAM arriving at the door, bangs on it, then looks around, 
               frustrated. Several yards away he sees a short stairway 
               leading down to a door below the street level. He runs to

               A large room, lit by a single bare bulb, under the stage.

               ADAM appears, moving cautiously, gun ready. He creeps along 
               next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic 
               pieces which fill the room.

               DOWN to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box.  
               Inside, huddling down, is a terrified REGGIE, holding her

               sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up. He goes to it, 
               and, starting up, finds a door. He tries the knob -- the

               REGGIE, cringing back from the bright light, notices the

               CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery,

               It is divided into thirty-six square sections, each numbered

               ADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He

               CARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when 
               suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through 
               out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot.

<b>                                         CHARADE
</b>
                      Music by Henry Mancini, Words by Johnny Mercer

               When we played our Charade we were like children posing, 
               Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we 
               played.

               Oh, what a hit we made. We came on next to closing Best on 
               the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade.

               Fate seemed to pull the strings, I turned and you were gone.

               While from the darkened wings the music box played on.

               Sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing, I hear it 
               still, I always will, best on the bill Charade.
