<b>    FADE IN:
</b>
<b>1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1
</b>
    Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET
    LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full
    moon.

<b>                             WATSON (V.O.)
</b>               The year was 1891. London was the
               capital of the world -- the height
               of modernity, with the hiss of
               steam and smell of coal in the
               air. It was also the great
               cesspool into which all the
               sinners and criminals of the
               empire drained.

    Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a
    POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making
    his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.

<b>                             WATSON (V.O.)
</b>               I had come to London, ten years
               prior, to find a life after the
               Afghan war. I had hoped to start
               a medical practice and settle into
               a nice, steady existence. The
               life I found was anything but nice
               and steady.

    We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive
    silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A
    FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.
    The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing
    stampede.

<b>                             WATSON (V.O.)
</b>               And that had everything to do with
               one man. My friend, my partner,
               my burden...

    The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the
    impression that he knows something that we don't.

<b>                             WATSON (V.O.)
</b>               ... Sherlock Holmes.

    WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by
    A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,
    his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.

</b>    The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
    just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies
    it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he
    recognizes his famous assailant.

<b>                            MAN
</b>              Sherlock Holmes?!

    SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the
    MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken
    umbrella.

<b>                            HOLMES
</b>              My apologies. Send the bill to
              John Watson, 221B Baker Street.

    Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN
    takes a step into the road to watch him go --

    -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a
    number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious
    pursuit, Victorian-style.

</b><b>    INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT
</b>    inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a
    19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,
    older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.

    A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:
    DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in
    the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A
    thinking man of action.

<b>3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3
</b>
    Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the
    Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the
    river.

    As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the
    carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot
    follow.

<b>                                                           CUT TO:

<b>    ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
    Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and
    runs across a courtyard to a side door.

    WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.
<b>
</b><b>                                                    3.

</b>

<b>5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5
</b>
    Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a
    stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but
    not as fit as he used to be.

    Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral
    staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers
    round the corner.

    A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards
    Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the
    door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying
    the lantern and a gun.

    He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the
    shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his
    black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the
    lantern away again. He peers about, confused.

    We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his
    jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.

<b>                            HOLMES (V.O.)
</b>              Head cocked to the left, partial
              deafness in right ear. First
              point of attack.


<b>    PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED
</b>
    FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the
    top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes
    launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400
    fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's
    head is thrown back as he spins round.

<b>                            HOLMES (V.O.)
</b>              Then throat, paralyze vocal
              chords, stop screaming.

    BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We
    RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck
    with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.

<b>                            HOLMES (V.O.)
</b>              Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --
              knuckles to liver.

    BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating
    knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted
    thug and crumples him to his knees.

</b><b>    SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE
</b>
    Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we
    can barely see what he's doing.

    THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.
    CRACK! Karate chop to throat.
    WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.

    BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,
    Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it
    onto his own in one super fast move.

    Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his
    lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.


<b>    POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE
</b>
    Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the
    staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his
    gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the
    post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the
    shadows.

<b>                            THUG
</b>              What's goin' on, John?

    When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where
    we saw Holmes hide.

    But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,
    reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips
    him twice with his own gun, dropping him.

    Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and
    sniffs it appreciatively.

<b>                            HOLMES
</b>              Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you
              work for?

    He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the
    man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the
    crypts.

</b><b>    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight.
    Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when --

    A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder.    PULL BACK to
    reveal --

    (The following exchange in whispers.)

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>              Watson.    Perfect timing.

<b>                              WATSON
</b>              Nice hat.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>              Just got it.    Where's Lestrade?

<b>                            WATSON
</b>              Getting his troops in formation.
              Is that your blood or theirs?

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>              I don't know.    It's an old shirt.

<b>                            WATSON
</b>              You left this behind.

    Watson hands him his pistol.    Holmes looks at it with
    distaste, doesn't take it.

<b>                            HOLMES
</b>              Knew I'd forgotten something.
              Thought I'd left the stove on.

     using headbutts, knees, and elbows. Less artful, but no
     less effective.

     Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a
     chilling sight.

<b>     A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE
</b>     (five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner.
     Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has
     been placed at her feet.

     A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the
     pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his
     face.

     ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony,
     shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.

     Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if
     pulled to her feet by invisible hands.

     Some kind of ritual is about to climax.

     Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they
     make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo.

</b><b>     INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS
</b>     The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the
     shadows.

     Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly,
     Latin incantation repeating and repeating.

     ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the
     incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.

     Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's
     level.

     Blackwood simply ignores them.   The Latin incantation
     never stops.

     Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood.

<b>                             WATSON
</b>               The girl.

</b>     The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness,
     picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to
     plunge the point into her heart.

     Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and
     pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.

     Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a
     rush of air departs the tunnel.

     Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face.
     His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark
     and cruel.

     Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity.

<b>                             WATSON
</b>               Lord Blackwood?!
     Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.

<b>                             BLACKWOOD
</b>               Well done, Holmes. And Watson as
               well.

     Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood.

<b>                             WATSON
</b>               Stay right there.

     Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost
     mockingly.

<b>                             BLACKWOOD
</b>               Tell me, doctor, as a medical man,
               how did you like my work?
                    (beat)
               The fifth one was so scrawny, it
               was over before I'd finished the
               first incision.

     That's more than Watson can take.   He moves in to pistol-
     whip Blackwood --

     -- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his
     collar.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               No.

     Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.

     sees nothing.

<b>                               HOLMES
</b>               Look.

     Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide.

     INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end
     of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost
     invisible --

     -- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.    A
     really nasty concealed weapon.

     One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.

<b>                               BLACKWOOD
</b>               What a shame.    That would've been
               fun.

     We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his
     men finally appear.

     POLICEMEN flood the area.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>                    (re: girl)

                    (re: Blackwood)
               And one for the rope.

<b>                             LESTRADE
</b>               You should've waited for my help.

<b>                             HOLMES

      Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him,

     As Watson exits his apartment and moves down the hall,
     MRS. HUDSON, his landlady, shoots up the stairs with the

     towards them.

     Mrs. Hudson's already-frayed nerves take a turn for the

     himself. Something    like this has happened before (is, in
     fact, Holmes' usual   brand of chaos) the difference being,
     now, that Watson is   sick to death of dealing with it.

     Which doesn't mean he won't.

     in, cautiously. He sees --

     obstruction is Holmes who is sitting in the dark on a               
     chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd

     in.

     Holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for Watson
     to arrive. He is quite uncomfortable in this setting.

     WE SEE HIS OBSERVATIONS -- he picks up little pieces of
     information from the other guests. He notices the
     details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a
     bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters.
     It all becomes quite overbearing.

     And then Watson and Mary arrive, talking, intent on each
     other -- surprised when they realize Holmes is already
     there.

<b>                              WATSON

<b>                             WATSON
</b>               May I present Miss Mary Morstan.

     Holmes looks at MARY MORSTAN -- looks again. She's
     beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying.
     Holmes stands. She extends her hand.

               introduced.

     Holmes gestures politely, they sit, Mary and Watson on
     either side of him. There is a decanted bottle of wine
     on the table.

               And neat, like all military men.
               Then I check his pockets... ah. A
               stub from a boxing match. Now I

     Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes.
     Holmes pauses... pauses, then:

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               You were engaged.

     Holmes' mind has gotten away from him.   He begins talking
     faster, intensely focused, manic.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               The ring is gone. But the lighter
               skin where it sat suggests you

               proudly.

     As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to
     her feet. They're leaving.

               off the engagement and returned to

               doctor perhaps.

     Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The

<b>                                 HOLMES
</b>                 She's lovely.

       Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down
       his face.

       Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high.
       The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds
       his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt,
       spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to
       cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around.


<b>       HOLMES' POV
</b>
       Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly,
       Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving.
       The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine
       china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --

       -- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a
       fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.

</b><b>       NIGHT
</b>
       Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own
       blood from a split lip. It interests him.
       He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His
       opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists
       together and moves in.

       Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.


<b>       HOLMES' POV
</b>
       The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and
       indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his
       experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him,
       the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.

</b>       He's able to feel, not just think.    He is utterly in the
       moment.

       Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to
       his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning
       to move his head so that a punch grazes him.


<b>       BACK TO SCENE
</b>
       McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes
       ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes
       even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect
       himself.

       Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches
       McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an
       obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely
       in control --

       -- until he notices a face at ringside.


<b>       CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
</b>
       Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a
       slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective.

       Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound
       floods back into the room.

       McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and
       steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --

       He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.

       Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the
       cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns
       back to McMurdo, smiles.

<b>                                HOLMES
</b>                 Well done.   Thank you.

       Holmes begins walking away.

                                McMURDO
                 Oi!   We ain't done here.

</b>       Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and
       SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back
       of the head. The crowd falls silent.

       Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his
       hand.

<b>                                  HOLMES
</b>                   Hm.   Plymouth gin.

       He turns.   Steps back into the ring.

       The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from
       Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning
       McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:

       A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo
       braces for combat --

       Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,
       incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding
       combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big
       man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.

       McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning
       away before the giant hits the canvas.

       He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they
       like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.

       Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes
       strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed
       inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge
       swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.

</b>     Watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. With a
     look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes
     sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room.

     Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his VIOLIN.
     On the table next to him, an upside down BEER STEIN and
     an assortment of prescription medicine bottles.

     Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from
     lack of sleep.

     Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.

               what a black reaction comes on you

     No answer. More scales. Watson approaches, sees Holmes
     has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep. The beer stein is
     full of FLIES all buzzing about.

     Watson and Holmes ride in a cab, passing familiar
     landmarks as the city comes to life. They sit in
     silence, tension hanging between them. Finally Holmes
     grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean
     white shirt.

     Watson looks out the window, frustrated. He sees THE
     HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE. Near ground
     level, workers take down a large BLACKWOOD STEEL sign.

                 and suspension bridge. Very

     No reply.

<b>                             HOLMES

               with some interest and while my
               heart went out to the families of
               the victims, I couldn't but notice

               in the crypt was akin to a finger
               painting.

     Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to
     Holmes.

<b>                             BLACKWOOD

               afoot, and that's why you're
               really here.

               anything earthly has led to this

               is to assume I've been holding the
               brush at all -- I am merely the
               channel.

     Despite the bars between them, the men are close
     together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear.

     cracking walnuts. She stands and Holmes watches her                
     every move as she crosses to him. She leans down,                  
     putting the walnuts in front of him and flashes him a              
     smile.

     Irene gets up to cross the room. Only once her back is             
     turned does Holmes lever himself upright, stunned by this          
     intrusion. As soon as she clears he quickly moves over             
     to a concealed safe. He tests the door to make sure it's

     the opposite corner of the carriage. Before she can
     speak, a gesture from the shadow stills her. This is

     Irene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a
     complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the
     paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL

     slides the folded paper partway out.

     Someone waiting outside takes the paper, and their
     footsteps clatter away.

     Moriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts
     moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene,
     finally prepared to engage with her.

       Once Irene leaves, he steps quickly to a window, and
       looks out to see her walking down Baker Street, turning
       down an alley. He bolts    into --

       Holmes flies from the window and lands neatly on a tin
       roof. The jump to the next level is a more taxing

      man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to
      grab her --

      -- and WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! Gets three cosh-strikes across
      the chin, dropping him immediately.

      Still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up
      against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth.

      Quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp
      knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to
      his collar. The move ends with Irene's finger over her

      eyes bulging.

      Irene frisks him expertly. She's mugging the mugger.
      There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on.

</b>      Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene
      through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled.

      Holmes picks up the pace.

      He snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his
      hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin
      and snatches the beggar's eye patch too.

      He runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it
      on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews
      it to blacken his teeth.

      He pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a

     Generations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble

     Police lamps light one large marble CRYPT. The cops are
     in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked.
     They'd rather be anywhere but here.

     As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors

     Watson heads for him.   Holmes disappears in the opposite
     direction.

     As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over
     to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in
     each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want

     There's a clunk. They all turn to see the coffin has
     been extracted from the crypt.

     Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin.
     They place it on the ground, step back, crossing

     forward --

     levers it off with a slow, eerie groan.

     Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward.

     The coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush
     away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the
     coffin. The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood,

     Lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned.
     Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth,
     revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw.

     Holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled
     pocket. He uses the pen to fish out: a POCKET WATCH.

<b>                             HOLMES

     Holmes hands the pen back to Lestrade. Lestrade looks at
     it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a
     small measure of revenge.

     Holmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his

     at them. As they dodge and swing back --

     Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as
     a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a
     dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a
     CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye:

     He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the
     heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it
     so the curtain-rings rain to the floor.

     He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's
     face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly --

     Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his

      butting one, kicking the other in the groin.

      The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades
      flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices
      his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so --

      The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs
      accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground.

      As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man
      HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade,
      which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson
      fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring.

      Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by

      Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.    Holmes
      cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums.

      Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on

               your violin playing at three in

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               That was an accident...

     Watson challenges him with a look.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               The first time WAS an accident...

<b>                             BIG MAN (O.S.)
</b>               Remember me, boys? Put me away
               for robbery a few years back?

     Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous-
     looking man who has a few conspicuous WARTS on his face.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth
               most dangerous man in London.

     Watson snaps at the man.

<b>                             WATSON
</b>               Who could forget that face? I
               told you, a little nitrate of
               silver and the warts will be gone
               in two weeks. Now, if you'll
               excuse us!

     Brownlee takes a swing at Watson. Holmes checks him and
     drops Brownlee without missing a beat.

</b>               What you need is a rest. You and

               My brother Mycroft has a small

     Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary.
     She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson.
     The bars slide shut.

     The mob surrounds Holmes.   He's never looked more alone.

     The hood is pulled off. Holmes takes in the scene, eyes
     flicking around the room.

     He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR
     THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers.

<b>                              SIR THOMAS
</b>                Mr. Holmes, apologies for
                summoning you like this. I'm sure
                it's quite a mystery as to where
                you are, and who I am.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                As to where I am -- I was,
                admittedly, lost for a moment
                between Charing Cross and Holborn.
                But I was saved by the bread shop
                on Saffron Hill, the only bakers
                to use a certain French glaze on
                their loaves. After that, the
                carriage forked left, then right,
                a bump over the Fleet conduit --
                need I go on?

     Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                As to who you are -- that took
                every ounce of my not-
                inconsiderable experience and
                skill... the letters on your desk
                are addressed to Sir Thomas
                Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice.
                That would be your official title.
                Who you realy are is another
                matter entirely.

     Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is
     on a roll.

     standing behind him. Standish is an American in his
     sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s.

     isn't impressed by rank.

</b>               Be as skeptical as you like -- but
               our secret systems have steered
               the world towards the greater good

               they can also be exploited for

<b>                             SIR THOMAS
</b>               He was conceived during one of our

               She was a powerful practitioner.
               Though not enough to survive
               giving birth to him.

     Holmes is appalled and shows it.

<b>                             SIR THOMAS
</b>               We were young. It was before we

     Sir Thomas hands Holmes a TINTYPE. A photograph from the
     1860s. It's chilling: a death scene, a BODY covered by
     a sheet. A man who's just fallen out a window. A TEN-
     YEAR-OLD BOY -- young Lord Blackwood -- looks on.

     Holmes looks at Coward with scathing disdain.

     of the massive hotel that's bustling with people.

     Irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress. She
     pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at
     a mirrored dressing table. There's a decanter on the
     table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of
     wine.

     Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of
     WEAPONS hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from
     her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she
     puts down next to the wine glass). She pulls long thin
     needles from her hair, lets her hair down. As she
     continues...

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Holmes watching her from a shadowy
     corner. He looks on silently until:

<b>                             IRENE
</b>               If you're going to watch me take
               my clothes off, Sherlock, the

               the buttons.

               offense, Sherlock, and could get
               you into a lot of trouble...

     They both eye the Derringer on the table.

<b>                             IRENE
</b>               So why don't you come over here
               and help me instead.

     Holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches
     for the top button on the back of her dress.

<b>                                IRENE
</b>               That's better.

     Irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers.

</b>               Wonderful. Case closed then.
               Your services are no longer
               required.

     Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               I can't help wondering if your
               employer will be as content with
               these results? You were
               uncharacteristically ill at ease
               in his presence. Your hand was
               trembling, your gaze was averted.
               I couldn't see his face, but I
               spotted chalk on his lapel. A
               professor perhaps?

     Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN.

</b>                    (behind screen)
               The eye patch was a nice touch.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               But I've never known a professor
               to carry a gun, and on such a
               clever contraption.

<b>                             IRENE (O.S.)

</b>               We're not.

     Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian
     undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND
     still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing
     table.

     Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on.

     Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his
     case vehemently.

</b>               When a man you ask me to find ends
               up dead in the coffin of the most
               notorious murderer since Jack the
               Ripper and that murderer manages
               to return from the dead, not only
               is it my business, it's the
               business of Scotland Yard and the
               highest levels of the British
               government. They will certainly
               consider your reticence to be an
               obstruction of justice. Which in
               relation to a crime of this
               magnitude would certainly mean
               prison time.

</b>               This wine is excellent.    You
               should really try some.

     Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the
     wine bottle.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               So what's it to be?

     Irene reaches for the wine.

</b>               You're in over your head this
               time, Irene.

     Irene snatches up her gun.    Holmes grabs her arm.

     BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe.
     Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses
     him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else.
     Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that
     disarms Holmes.

     The kiss leads them to the bed.

               key.

     She gets off him.

     While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually
     across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING.
     She's in charge now.

     Can't. Not all the way.

      Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As
      Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --

<b>                              CONSTABLE CLARK
</b>                We've checked everything. No sign
                of a break-in. The Butler didn't
                hear anything. The body was in
                the tub, eyes wide open --
      -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.

                -- only his ring was missing.

      He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right
      back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode.
      Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best
      -- this is, in fact, why he exists.

      Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues
      into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the
      tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).

      The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene
      violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.

                Crime is common, logic is rare.
                The decent thing to do is catch
                the killer, not provide comfort to
                the corpse.

      Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes
      swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to
      the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up,
      opens it, sniffs it.

<b>                                HOLMES

      Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.

                be in the pantry, high up where
                it's warm and dry, or in a linen
                closet with a vent. And,
                Constable, you could check the
                ground under the rear windows for
                any footprints not your own.

      Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.

</b>                Data, data, data! I cannot make
                bricks without clay!

      The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to
      work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's-
      eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill.
      Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.

      Holmes is happy.

      He glances around the room, sees the chair where
      Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself.

      steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust.
      The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.

      Holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM
      POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing:

      He pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to
      reveal a SECRET ROOM. Holmes enters --

      texts, spellbooks, one book open to a picture of
      Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward --

      An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar,
      four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's
      BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.

      Holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of
      paper, just as --

      They are startled by the secret room --

      -- they are even more startled by the sight of Holmes
      kneeling at the altar and singing to himself.

      As soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and
      walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words.

      A five-sided room. A few dozen venerable-looking

      stands next to a central throne. He stays standing as

      Blackwood enters. He looks as if he's been to hell, and
      come back more powerful than ever.

      An industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't
      stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into
      the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK
      FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water.

      Just above the thump of industry we can hear a
      distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a
      decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO
      VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man
      in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER.

                long in the Navy.

      Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope.
      He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The
      engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers:

     mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does.

     They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the
     river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more
     THUGS are loading the boat with something.

     Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance,

     instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay

     through it.

     his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it.
     Quiet:

</b>               They cleared something out of
               here, not minutes ago...

     Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects
     it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore.

<b>                              WATSON (O.S.)
</b>               Holmes.   You need to see this.

     Holmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of
     doors.

     TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson,
     stepping into --


<b>90   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - FACTORY FLOOR                90
</b>
     A massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly
     gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now.
     An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the
     killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I-
     beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the
     wind.

     On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118.

<b>                               WATSON
</b>               One-eighteen.    It's a date, a
               time?

     Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.

<b>                             HOLMES
</b>               It's chapter and verse.
               Revelation 1:18. `I am He that
               liveth, and was dead.'

     Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:

<b>                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
</b>               `And behold, I am alive
               forevermore, and have the keys of
               hell and of death. Amen.'

     Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in
     the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and
     Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in
     the flesh.
<b>                              BLACKWOOD
</b>                I cautioned you to accept that
                this is beyond your control. Now
                you see the truth for yourself.

     The hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely.
     Holmes tightens. Blackwood continues, his voice echoes,
     as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.

<b>                             BLACKWOOD
</b>               I want you to bear witness. At
               noon tomorrow, the world as you
               know it ends.

     Watson pulls his gun, draws a bead on Blackwood, pulls
     the trigger. Click. Misfire.

                help, Holmes, I have a gift for
                you.

      Holmes starts climbing up towards Blackwood.

<b>                              BLACKWOOD

                She followed you. You led your
                little lamb straight to slaughter.

      Suddenly the whole machine starts up. Industrial-
      strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking
      towards the processing line. Blades and gears and
      grinders churn.

      Watson's eyes go from Blackwood to --

      A pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing
      area, towards the SCORCHER (which scorches the carcasses
      with live flame).

      Then next carcass emerges --

      -- not a carcass, Irene. She is alive, for now. She
      hangs from two hooks on a track-line, her wrists shackled
      above her, her mouth gagged.

      Her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense
      relief for a moment, then determination.

      Holmes looks up to see Blackwood's shadow retreating.

      Decision time.

<b>90A                                                                90A
</b><b>      INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ASSEMBLY LINE
</b>      Holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to
      gear like stepping-stones. He heaves himself up to the
      conveyor, where Irene is being pulled down the assembly
      line towards the flames.

      Watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut-off switch.

      Holmes unties Irene's gag.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                It's your turn in shackles this

      Ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an
      overwhelming burst of flame. Holmes and Irene are next.

                unfortunately.

      Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate
      hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her.

      The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the
      next blast.

      Watson sees a LEVER (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) that looks
      promising, turns to head for it -- then his eyes focus on
      a big canvas splatter cloth.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                I've been meaning to ask you
                something --

<b>                              IRENE
</b>                Well, I'm a captive audience.

      Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes
      and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to
      Holmes --

      -- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the
      flames hit them.

      The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them.

      Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops
      away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just.

      Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit!" he
      looks ahead --

      -- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a
      long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER.

      Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try
      the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it
      all the way over --

      -- and the belt speeds up with a jerk.

      Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the
      original speed, looks around for another possible off
      switch.

      Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off
      the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's
      legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged
      into the boiling water.

      moving sideways, keeping pace with her.

</b>                     (trying her best not
                      to show the strain)
                You had a question.

      Holmes keeps hold of Irene's feet as he maneuvers past
      various obstacles --

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                     (same)
                Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain
                you're not in over your head?

<b>                              IRENE

                In some countries steam is
                considered excellent therapy for
                the skin.

      -- then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt,
      jerks away, and Irene touches the water, SCREAMS.

      Watson hears the scream, turns -- then sees something
      again. It pisses him off. Fuck this machine.

      When Holmes has Irene stable again:

<b>                              IRENE
</b>                     (weakly)
                I have to say -- it's overrated.

      Holmes has to admire her courage -- until he hears Watson
      yelling at him.

      Up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank --
      and impassable obstacle from Holmes' side of the conveyor
      belt.

      Watson points at the I-beam running above them.   Holmes
      nods. Irene sees it, too.

      Holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the I-
      beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended
      upside down by her shackles and her feet --

      -- and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water.

      Watson appears opposite Holmes, nods up at Irene.   She
      swings off the I-beam, through the air --

</b>      -- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal,
      facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of
      boiling water.

      As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant-
      looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE,
<b>      NEW PROP!)
</b>
      Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves
      her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch.

      Irene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the
      equipment, following her.

      Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes
      them.

      Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS
      HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt,
      catches up to Irene --

      -- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF
<b>      LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW.
</b>
      Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the
      lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal
      kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled.

      Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH.
      Whew!

      Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and
      pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK!

      A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps
      moving towards the giant band saw.

      Shit a brick.

<b>                              IRENE
</b>                Sherlock?

      Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces
      himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his
      might --

      -- smashes the shackle lock.

      Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her
      right hand.

      The bandsaw whines viciously.

      Irene swings aside, just misses it.

      Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she
      can free her right hand (a move not possible with both
      shackles).

      Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with
      her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME.

      Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down --

      -- sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut-
      in-half pig carcasses. They're okay.

      Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door,
      looking for Blackwood.

      Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile --

<b>                              IRENE
</b>                Thank you so much. I owe you.

      -- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.    Holmes
      grabs her, stops her.

                     (angry)
                No more games, Irene.

      She hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks
      at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth:

      He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into
      the darkness.

      Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson.
      Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something
      on the planks:

      Steel drums are dripping.    A chemical.   Holmes recognizes
      it.

      it looks as it Watson   hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is
      knocked to the ground   by the blasts and flying debris.

      Holmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and
      debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally
      knocking him to the ground.

      He reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an
      exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover --

      down, but to safety.

     The doctor injects Watson in the arm. The shot wakes
     him. Watson tries to sit up, wincing with pain.

     Watson tries to sit up again.

     respectfully, letting the Doctor do his work.

       ESTABLISHING SHOT of London, possibly the bustle of Fleet
       Street during the morning rush hour. A train crosses on
       an overhead railway.

       We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a
       splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the
       hospital is slumped down against the wall.

       We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the
       Doctor is actually Holmes.

       There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't
       completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down,
       obscuring him --

       -- but not obscuring the light of instability in his
       eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes
       them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

       Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling.

       He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's
       death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,
       hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.

       Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the
       bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the
       floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12
       o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).
       The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's
       fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).

       Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle
       around each image and a circle directly in the center of
       the four other circles. He then draws lines which join
       the circles together in the shape of a cross.

       In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from
       a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around
       that circle.

       He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)
       then stands in the center of the circle.

       He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,
       cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto
       the ground just outside the circle.

</b>     Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily
     reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting.

     Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in
     mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around
     Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that.

<b>                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
</b>               And now it dawns on you, you begin
               to recognize your part in his
               play.

     Holmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him
     within the outer circle of flame.

<b>                             BLACKWOOD
</b>               You see the path he chose for you.

     Holmes sways, fuzzy.   He struggles to focus on Blackwood.

                 resurrection. Why would I take a
                 sixth under St. Paul's?

     Holmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight.

     Holmes' head.

     WATSON -- or some deathly version of his old friend -- is
     sitting in the chair where Blackwood appeared.

     He writes something in his notebook. He is decidedly
     alive, but with burn flashes, cuts and bruises. His arm
     is in a sling. He's been through it.

     In the b.g. Irene is at the fire heating some coffee.

     now comes from upstairs.

     The fiddler's owner -- from the pub's band -- is busy

     Irene arrives with two pints, puts one down in front of

     Could it be poisoned? He wouldn't put it past her. But
     then he decides that's absurd. He takes a sip.

      it, he strums it, he makes strange atonal sounds, as he
      STARES AT THE RITUAL PATTERN he's laid out on the floor.

      Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's
      observed over the course of the investigation.

      He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor.
      Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas'
      ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal.
      Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- OX
      ring.

      Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in
      flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an
      American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped
      cane. Next to the feather he writes America.

      Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash
      to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.

      Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion --
      he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big
      question mark. Where? Who?

      Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang
      as if willing the flashes to come.

      Holmes is excited, electric.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                Now that you're sitting
                comfortably, I shall begin. My
                initial approach was far too
                narrow. When Blackwood invited me
                to Pentonville prison, he
                suggested I widen my gaze and, at
                minimum, I have done just that.
                In fact, I may well have
                reconciled thousands of years of
                theological disparity. But that's
                for another time. Blackwood's
                method is based on a ritualistic
                mystical system that has been
                employed by The Temple of the Four
                Orders for centuries. To fully
                understand this system, to get
                inside it, I re-enacted the
                ceremony we interrupted in the
                crypt... with a few enhancements
                of my own.

<b>                              WATSON

      Watson and Irene shoot Holmes knowing looks.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                My journey took me somewhat
                further down the rabbit hole than
                I had intended.

<b>                              IRENE
</b>                Yes, your little white tail got
                rather dirty.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                But I have emerged enlightened...
                The fraternity who silently
                control the Empire, share the
                belief with the Kings, Pharoahs,
                and Emperors of old that the
                Sphinx was a door to another
                dimension, a gateway to
                immeasurable power --

      He tosses Watson the pages from Sir Thomas.

</b>      He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx,
      covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body,
      Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I
                found the bone of an ox, the tooth
                of a lion, the feather of an
                eagle, the hair of a man. Map!

      Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying
      now.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                Now, it is a widely held belief
                that within the architecture of
                the great cities are coded
                references to this system.

      He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a
      cross...

      Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map)
      draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight
      through the middle of the cross that he drew on the
      floor.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                Since he rose from the grave,
                Blackwood has killed three men.
                Each murder was committed at a
                location that has a direct
                connection with the Temple,
                therefore the System.

                Reordon, the ginger midget,
                represents Man. We found his body
                here...

      He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It
      corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew
      that has the hair (6 o'clock).

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                Then Sir Thomas, Master of the
                Temple, wore the ox ring... he
                died here...

      Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the
      river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has
      the ox bone (12 o'clock).

<b>                              WATSON

      of a cross.

      All of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure

                their own good?

      Smoke fills the room so that Holmes is concealed. Coward
      pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window. He
      opens it to try and clear the smoke.

                the location of Blackwood's final

      Coward spins around and shoots at Holmes. He misses.
      Holmes runs towards the open window as Coward fires
      another shot.

      With a single bound, Holmes leaps out of the window
      Coward opened.

      Coward runs to the window and sees Holmes DIVING toward
      the river Thames, PLUMMETING down down down to --

</b>      Holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the
      surface. He grabs it with his hands. And... it pulls
      him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner.

      Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the
      rope. Irene is also present.

      When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his
      cuffs using bolt cutters. Clearly the whole escape has
      been planned. Holmes is pulled up into the boat.

<b>                              TANNER

                top window, soldier boy. No way
                he'd be coming over the terrace.

      Watson hands over the change from the engagement ring.
      Tanner takes it happily.

<b>                              WATSON
</b>                How was Lestrade?

                little too perfectly, come to
                think of it.

      Watson has the PAPER that Holmes gave him in the attic.

<b>                              WATSON
</b>                Well, your instructions were

      Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself.

      Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment.

</b>                Port side, Captain Tanner, into

      Tanner turns the boat.   Irene looks out, her eyes narrow.

</b>                Watson, did you bring my clothes?

      Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL.
      Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets
      it. He's never going to like guns.

       still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took
       from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot.

</b>                  Trust me, have a drink.

       She can see this is more than a social invitation, she
       takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson,
       Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands
       it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes
       his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers.

       Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the
       sewer. Irene follows. (Watson has his SWORD STICK and a
       GUN, Holmes has changed into the clothes Watson brought
       for him.)

       They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working
       their way around corners and through junctions back under
       the Houses of Parliament.

      flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long
      tunnel to:

      The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the
      flashback ceremony with the sword. But now:

      Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the
      pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it,
      a futuristic device:

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                Behold, Blackwood's magic.

      A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with
      electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered
      ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE.
      Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet:

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                A chemical weapon. The first of
                its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.

<b>                              WATSON
</b>                You can tell that from here?

<b>                               HOLMES
</b>                No.   I can tell it from here.
      He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                I snipped this off a rather
                recumbent rat at the
                slaughterhouse. Note the blue
                discoloration, the faint smell of
                bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs
                of cyanide.

      He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it.

<b>                              HOLMES
</b>                That shaft leads directly to
                Parliament. When activated, those
                electrodes on either side will
                send a charge converting the

       of Lords and senior Royals. As they start to take seats,

       up in the Lords' Gallery.

       They nod. Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the
       tunnel, faster and faster.

       Irene trails them closely.

       Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt.
       It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise.

       They draw their guns.
       They burst into the area, completely surprising the three
       thugs.

       Watson pistol-whips the nearest.    Holmes front-kicks the
       next.

       The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns
       before he has a chance to fight or flee.

      herds the three thugs away from the device.

<b>                              WATSON
</b>                Over there.

      Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two
      dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out). Watson
      turns so that he can watch the action at the device --

      -- which puts his back to another tunnel.

      Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife,
      looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE
      (where electric coils and circuits pulse).

<b>                              IRENE

                He must have some kind of remote
                device sending a signal to the
                receiver. Really quite --

      She reaches out with her knife and... ZAP! Her blade
      hits a coil, sparks flashing. Electrocuted, she drops
      the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by
      humming, sparking coils.

      Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes --
<b>      RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON --
</b>
      Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both
      hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson.

      Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed
      from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways,
      sending both guns spinning away --

      -- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer.

      Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth-
      rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper
      cup.

      Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and
      Irene.

      Lords and Royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the
      session to begin. Coward looks up, and points, very
      emphatically.

<b>                                 LORD COWARD

      All eyes rise to see: BLACKWOOD, up in the Lords'
      Gallery. The hall goes silent, staring at a ghost.
      Blackwood is calm, commanding.

      Voices rise; Blackwood's followers move to block the
      doors as --

      BONG! The first CHIME OF NOON from Big Ben.

<b>114                                                               114
</b><b>      INT. SEWERS - DAY
</b>      The chime echoes. Dredger charges towards the device and
      Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him
      for a moment.

      It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect
      the device.

      Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to
      defuse it.

<b>      BONG!
</b>
      The second chime resounds. Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts
      him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously
      strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard
      enough to dislodge some.

      Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't
      even bother to block anything. Holmes' kicks lose steam
      as he loses air.

<b>      BONG!

                 Nine strokes left.

      Dredger grins --

      -- until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung
      with full force by Watson.

      Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding
      ears. Holmes heads back to Irene.

      Watson draws the sword from his sword stick.   Deadly
      enough, but not very big.

<b>                               WATSON
</b>                 You owe me for the ring.

      Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only
      until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial
      sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more
      uneven than usual.

<b>      BONG!
</b>
      As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts
      all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay --

      -- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the
      cradle by two RODS. His eyes narrow, a plan forming.

<b>                               HOLMES
</b>                 Give me your gun. The bullets, I
                 need the bullets.

      BONG!   The clock is ticking down.

      Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into
      Holmes' hand. He chops open the bullet casings with his
      knife, pouring the gunpowder into --

      -- the bowl of his pipe.

<b>      BONG!
</b>
      Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little
      sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep.

      Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword
      out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it
      out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and
      moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword
      from head to toe.

      Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword --

       While Watson is down, Dredger punts him into the sewer
       with a splash, then turns back to the device.

       Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on
       the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a
       familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are

       both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the
       device --

       -- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then
       he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and
       pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice.

       That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for

       belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES'

</b>
       BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers
       strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's
       back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the
       through-and-through) --

       Holmes and Irene stagger for the device.

       Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a
       tree.

       Watson is face-down on the stones, still.   The gun falls
       out of his limp hand.

       Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely
       avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade,
       and...

       ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade,
       redirecting the spark toward --

       Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!   The

       Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away.

       Then Holmes.

       Blackwood follows them.    Sees something on the ground
       ahead -- pauses.

       It's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous
       action with Dredger.

       Blackwood scoops it up.

</b><b>       INT. SINGLE SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
</b>       Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower --

       -- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe
       angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn
       sideways to continue.

       The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.

       And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off
       jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.
       The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick
       at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic
       gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into
       the pipe, into the unknown.

       The pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment
       it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious
       breath the only point of reference.

       This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly
       claustrophobic as it gets.

       Then, almost imperceptibly, light.

       We can make out Irene's determined profile. Light
       increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement.

       The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be
       the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new.

       Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder
       heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.

       Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other --

       shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this
       is a grind.

       defense third.

       rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off             
       the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword

       Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from            
       Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it             
       around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They                
       continue to spar, now bound.                                       

       Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes           
       simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with            
       Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.                     

       Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood            
       knocked from Irene's hand earlier).

       bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his            
       head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a

</b>       Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a
       second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind
       whips harder.

       Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting
       a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops,
       hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to
       topple.

       (NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a
       faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale
       that Holmes played earlier for his flies.)

       IN B.G.: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue
       to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a
       rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings,
       strikes another crane...

<b>                               BLACKWOOD
</b>                 Cut me loose, Holmes!

       Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully
       looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and
       dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.

<b>                               HOLMES

</b>       Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he
       releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at
       breakneck speed.

       Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on
       the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope.

       Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt.
       The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down,
       Blackwood is on his knees, cowed.

       through the floorboards --

       infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away.                     

       Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING
       CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to              
       snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther...
       and finally --

       SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around
       Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly.

       Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a
       common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet.

       Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see:
       the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy
       sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a
       cloud.

       His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things              
       that cannot be explained.

      We FOLLOW POLICEMEN heading into the sewer tunnel.

      They spread out to seal the crime scene, where Holmes had
      dismantled Blackwood's device.

</b>                We believe Sergeant Smith was the

      SERGEANT SMITH sees a POLICEMAN leaning over the device.

</b>                Oi, what you doing?

      The policeman looks up, and a GUN slides into his hand by
      means of the same device we saw in the carriage scene
      with Irene. We don't see his face.

      Holmes and Watson stand in the doorway.    A stiff beat.

      warm look, an understanding between the two men.

      looks relieved and excited.

      They climb into Constable Clarke's black mariah which
      pulls away down Baker St. We PULL BACK FROM the carriage
      WIDE and UP like our opening on Baker Street -- perhaps
      the POV of the raven.
