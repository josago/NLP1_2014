CHAPTER 1: Earth 2058
<b>---------------------
</b>

<b>FADE IN ON:
</b>
<b>EXT.-SPACE
</b>
PULL BACK slowly as MARS fills THE FRAME, a sphere of red desert and
fast rushing crimson clouds.

A triangular CARGO SHIP descends from the dark of space.

<b>                      PILOT (OVER)
</b>
          Mars mining base, this is Grissom One,
          Request final descent vector.

<b>REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
<b>EXT.-MARS
</b>
A row of giant red mountains and beneath, on the planet's surface, the
spires of A MINING BASE. Illuminated landing crosshairs alight a
landing pad, beckoning the ship.

<b>                      CONTROLLER (OVER)
</b>
          Roger, Grissom One, this is Mars
          Mining, You are cleared to land. Hope
          you got some Partagas in that rust
          bucket, Sal.

<b>EXT.-EDGE OF SPACE
</b>
THE CARGO SHIP changes attitude, landing thrusters FIRING as the
vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere.

<b>                      PILOT
</b>
          I brought you the most amazing...

Amazing, what, we'll never know. The CARGO SHIP begins to EXPLODE, the
bubble bridge BLOWING out into space in a ball of fire.

<b>EXT.- MARS
</b>
LOW ANGLE from the planet's surface-. Two shapes BLAST through FRAME,
BUBBLE FIGHTERS, single pilot, transparent globes, racing up towards
the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed.

<b>INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER
</b>
POV of the burning Cargo Ship, coming towards us incredibly fast.
Speed, trajectory and tactical readouts flash.

<b>EXT.-CARGO SHIP
</b>
The pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Two sinister ATTACK SHIPS, their lasers locked onto the Cargo Ship,
FIRE away as they BLAST overhead. The nuclear core of the Cargo Ship
overloads, the craft finally EXPLODING in a storm of fire.

A BUBBLE FIGHTER ROARS through the hurling world of flame. PUSH IN.

<b>INT.-BUBBLE FIGHTER
</b>
A lone FIGURE stands in a gyroscopic harness, working a heads-up
holographic display, command controls spinning 360 degrees with the
pilot's Comas the fighter SCREAMS after the fleeing raider.

The harness spins, the pilot coming clearly into view. Handsome,
intense, reckless eyes. MAJOR DON WEST.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Sino-Jordanian Raiders. They're
          claiming the cargo ship violated
          their air-space.

<b>INT.-SECOND BUBBLE FIGHTER
</b>
Another pilot (JEB WALKER) commands an identical craft, ROCKETING
towards the assault craft just below West's.

<b>                      JEB
</b>
          This cold war's heating up. Where did
          they come from?

<b>INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER
</b>
<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Hell. And we're going to send them
          back screaming.

West activates his targeting computer.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Last one to kill a bad guy buys the
          beer.

TARGETING DISPLAY-CLOSE. The fleeing Attack Ship jogs in and out of
the crosshairs on West's holographic array. West fires.

<b>EXT.-SPACE
</b>
The Attack Ship SHOOTS straight up, dodging West's laser BLASTS.

<b>INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER
</b>
West closes on the fleeing craft, as Jeb engages the other Attack
Ship, lasers FIRING in the b.g., visible through the transparent
surface of the bubble glass under West's feet.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          What's that sound? must be the fat lady
          warming up.

<b>EXT.-SPACE
</b>
The fleeing Attack Ship loops in mid-space, reversing direction,
heading straight towards West's Bubble Fighter. A game of chicken.

<b>INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER
</b>
West doesn't flinch. Bears down, FIRING madly, the two space ships
heading straight for each other.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          That's right. Come on, come on, you wanna
          play, I wanna play.

<b>EXT.-SPACE
</b>
The two ships are ROCKETING towards each other, locked in collision
vectors, lasers FIRING wildly.              asdasd

<b>INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER
</b>
<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I can hear her. Oh, yes, oh yes. She's
          gonna sing.

TARGETING:DISPLAY-CLOSE. The Attack Ship flashes, captured in the
targeting hatchmarks. The display expands into a tactical grid.

          Target lock.

<b>EXT.-SPACE
</b>
Imminent collision.

<b>INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER
</b>
The hull of the Attack Ship fills his bubble glass.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          The lights are dimming. The curtain's
          coming down. Sing you fat, old bag,
          sing!

West hits the firing stud.

<b>EXT.-DEEP SPACE
</b>
West's pulse lasers converge on the Attack Ship barely meters ahead,
the ROARING craft EXPLODING directly before him.

<b>INT.-WEST'S BUBBLE FIGHTER
</b>
(OVER) WEST SCREAMS as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of
flame and debris, everywhere and then gone, giving way to the
blackness of space and the starfield beyond.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Show's over.

Below, the second Attack Ship ROARS past, lasers FIRING, locked in a
pinwheel battle with Jeb's Bubble Fighter.

<b>EXT.-SPACE
</b>
JEB'S BUBBLE FIGHTER banks, avoiding the high energy volley. Almost. A
laser BURST grazes his Bubble Fighter, the surface of his craft
sparking, suddenly scored with flames.

<b>INT.-JEB'S CRAFT
</b>
The Attack ship is right behind him.

<b>EXT.-SPACE
</b>
The thruster core of Jeb's Bubble Fighter BLOWS off in a bolus of
flame, soaring back into the pursuit craft. The Raider EXPLODES.

          Saving your ass. Read towards the
          canals. Now!

The canal streaked face of the Mars is all Jeb can see. He grabs his
throttle, engages his navigational thrusters and pulls.

<b>EXT.-JEB'S SHIP
</b>
A tiny directional thruster FIRES, angling Jeb's craft so that it
scrapes the surface of Mars and dives into a giant canal, rocky walls
rushing up fast.

<b>INT.-WEST'S SHIP
</b>
West is accelerating toward Jeb.

<b>                      BASE (OVER)

West slams a switch, deactivating his radio.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Never liked that station, anyway.

He BLASTS into the canal, walls rushing up on either side of him.

<b>EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL
</b>
Jeb's tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below.

Overhead West's fighter appears, under full thrusters, roaring towards
the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle.

West angles his ship directly under Jeb.

<b>INT.-JEB'S FIGHTER
</b>
The expanding surface of Mars, visible beneath his feet, is suddenly
obscured by Don's fighter, swooping under his ship.

<b>                      JEB
</b>
          Don, abort. Abort.

<b>INT.-WEST'S FIGHTER
</b>
Jeb's fighter is visible overhead.

West going up. Don angles the throttle.

<b>EXT.-MARTIAN CANAL
</b>
Don's ship, sandwiched between the surface of Mars and Jeb's fighter,
angles up and, like a cue ball hitting it's target, Knocks Jeb's ship
spinning toward the safety of space beyond. West's ship actually
scrapes the surface of the planet, sending up a plume of Martian dust.

Maureen LAUGHS, then realizes the Principal has no idea her image is
being distorted. Maureen begins moving about the room, surreptitiously
glancing behind couches, into cabinets.

<b>                      WILL
</b>

          Maybe if I had actually broken the

          attention.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Don't let him get to you, kiddo. He

Penny tosses the rope out the window, prepares to climb.

</b>
          So, that's a no to family dinner?

<b>INT.-SPACE COMMAND-CORRIDOR

John and the General walk the metal passageway.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          We're lucky they didn't press on
          Daniels, condition.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          I figured a chance to look at the ship
          would keep the dogs at bay.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Ben, I'm worried about jamming in a
          replacement pilot at the last second.
          My family' a on this mission. I need
          someone who's more than just spit and
          polish.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          I've got your man. He just doesn't
          know it yet.

The General palms an access panel. A door hisses open to reveal...

<b>INT.-SPACE COMMAND- CONFERENCE ROOM-CONTINUOUS
</b>
A figure stands staring silently out the window. Don West. He offers a
salute. By his eyes, West is clearly agitated.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          At ease, Major.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Sir, why was I pulled off active duty?
          I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll
          fight a court martial, General.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          Do you know Professor Robinson?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          By reputation only.

          (to John)

          Your father's battle strategies were
          required reading at the Academy.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          How much do you know about the Jupiter
          Mission, Major?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          The Jupiter is fully automated. The
          pilot flies the ship out of the solar
          system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's
          a baby sitting job, sir.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          Major, you are aware Earth's resources
          are severely limited.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Every schoolchild knows our recycling
          technologies will save the
          environment. Sending a family across
          the galaxy is a publicity stunt to
          sell soda to people of all ages.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          What I am about to tell you is
          classified. Every schoolchild
          has been lied to. The recycling
          technologies have failed. In
          less than two decades Earth will be
          unable to support human life.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          We spun the ad campaign to give the
          mission a friendly face, keep people
          from panicking in the streets. We
          partnered with Coke because the 900
          billion this mission cost would have
          bankrupted the government. The
          SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth
          as well as we do. They hope to reach
          Alpha Prime first - And if they do,
          I guarantee you, they will not share
          the Dimondium with Western Demons like
          us. our crops will wither. We will be
          left to die.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          ...Captain Daniels doesn't have the
          flu, does he sir?

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          Daniels was murdered in his apartment
          last night. The flu story is a cover
          we fed the press.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Dan was a good pilot. A good man.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          Your rescue stunt over Mars was
          foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I had a friend in trouble.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          You endangered a one billion dollar
          spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order
          because of a friend?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Yes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          He'll do.

          (stepping forward)

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          Congratulations Major, you're the new
          pilot of the Jupiter mission.

CHAPTER 5: Dr. Smith
<b>--------------------
</b>

<b>EXT.-DESERT-DAY
</b>
Sun beats hard on a MAN who stands on a windswept sand dune, talking
to a smartly dressed BUSINESSMAN.

<b>                      MAN
</b>
          Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory
          lane is required. I was contracted
          to provide Daniels, apartment code.

<b>                      BUSINESSMAN

<b>                      BUSINESSMAN

<b>                      MAN

          I'm afraid my price has just become
          ... astronomical.

(OVER) a KNOCK. The man reaches forward and presses a button. The
businessman, the desert disappear, only holographs.

Room lights.

Lights come up to reveal...

<b>INT.-MISSION CONTROL-MEDICAL LABS
</b>
The man turns, revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil. This
is DR. ZACHARY SMITH. He walks to the door, palms a panel, and the
portal hiss open. A TECHNICIAN ENTERS.

<b>                      TECHNICIAN
</b>
          Control hasn't received the results
          of your final pre-flight exams,
          Doctor Smith.

The Doctor moves to a circular overhead light board around which are
displayed the faces of the crew of the Jupiter craft. Removes the
micro-files, hands them to the technician.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          The Robinsons are checked out at one
          hundred percent. They are in perfect
          condition and ready to fly.

He smiles, so sweet you can barely see the malevolence behind it.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Wish them good luck for me.

CHAPTER 6: Welcome Aboard!
<b>--------------------------
</b>

<b>INT.-SPACE COMMAND-WALKING
</b>
Three small figures walk through a gantry towards the ship.

<b>                      GENERAL (OVER)
</b>
          The mission protocols are simple.
          Professor Robinson is in command
          unless you encounter a military
          emergency. In that case, Major West,
          you will assume command.

The figures have come to the saucer entry-port.

<b>                      JOHN (OVER)
</b>
          Welcome aboard, Major.

<b>INT.-JUPITER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Don, John, and the General ENTER. Don's eyes widen.

West looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package on this
baby.

<b>REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
Hi-tech heaven. Two pilots, chairs face a giant windscreen. Don walks
to the consoles that stretch toward the back walls.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Some of this technology might be new
          to you. I'll be happy to explain.

<b>                      WEST

          Cold fusion drive

          (off the size consoles)

          Rambler-Krey Life Sciences stations.

Don strides to a pedestal in the center of the bridge. Flicks a switch
and a holographic Jupiter craft appears on the launch pad.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Holographic navigational interface.

Don points to a row of man-sized glass cylinders on the back wall.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Cryosleep array. Fully monitored.

He approaches the blast doors that lead off the back of the bridge.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Sick bay, remote Ops, engineering and
          living quarters are below decks.
          Hyperengine should be in here.

Don hits a wall panel which opens to reveal an immense ENGINE ROOM.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          If you have to baby sit, it's not
          such a bad nursery, wouldn't you
          agree, Major?

Just then the ELEVATOR rises from the lower decks. On its circular
platform stands a DOCTOR in a lab coat. She walks to the General.

<b>                      DOCTOR
</b>
          The cryosleep systems are running at
          ninety five percent.

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          Doctor Smith approved the specs-

<b>                      DOCTOR
</b>
          Doctor Smith is base physician. I am
          responsible once this ship is in
          flight. These tubes have to keep the
          crew in suspended animation for ten
          years. They will be perfect or this
          ship will not launch. Is that clear?

<b>                      GENERAL
</b>
          Absolutely, Doctor.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Judy, I'd like you to meet Major
          West. He's taking Mike's place.

<b>                      DOCTOR
</b>
          He's heavier than Mike. We'll have to
          re-calibrate.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I'd be more than happy to discuss my
          dimensions perhaps over dinner?

<b>                      DOCTOR
</b>
          West - I've read about you. Something
          of a war hero, aren't you?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          (preening )

          Well, yes, actually.

<b>                      DOCTOR
</b>
          Those who can't think, fight.

          (a freezing smile)

          Well, nice to have met you.

She heads toward the readouts. West turns to John.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          That's one cold fish I'd love to
          thaw.

<b>                      JUDY

          (turning)

          I'm not going to make it home for

West turns to John. Dad?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          It's going to be a long flight.

<b>EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT
</b>
Lights burn in the windows.

<b>INT.-ROBINSON HOME-DINING ROOM-NIGHT
</b>
John ENTERS to find the remains of an elegant dinner on the table,
candles never lit, food never eaten.

John crosses to a small scale model sitting on the table. Around it
hangs another gold plated 1st prize star. He smiles.

<b>                      MAUREEN (OVER)
</b>
          He won first prize again. He
          practically brought down his entire
          school. But he won first prize.

Maureen descends the steps in a bathrobe. Joins John.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          A non-working prototype for his time
          machine. Sharp stuff for a midget.

Maureen is silent.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I'm sorry about dinner. I had to work
          late. The new pilot-.

</b>
          Maureen. This mission is about our
          family. So we can stay together

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          The perfect nuclear family. The most
          stable social unit, ideally suited
          for the isolation of a long journey
          into space. It's all just PR, John.
          You're never home. Judy is
          becoming a ghost just like you. Penny
          can't see past her own navel and Will
          has to black out-his school, just to
          get his father's attention. The
          perfect nuclear family in ruin.

John stares at his wife. Then he reaches forward, touches her hair.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I know, Maureen. I'm scared too.

A beat. Then she moves to him. And he holds her close.

<b>INT.-ROBINSON HOME-WILL'S ROOM-NIGHT
</b>
John stands in the yellow wedge of hall light. He touches something
hanging around his own neck. A pair of metal dog tags.

<b>WIDER

Will lies in his bed, eyes closed. Asleep. A beat. John turns, heading
out into the hall.

<b>EXT.-ROBINSON HOME-NIGHT
</b>
The bedroom lights go out, a normal home against the backdrop of the
launch dome towering in the distance.

into the

A giant robot stands attached to its service bay. Still. Silent.

A SERVICE DRAWER slides open and a shadowy infiltrator emerges, his
face visible in the dim service light. Smith.

Smith approaches the docked Robot, places a small keypad device on the
Robot's dormant CPU panel. Smith activates the device.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          You'll forgive me if I forgo the
          kiss, my sleeping behemoth.

Smith hits a switch on the panel and the Robot's system indicators
light into life. Smith types several keys on the keypad.

<b>                      SMITH

Smith climbs into a chute marked WASTE DISPOSAL.

<b>INT.-WASTE DISPOSAL CHUTE
</b>
Smith begins crawling down the chute. His tiny reprogramming module
BEEPS. Smith activates a tiny, built in com-link.

From the mic, the familiar visage of the Businessman is projected into
the crawlspace over Smith's face.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          I told you never to call me here.

          goodbye.

The Businessman smiles. SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled.

Suddenly the tiny module in his hand OVERLOADS, the flesh on his palm
smoking as Smith is engulfed in an electrical charge. He goes out, his
body perfectly still.

He spins around disoriented. Stumbles to a closed view screen and hits
a stud. The blast shield opens. Space.

energy from the Robot, hitting the deck and rolling.

The Robot FIRES at the scrambling boy but misses, Will disappearing
down the gunny hatch leading to the lower decks.

DON leaps from his tube atop the Robot's back, trying to grab the
Robot's power source. The mechanical monster electrifies his shell,
sending the Major flying.

The Robot turns to Penny and Maureen. Extends his arms toward them.

Electricity arcing between his claws. The two are done for. Maureen
puts her hand over Penny's eyes.

Maureen kneels before Penny and Will, making sure they're okay. Smith
stands silently in the b.g. Judy's gurney is empty. John ENTERS, his
face wrought with fatherly concern.

          Judy? Where's Judy?

Just then Judy emerges through a door, zipping up her flight suit.

distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world. The edges of
space seem to sear away, leaving a glowing portal.

maneuver around the portal.

visible again, the giant probe ship revealed once more within...

          It's a hole in space. A doorway.

          A doorway to where?

<b>                      JOHN

          If we want to reach that ship, we're

On its hull, under the legend PROTEUS, an American flag.

<b>                      WEST

          I've never seen a design like this.
          what are those scales on her hull?

<b>                      JOHN

          What do you make of that?

Attached to the starboard docking ring is another, smaller craft. Its

waving wildly before him.

          Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Don and John are up fast. But the Robot just rolls to a stop. Will
steps from behind the automaton, his hacker's deck in his hand.

He pulls a tiny mic from his deck. Lifts it to his lips.

          Crush. Kill. Destroy.

<b>                      ROBOT

Will points to several jury-rigged modifications.

</b>
          I hacked into his CPU, bypassed his
          main operating system and accessed
          his sub-routines. He's basically
          running on remote control.

All stare at him. Penny finally speaks.

          And so the Space Captive finds
          herself helping the Robinsons by

Penny's VOICE trails off. Stares out the porthole. Endless space.

          She finds that out here, in the dark
          and cold, she's scared, and she's

Just then Don approaches, a silver bundle under his arm.

Penny steps aside.

Don smiles, winks at her, going through the door.

<b>                      WEST (OVER)
</b>
          Professor, we're ready.

John looks at his boy Will in silent.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Will, you're the most important thing
          in the world to me. I hope one day
          you'll be able to see that.

With that, John walks out. Will stares after him. Faces the Robot.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Take care of my dad, okay Robot?

Will works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge.

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP
</b>
A long dark corridor. Slowly the ambient lights come up. A door opens
to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the
docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b.g.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          The air is stale. Old.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          That's the smell of ghosts.

Don walks to a computer panel set into the wall. Begins typing.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I'm interfacing with the on board
          computer... Odd.

<b>                      JOHN

          Not working?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          No, it's just, I don't know, too
          fast. Most of the systems are down.

The Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship. The others follow. More
lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          Motion sensors are still working.

<b>                      WEST (OVER)
</b>
          What do you make of this?

Smith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Some kind of hieroglyphics.

WALL-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall.
The sketches tell a story.

HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The alien craft docks with the giant ship.

SECOND HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE-A trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter
the giant ship.

THIRD HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts
many legs. This final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red
substance. Don touches the stain.

          If I didn't know better I'd say this
          is blood.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          I know an omen when I see one. I
          suggest a hasty retreat.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Just imagine we're retreating in the
          opposite direction. Now, move it.

Don shoves Smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle, the group
heading deeper into the quiet ship.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
Will watches through the Robot's POV, toggling to move the automaton
forward. A readout marked AUDIO flashes. Will turns up a volume
control. (OVER) the sound of a slow, steady DRIP.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Dad, do you....

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP
</b>
<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          ... Hear something?

The Robot turns, begins heading further down the corridor. (OVER) now
DRIPPING can be heard by all.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Like the drip, drip, drip of blood..

<b>                      WEST

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          (pointing)

          Here.

THE CEILING shows a jagged hole, covered with some kind of viscous
membrane, leading to the dark of a service tunnel above. The membrane
DRIPS steadily onto the floor below.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          That material appears biological.

<b>                      SMITH

          Nothing good will come of this.

<b>                      WEST

          What makes you such an expert?

<b>                      SMITH

          Trust me, Major. Evil knows evil.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Let's find the bridge. Maybe we can
          get some answers.

They head off. HOLD on the dripping membrane.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
Maureen is at the main sensor console working an instrument panel.

Penny is hanging upside down in a harness overhead, using a laser
welder on a giant mass of exposed ceiling circuitry.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Try it now, Mom.

Maureen throws a switch. The panel lights up, then goes dead.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Damn.

<b>INT.-SHIP-WALKING
</b>
The boarding party stand at the end of the corridor. Don presses a
wall panel. The giant doors hiss open to REVEAL...

<b>INT.-MAIN BRIDGE
</b>
Immense. Empty. And battle torn. Sections of the controls have been
blown away. Blast scoring mars the walls.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          What the hell happened in here?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Some kind of fire fight. Look at this
          technology. I've seen some of this
          before. On the drawing boards.

Smith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a STORAGE ALCOVE.
Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours.

John and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Can you bring up the Captain's log?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          The data has degraded. I'm going try
          and gather any fragments I can. There
          isn't much, but ... here we go.

MAIN SCREEN-CLOSE. Fills with snow. Then a figure can be seen. It's
Jab. But his hair is grey.

<b>                      WEST

          Jeb.

<b>                      JEB

          The hyperspace tracker seems to be
          functioning...

          No sign of the Jupiter Two...

<b>                      JEB

          by two...

          (static)

          I'm not willing to give up. Don would
          keep looking for me.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          That's it. The rest of the data is
          totally corrupted.

IN THE ALCOVE, Smith frees a power pack from one of the robots. Slips
it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          This doesn't make sense. How could
          they launch a rescue mission for us
          when we've only been lost a day?

Judy stands by the life sciences panel.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          I've got something here.

A turning holograph appears over the console panel. A degraded image
of a trembling, viscous pouch. Tiny shapes move within.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          They brought it up from the planet's
          surface. It's seems to be some sort
          of egg sack.

Don notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Smith, step away from there.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Happy to oblige, Major. Although I
          don't think it's me you should be
          worrying about. But rather this.

In the corner of the ceiling, another membrane covered hole.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
Will is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's POV.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          I'm detecting motion. Behind you...

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP BRIDGE
</b>
A towering SHADOW shoots past the open doorway.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          After it. Move.

          (to the Robot)

          Bring Smith.

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR
</b>
Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering
plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor.

THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from
behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery.

Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to
a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside.

<b>INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB
</b>
A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          This explains where all the plants
          came from.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          Growth like this would take decades.

The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Don't move.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          I am sick of your terrorism. If you
          are going to kill me, be done with
          it. Otherwise I will insist you treat
          me with the respect and-

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          (like steel)

          I said don't move.

Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's
head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he
pulls from its hiding place a small creature.

About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf
color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales
of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
Will is watching through the Robot's eyes.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Neat.

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN
</b>
West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more
friendly blue. Judy approaches.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          Well, who do we have here?

As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like,
trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Easy there, little buddy. No one's
          going to hurt you.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          How do you know it won't hurt us?

Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small
beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          Looks like you've made a friend. You
          have a good bedside manner, Major.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I'm going to let that one go.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          How charming. Doctor Dolittle of
          outer space.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          Where do you think it came from?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          It's possible this is one of the
          creatures represented in the
          hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It
          must have been their ship attached to
          the other docking ring.

The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there,
burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          It looks like a child.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          If so, my dear Major, what do you
          suppose happened to its parents?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Let's get back to the bridge.

As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the
background. Ominous. Unseen.

CHAPTER 14: Giant Spiders!

</b>
Penny is still hanging overhead.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          I think I've got it.

The sensor console comes back to life, displays lighting, status
lights going green. Maureen stares at the monitor.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          That's strange.

SCREEN-CLOSE. Revealed in the sensor scan, the scallops pulse with
ambient heat. Penny lands beside her.

<b>                      PENNY

          Those scales are giving off heat.

John is at the Com.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I've tapped into the internal sensor
          array. Besides us, this ship is
          totally deserted.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          A ghost ship.

Don is sitting with the tiny creature. He pulls a ration pack from his
pocket. Turns it over in his hand.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          And the flavor of the day is ...
          banana/beef. Who thinks up these
          combinations?

The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip,
sucks a bit LOUDLY. Judy can't help but smile at him.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          MM. Good.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Major West, I highly recommend you
          never breed. That by the way is my
          medical opinion.

Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch. The creature
looks at it, emits a small BLIP, takes a tentative suck. Its eyes
widen in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Little thing was hungry.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Good Lord, who will - spare us the
          tyranny of the sentimental?

(OVER) a distant, high pitched WHINE.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Do you hear something?

Suddenly the creature begins to SCREAM, leaping on Smith's back,
clinging to his neck for dear life.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Get this infernal creature off me.

The WHINE is growing louder. it seems to be coming from above.

THE CEILING-CLOSE. There, in the corner, the membrane covering the
hole seems to be trembling.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          This can't be good.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          You have a remarkably keen sense
          of the obvious.

Maureen stands with Penny at the main sensor station.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          John, get the hell out of there.

ON SCREEN. The silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are
beginning to move, rising to stand now on spindraled legs.

<b>EXT.-PROBE SHIP
</b>
Heads and legs emerging, the disks reveal themselves to be armor
plated spiders. The monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and
push through, vanishing into the probe ship.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
(OVER) a THUD. The Jupiter Two shakes, as if struck.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          Give me an external view.

Penny works the console.

ON SCREEN. Spiders are leaping from the probe onto the Jupiter Two.

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE
</b>
The lizard monkey's SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A
shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling.

What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare. Nearly half the size of
a human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend.
A fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes.

Don draws his laser and FIRES, but the blast only reflects off the
metallic surface of its torso, forcing the creature to retract its
limbs and eyes, hiding within its protective shell.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Evacuate. Now!

The team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the
hole in the ceiling, landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards
our fleeing heros.

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP-TUNNELS
</b>
The boarding party race down the corridor. The spiders are bounding
after them, using walls, floor, and ceiling with equal facility.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
Will is madly working his keyboard, controlling the fleeing Robot.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          This joy stick is too slow. Activate
          holographic interface.

A holographic robot appears on the bridge. Will steps inside, the
image now moving with his body. He spins, facing backwards, firing.

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP
</b>
The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it
can retreat and FIRE simultaneously.

The Robot's plasma BLASTS have more effect than-the lasers, blowing
the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal.

But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor
ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades.

Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          They eat their wounded.

Our heroes race to a nexus, corridors leading off in all directions.
Spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Which way?

<b>INT. -JUPITER TWO
</b>
WILL-POV. A graphic map flashes within the holograph.

INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIdOR

<b>                      ROBOT

          of the corridor.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          The fire sensor.

Judy pulls her gun, FIRES, hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the
corridor. Blast doors SLAM, sealing out most of the spiders.

DON-CLOSE. Impressed.

BLAST DOORS-CLOSE. Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel.

Our group has made it to the door to the docking bay. They rush in,
the Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there.

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY
</b>
Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening.

The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the
spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away. More pour
through the now rending blast doors. There are just too many, rolling
towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Open, damn you.

<b>                      WEST

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Fools. I warned you not to come
          aboard this cursed craft. You've

Judy throws him, hard, into the wall.

          Shut up.

<b>                      WEST

The first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO

Maureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines. Will is
within the holograph, fighting off the spiders.

<b>                      WILL

          Charge.

<b>INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY

The Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling.

The airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside.

<b>                      JOHN

          Will, get the Robot in here.

The Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs
shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to SHORT.

spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by.

<b>                      WILL

A spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic
body, bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK
</b>
<b>                      JOHN

          Seal it. Now!

Don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the

          I'll look after her. She needs me.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          ...The moment you misplace her, or
          forget to feed her, we leave her on
          this planet where she can live in the
          wild. I'm not kidding Penny.

And with that Judy EXITS. Penny sits, stroking the tiny creature.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          We're both a long way from home,
          aren't we little one?

The creature makes a tiny BLIP.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          That's what we'll call you. Blip.

Blip reaches out, touches a green ribbon around Penny's wrist.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          You like that?

Penny takes the ribbon off, ties it around Blip's wrist. Blip looks
up, eyes glowing. Penny caresses the tiny creature's cheek.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

The creature reaches up, touches Penny's cheek. Her tiny tongue trying
to imitate Penny's words of comfort.

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
Judy stands, just out of sight, watching her sister, smiling.

CHAPTER 16: Alien World
<b>-----------------------
</b>

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-MED LAB
</b>
Don shoves an indignant Smith into the room, adjusts a newly installed
security panel in the wall.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Remove that lock this instant. I
          shall not be caged like some animal

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          (lethal)

          I gave my word I'd let you live. I
          never said for how long.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          These quarters will be fine.

Smith stares at him a beat.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Tell me, Major West. Are you really
          confident in Robinson's ability to
          guide us? If I were set free, I would
          support your right to command. With
          minimal force, we could take this
          ship and assure this mission
          continues under your leadership.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          ...My God Smith, you're right. How
          could I have been so blind? I'll just
          run and get you a gun so we can
          hijack the ship. Okay?

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak
          mind.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I'm hiding the pain. Really.

And with that West leaves.

Smith tries the door. Locked. Then, from one cuff of his field suit,
be removes the control belt he stole from the probe ship.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          I assure you, Major West. Your pain
          has just begun.

Smith moves about the room, lifting small bits of metal, creating an
impromptu set of tools with which to alter the control bolt.

PAN DOWN. HOLD on SMITH'S BACK. Beneath the rend in his suit, the tiny
tear in his flesh is now covered with tiny, alien scales.

<b>INT. -BRIDGE-NIGHT
</b>
Judy sits in one of the command chairs over a the remains of a meal,
sipping water, staring out into the alien night.

<b>                      WEST (OVER)
</b>
          Star light, star bright...

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          A million strange stars and only one
          wish. I wish we were home.

Don comes and sits in the co-pilot's chair beside her.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          I never thought a sky could look so
          alien. ...We really are lost.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          When the first sailors circled the
          globe and saw a brand new sky, they
          thought they had sailed off the edge
          of the earth. But they were really
          just around the corner.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          (smiles)

          We just billow our sails and let the
          wind blow us home, Is that it Major?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          So those sailors found familiar
          shapes in the stars to make the skies
          more friendly, to help them find
          their way.

Don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen. MONITOR-CLOSE. It shows
the star-field above. He lifts a light-tipped stylus.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          That's how constellations were born.

Don begins to draw on the screen, connecting the stars like dots in a
children's book. Slowly, a familiar porcine face takes form.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Porky the wise and mighty Pig.

Judy LAUGHS. She takes the stylus. Begins to draw.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          The great bucktoothed Bunny... Bugs.

Don smiles. Judy can't help but smile back. Their faces are close.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          So, my quarters or yours?

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          Excuse me?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          We are the only single man and woman
          of consenting age in the galaxy. How
          much more of a set up do you need?

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          So you figure just dispense with the
          pleasantries, get down to business?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          You have a way with words, Doctor.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          (provocative)

          Right here? On this console?

Don moves his face to hers, only a breath apart.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Here would be fine.

Judy smiles sweetly.

DON-CLOSE. Lips parting. Suddenly water begins to pour down over his
head. His eyes open wide. Judy holds her empty glass in hand.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          Next time, fly slower.

She rises, walks off, leaving Don mopping his brow.

<b>INT.-JOHN & MAUREEN'S QUARTERS
</b>
Maureen sits on the edge of her bed brushing her hair as John
activates the automated security systems.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          What was I thinking, bringing us all
          out here into space?

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          The world needed saving. You were the
          right man for the job.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          But solving the world's problems
          doesn't leave much time for the
          people you love, does it?

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          Did you get any time with Will?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Now he's decided he can rebuild the
          robot. Wants to show me his designs.
          I've got too much to do-

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          Funny creatures, men. You try so hard
          not to be your fathers, end up making
          the same mistakes. Will adores you.
          He needs your attention.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          We can't get off this planet much
          less back on course. I don't have
          time to...

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          John, just listen to him. it doesn't
          matter what he's saying. Just listen.
          Sometimes, at least in the eyes of
          their fathers, little boys have to
          come first.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          As soon as we get back into space,
          we're going to spend some real time
          together. I promise.

Maureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          What?

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          It's nice to have our family under
          one roof. Even if we had to go half
          way across the galaxy to manage it.

John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked
orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          How would you feel about a little
          late night tutorial, Professor?

John moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          Mm. That's new. What are you doing?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Going for extra credit.

<b>EXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT
</b>
The ship sits on the alien landscape.

<b>                      MAUREEN (OVER)

          Good night John.

<b>                      JOHN (OVER)

CHAPTER 17: The Core
<b>--------------------
</b>

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING
</b>
Will comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the
morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen.

WILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Oh man.

<b>REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
A giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship.
Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees.

<b>INT.-BRIEFING ROOM
</b>
The crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          What are those rumblings? They've
          been happening all morning.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          How can half the landscape have grown
          up overnight?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Okay, let's get settled. Maureen?

MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates
that make up this world appear mismatched.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          It's impossible. But this planet's
          geothermic plates don't match up.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I was afraid of this.

Al1 eyes turn to John.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I think these tremors are the result
          of opening and closing doorways.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Doorways to where?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          The future.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Perhaps the Professor was hit on the
          head when we landed.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Remember the portal that lead us to
          the probe ship? What if we crossed a
          into a time years after Earth sent a
          rescue mission.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          You're not serious? Time travel is
          impossible.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          No it's not. It's just improbable.
          Like hyperdrive was a hundred years
          ago. Nothing's really impossible.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          This world could be riddled with
          doorways to the future.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          So if we walk into that forest
          outside, we're really just walking
          into this crater years from now.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          Geological plates from different
          times wouldn't fit together. That
          would explain the tectonic mismatch.
          But doorways in time, John?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          If these portals are opening and
          closing, part of some cascading,
          natural phenomenon, they could be
          tearing this planet apart

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          These portals are exactly what I
          predicted my time machine would do.
          What if the doorways aren't natural?
          A machine that bends space, like our
          hyperdrive, could be modified to bend
          time as well. What if someone on this
          world has built a device?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Son, I appreciate your input but now
          isn't the time for flights of fancy.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          You never listen to me. Not ever.

And with that Will storms out. John stares after him a beat, sorely
wanting to follow. (OVER) another RUMBLE.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          There's no telling how long before
          this planet breaks up entirely.

          (rising).

          Don and I are going to locate the
          radioactive material for the core.
          Get the ship ready to go. We may have
          very little time.

<b>INT. -BRIDGE
</b>
John, suited up, heads for the open front hatch when he spots Will
sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering with his deck.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Aren't you coming out to say goodbye?

Will just shakes his head.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          You're always leaving. What if...

Will looks away, finally giving voice to his worst fear.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          What if one time you don't come
          home...

John stares at his son, unsure what to say, the boy's anguish so deep
and apparent. He reaches into his shirt, takes off his dog tags.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Whenever your grandfather went away
          on a mission, held leave these with
          me. For safe keeping. And when he got
          home I d always be waiting to give
          them back.

He lifts the chain and places it around the boy's neck.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I'm coming back Will. I promise.

Will is silent. John touches the boy's hair, then walks out. A beat.
Will looks up after his father, fingering the dog tags.

<b>EXT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
The Robinsons, all except Will, stand-gathered around the front of the
ship. Don has a small tracking device in his hand.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I've got a fix on the radioactive
          material. It's through the portal.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          We'll just have to hope the doorways
          remain stable.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          These crater walls are disabling the
          com-links. You won't be able to
          communicate with the ship.

(OVER) the ground shakes again.

                      Maureen

          Come home to me, Professor.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I love you, wife.

John kisses her. Don looks at Judy.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          I'm going to regret saying this, But
          try to get back in one piece.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          This is kind of a kiss for luck
          occasion, wouldn't you agree, Doc?

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          See. I'm regretting it already.

          (coy)

          Kisses have to be earned. Say
          goodbye, Blip.

Blip reaches up and touches John's face. Then her CHIRPS form a rough
approximation of the words Penny taught her.

<b>                      BLIP
</b>
          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          You take care of her, Penny.

          (kisses her head)

          Take care of you too, baby.

Then the two men bead off, towards the portal and forest beyond.

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
Smith stares out the cabin window. PUSH IN as

<b>INT.-SMITH'S CELL
</b>
<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Yes, enjoy your moments of trite
          familial bonding.

He turns, heads back to his table, transformed now, into a makeshift
lab, the stolen control bolt in mid-modification.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Because they will be your last.

<b>INT.-WILL'S CABIN
</b>
The beginnings of Will's home-made robot sits on the table. WILL is in
the f.g. riffling his PERSONAL CARGO container.

Penny ENTERS, an assortment of small electronic devices, hairclips,
and other metal and electronic objects. Dumps them on the table.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          That's everything even close to
          nonessential. Even my bellybutton
          ring.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Thanks, Pen.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          You want to come on a land survey?

But Will just shakes his head, sulky.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Look, what does dad know? Maybe
          someone did build a time machine.

She ruffles his hair. Disappears. Will activates a CPU speaker.

<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          Robot is on line.

(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          It sounds like old morse code.


Chapter 18: Danger Will!
<b>------------------------
</b>

<b>INT.-CORRIDOR
</b>
Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will
follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison.

Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table,
hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside.

Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          (sounding out the code)

          Danger.

<b>INT.-SMITH'S CELL
</b>
The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          You said someone is in danger.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          We all are. You are wise to arm
          yourself.

Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          This gun is set to fire for me only
          so don't try anything funny.

Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going
instead to the window and opening the blast shield.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          William, you misjudge me. I only want
          to help you.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Help us? You tried to kill us all.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          But now our fates are intertwined. if
          your father and that idiot West fail,
          I will have no chance of getting
          home. It is in my best interests they
          succeed. And I always follow my best
          interests.

Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          What monsters roam these alien wilds?
          Fools. To set off blindly across this
          savage land. Much as I hate to admit
          it, it will be harder to manage
          without them.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          What are you talking about? They'll
          be back. They'll be okay.

Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Someone should go after them.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A
          clever one, certainly, but a child
          nonetheless. This planet is likely
          full of predators. Even if you found
          them, what if they're hurt, ravaged,
          dying, what good could you do?

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          But you're a doctor.

Smith turns away, hiding his smile.

Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater
wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds.

<b>                      JUDY

          It's impossible.

<b>                      MAUREEN

          Not really. Geologists have
          speculated that Dimondium might be
          naturally occurring in many older
          worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of
          rejuvenating itself.

<b>                      JUDY

          This one is ten times more powerful

          enough here to save Earth.

Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples,
talking into her video recorder.

</b>
          After much deliberation, the Space
          Captive has decided to accept her new
          role as member of the crew. The
          Robinsons, after all, can  obviously
          use her help...

Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          (flaring)

          Now look what you've done. Stop
          hanging all over me.

Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the
edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick
brush..

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn.

Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten.


CHAPTER 19: A Different Future
<b>------------------------------
</b>

<b>EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY
</b>
Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation
tracker in his hand.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon.

Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves
moving in the wind like an azure sea.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Wow, that's Mom's favorite color.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          How droll.

(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the
distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them,
flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Run, child, run.

Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the
rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the
distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes.

SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing
beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Will? Will?

No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Wow!

The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the
flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          William, wait!

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          See, over here I'm in the future.

(steps back towards Smith)

          Here I'm in the past. Don't worry.
          If my theories are correct, these
          doorways should remain stable, for
          a while anyway.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          I can barely contain my glee. Why
          aren't you aging like the plants?

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          That's just an effect of the portals
          forming. Once they stabilize you can
          cross from one time to another
          just like stepping between two
          rooms.

          (off his tracker)

          Dad's signal is this way. Come on,
          Doctor Smith.

Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold.

SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing
crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared.
Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush.

Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush,
revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens.

<b>                      WILL (OVER)
</b>
          What did you find?

Will has returned.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Come, come, son, no time for
          distractions. Let's move on.

Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw.

PAN DOWN. Headstones. Each bears a marking, the names still legible.
Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson.

<b>EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY-PRES
</b>
John and Don emerge from the brush. They have come to one of the
crater walls. John looks from the rock face to his tracker.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Damn.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Damn? Damn is not good.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          The radiation signature we've been
          tracking. it's a  ghost. A
          reflection from the Jupiter Two
          bouncing off the ore in these walls.
          There's no core material here.

(OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time
portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the
crater aging and crumbling in it's wake.

John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees,
roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker,
more deserted future.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          The ship's back that way. we have to
          go through.

<b>EXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT
</b>
Penny is pushing through the forest.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Blip? I'm sorry. Blip?

She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the
ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip
is another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker,
the sky red. Blip steps through the portal.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Blip, wait.

Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall
trees beyond. A beat. Then she steps through, following.

<b>EXT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE
</b>
Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs
and caverns cut into the crater wall.

BLIP is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down,
CHIRPING and BLIPPING madly.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Blip, you can't run off like that.

(closing on the stone)

          What the-?

THE STONE-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant
rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship.

HIEROGLYPH ONE-CLOSE. A mighty battle in space is depicted.

<b>                      PENNY (OVER)
</b>
          Some kind of fight, in space. It
          almost looks like the probe ship
          Major West blew up.

HIEROGLYPH TWO-CLOSE. A fiery star falls to the planet's surface.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          That could be the Jupiter Two crash
          landing.

HIEROGLYPH THREE-CLOSE. Here a dark haired beauty holds a single
lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's.

Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves.

SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms
dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard
monkeys, two large, two smaller.

Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully
grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's
wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon.

BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          Blip, no!

Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The
beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't
resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness.

Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her
wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical.

The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw
reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's
cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.

<b>                      GIANT BLIP
</b>
          Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

Penny stares up in stunned wonder.

<b>EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE
</b>
Don and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more
desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.


<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          We should be able to see the ship.

Something catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches
down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand.

METAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Could these be from the probe?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Corroded. This metal is decades old.

Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          It's not possible.

WRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          What kind of nightmare is this?
          Where the hell are we?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          No, Major, when the hell are we?

Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying.
John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a
rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful
electrical blast, falling hard. Still.

<b>REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and
apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot.

<b>EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE
</b>
Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given
way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          I feel like we got turned around.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Just follow your father's signal,
          young William.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Oh shit.

<b>                      SMITH

          A boy of your intelligence shouldn't
          swear.

          Look.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Oh. Shit, indeed.

REVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of
the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open
to the sun.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE

Or what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers
Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is
slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him.

<b>                      VOICE (OVER)
</b>
          Well, well. All things really do
          come to he who waits.

A FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow.

<b>                      JOHN

          What is this place?

<b>                      FIGURE

          You've come home.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          This can't be...

But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          What have you done to the ship.
          ...Where's my family?

<b>                      FIGURE

          Your family is dead. Dead and in the
          ground.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          No!

<b>                      FIGURE
</b>
          What fickle consort in memory. Time
          dims certain images while others
          shine clear and bright as yesterday.

The figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond
hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar.

<b>                      FIGURE

          I'll never forget that morning.
          Twenty years ago. What was it you
          said? I'll be back. I promise. But I
          knew better. You never came home.

The figure walks to one of the burned out panels.

<b>                      FIGURE
</b>
          Without you, your family never had a
          chance. A few spidersv survived the
          destruction of the probe ship. They
          reached the planet and attacked. I
          can still hear the women scream.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Who are you?

The figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then
he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but
familiar. John's father's dog tags.

<b>                      FIGURE

The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny.

<b>                      MAUREEN

          Penny? Baby, are you alright?

Penny rises, steps forward, carrying Blip. The other beasts hang back,
their faces genuflecting, almost reverential.

War torn and pirated. A pit of molten lava bursts through the floor
above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by
the pulsing field of the hyper-drive. Tendrils of fire strain towards
the bubble. As they EXPLODE into the silver liquid, images form within
the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone.

A tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the
bubble. At the end of the track a crow's-nest of COMPUTERS SHOOTS a
single laser down into the center of the bubble.

<b>                      WEST

<b>                      JOHN

          I think we crossed into our own

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Look father, what my flights of
          fancy have wrought. I used your
          hypergate to build my time machine.

Will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Over the years I have struggled in
          vain to harness the awesome power of
          time. All my experiments at creating
          a stable doorway have been futile.
          Until now. Today you will witness my
          ultimate triumph.

Will hits a button. A generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of
core material incrementally descending into the console.

<b>                      WEST

          The core material. if we could get
          that back to our Jupiter Two...

<b>                      JOHN

          The doorways in time that led us
          here must be a side effect of his

          running into the ocean....

<b>                      OLDER WILL

          Once this core material in fully

          through time and space as well.
          Today, I will change history.

Will turns a switch on the control console. (OVER) More TREMORS. The
laser beam's intensity grown, and in the corridor cut by the beam into
the bubble images begins to stabilize. Images of Earth.

<b>                      OLDER WILL

</b>
          Will, I'm your father. You've got to
          listen to me-.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Let me tell you about my father. My
          father was a walking ghost. Never
          there when I needed him. He dragged
          his family into deep dark space and
          lost them there. My father is not
          coming to the rescue.

CHAPTER 20: Spiders Sting
<b>-------------------------
</b>

EXT.-ALIEN PLAnet-EVENING-FUTURE

Will and Smith are closing on the battered ship. Smith puts his hand
on the boy's arm, holding him back.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          We've got to go inside.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Slow down, now. We can't know what
          waits inside that ravaged craft. But
          we can be confidant it is nothing
          good. And I for one am frightened.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          But Dad's in there.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Will, listen to me. I have crossed
          this world with you, found your
          father as promised. But I can't let
          you go in there unarmed.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          But I've got a gun.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          If we go forward, the barer of that
          weapon must be ready to kill. Murder
          is a skill, one which I have
          developed and, luckily dear boy, you
          have not. Look inside your heart,
          Will. Are you truly capable of
          taking a life? If not, then I ask
          you now, put your faith in me. Give
          me your trust. Give me that gun.

Will stares him. Pulls free the pistol. Thumbs the lock pad.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Enable gun for all users.


<b>                      GUN
</b>
          Voiceprint confirmed.

Will hands Smith the gun.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Finally.

Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          A brief lesson in survival on this
          world or any other. Never trust
          anyone. Remember it into your old
          age, should you have one.

          (shoving him forward)

          Now move!

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE
</b>
John stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the
control panel and the descending core material.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          We can go back across the portals to
          the past, to the functioning Jupiter
          Two, where your mother and sisters
          are still alive. We can use this
          core material to escape together.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          And then what? All of us lost in
          space. Don't you see? I can do what
          you never could. I can save us all.

Don has edged his way to the descending core material.

<b>                      SMITH (OVER)
</b>
          I'm afraid not.

          Through the doorway comes young
          Will, Smith walking behind him, hand
          on his shoulder, gun to his head.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Never fear. Smith is here.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Will, I. . .

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Don't move, Professor Robinson or
          this rather peculiar family reunion
          will be tragically brief.

          (off Don)

          I'll ask you to step away from that
          console, Major.

Don stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John.
Smith approaches the Robot.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Well, well, some of us just don't
          know when to stay dead.

Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          I borrowed this from the probe ship
          in hopes of taking over the helm
          once we were in flight. But I seem
          to have found a better use instead.

Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up,
then fall limp. Docile.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Let's try this dance again. You are
          the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do
          get it right this time.

Smith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Robot, enable electric disrupters.

The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Now that's a good gargantuan.

Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Say goodbye to your past. You're
          future lies with me. I'm going home
          in your place.

Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring
at the time machine, eyes wide with awe.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          You did it. Just like I imagined.
          Re-routed the hypercore. But the
          natural power source, the delivery
          system. I never thought of those.

Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger
self. Touches his hair.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          You will. The future is never what
          it looks like when you're ten.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          Heartwarming. Nauseatingly
          sentimental but heartwarming.

Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          We certainly could have aged better,
          I must say Now, show me how your
          little time machine works.

But Will just smiles.

<b>                      SMITH
</b>
          An odd moment for mirth, don't you
          think? What are you grinning at?

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Look around you, Doctor. At this
          hostile world. Do you really think a
          boy could have survived all alone?

SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be
moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar.

<b>                      VOICE (OVER)
</b>
          Never fear, Smith is here.

The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and
legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me
          again after all these years.

Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled
legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          The spider's sting had some
          unexpected side effects.

Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          But my unique gifts gave me an
          advantage in this quarrelsome world.

Spider Smith reaches out and caresses Will's cheek. Turns  to John.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          After the women were savaged, I
          became the father Will never had.

He grabs Smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette,
engaging in a bizarre dance with himself.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          (bending him)

          But you, Doctor. Your crude ambition
          fills me with self-loathing.

          (twisting him)

          You see I have looked within me and
          what I see is you.

With that Spider Smith lifts Smith over his head and hurls him like
torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          I never liked me, anyway.

Spider Smith turns to face the Robot.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Kill them all.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          No.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          But my dear boy, once the doorway in
          time stabilizes, this planet is
          going to come apart at the seams.

Smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a
twenties starlet.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          I am willing to perish here on this
          world for the sake of your most
          noble mission. But your selfish
          father will only try to stop you.

His head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces WILL.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Once your mission is complete, none
          of this will have happened anyway.
          So why not just dispose of them?

But Will's gaze is impassive. Spider Smith actually SIGHS.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Very well. Robot, take them inside
          the ship and keep them there. If
          they move, then kill them.

<b>ECT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE
</b>
Maureen and Judy are examining the heiroglyph stone. The ground
shakes. Birds SCREAM. (OVER) RUMBLING.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          We've got to get to the ship. Penny?

She turns. The clearing is empty. No Blips. No Penny. Blip runs cut
before them, grabs Maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          Where is she, girl?

In Blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from Penny's wrists. Blip
waves them in the air, then races off. A beat. The women follow.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE
</b>
The pulse laser is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in
the bubble stabilizing. The TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

<b>PAN DOWN
</b>
Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as the Robot shepherds the
crew towards the body of the ship.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Well, it would seem the time is upon
          us. Off we go, William.

Spider Smith starts climbing the gantry, truly like a spider, up
towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble.

Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning
to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above.

JOHN-POV. Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back.
It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          (shouting)

          Will, it's a trick. Smith's carrying
          an egg sack. If he's willing to stay
          on this world and die, why is he
          about to spawn? He's going through
          the portal himself.

The Robot FIRES a charge between its claws.

<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          Proceed to the ship or be destroyed.

<b>ON THE RISING CONTROL PLATFORM.
</b>
OLDER WILL-CLOSE. Frowns.

Suddenly, Smith's head drops INTO FRAME. The creature is hanging
upside-down. He smiles.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Hurry, boy. Time waits for no man.

<b>EXT.-GANTRY SYSTEM-WIDE SHOT
</b>
The platform bearing Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins
moving out across the bridge towards the crows-nest.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FUTURE
</b>
Spider Smith drops into place beside Older Will as the control
platform comes to a stop on the crow's-nest.

The core cylinder continues sinking into the console. Smith looks out
over the platform. Beneath them, imagine of infinity flicker.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          It's almost time. I really am a
          word-smith.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Once the core cylinder is fully
          injected, the planet will begin to
          come apart and the time doorway will
          stabilize. Then I jump in.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          A leap of faith. How fitting.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. In the circle made by the laser, the images are not
yet stable, but discernable. Earth the day before the launch.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Tell me again, old monster, how did
          the girls die?

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          We've been over this before, son.
          The spiders attacked the ship

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          In all the years since, the spiders
          have never re-surfaced. Why?

Smith stares at him. Then he smiles. A horrible sight.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Let's forget the past.

Will turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          What are you doing?

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Focusing the aperture. Remember, the
          energy around the portal will rip a
          man to pieces.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Isn't the doorway too small?

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Not for me.

          (a beat)

          But then I'm not going, am I? The
          spiders didn't kill the girls. It
          was you. I just never let myself see
          it. You kept me alive because you
          needed me. Because I could build
          this for you. You killed my family.
          Destroyed this world. And I helped.
          You became mad as the spiders.
          ...And I became you.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Poor, poor boy. Did you really think
          I would let you go home? Let all
          that I have become vanish? Look at
          me. I am no mere man. I am a God.

Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Your father was right. Within me
          roil the growing needs of a master
          race. We WILL descend upon helpless
          Earth. An entire planet to rule.

His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth,
bearing venomous fangs.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          An entire planet on which to feed.

<b>INT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE
</b>
John and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER)
the TREMORS are increasing in frequency.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I'll run, draw his fire. You may
          have time to get away with Will.

<b>                      ROBOT (OVER)
</b>
          Halt or Robot will destroy.

The men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Do you remember what I taught you. A
          long time ago. About friendship?

<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          Friendship means acting with your
          heart not your head.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          That's why I rebuilt you. Because I
          wanted us to be friends.

<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          Logic error. Friendship does not
          compute.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Forget logic. Act with your heart.

<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          Robot has no heart. Robot is powered
          by a fusion pulse generator

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Every living thing has a heart.

The Robot stares at him a beat.

<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          Any attempts to override command
          protocols may result in fused
          processors in my neural net.

The floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Please, Robot, if you don't let us
          go, we're all going to die. I'm
          asking you now, will you help us?
          Will you be my friend?

The Robot stands still a beat. Then he reaches towards Smith's control
bolt attached firmly on his CPU.

<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          Robot attempting to deactivate

          overloadattempting to escape-kill
          them, kill them...

The Robot's claws lift into attack position, an electrical charge
building with dangerous intensity. He is about to fire.

At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a
piece of the ceiling. He rips off the control bolt.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          You did it.

<b>                      ROBOT

          Robot will save ... I will save Will
          Robinson. I will save my friend.


CHAPTER 21: Time to Die!
<b>------------------------
</b>

<b>EXT.-FOREST-DAY-PRESENT
</b>
Penny and Maureen chase a frantic Blip through the portal back into
the daylight of the present. Here, too, the world RUMBLES.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          (shouting )

          Penny? Penny?

Penny stands in front of the Jupiter Two, beckoning them urgently.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          Where did you go?

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          I came through the forest. I had a
          promise I had to keep.

Before Maureen can respond the ground RUMBLES, begins crumbling.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          Inside. Fast.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE
</b>
Don, John, Will and the Robot stand at the open hatch. Outside, the
ground RUMBLES.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          You've got find your way back to the
          ship. The portals may still be
          stable. I'll try to meet you there.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          What do you mean?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I'm going to get that core material.
          It's our only chance to escape.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I'll stay. The family needs their
          father

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          The crew needs their pilot. No
          matter what happens, when the planet
          starts to break up you take off.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Without the core we'll never have
          enough power to make orbit.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          You've got to try. Promise me, Don.

A beat. Then Don extends his hand.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Good luck. Commander.

Just then Will and the Robot arrive.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Will. Son. I want you to know-

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          (fighting tears)

          You'll tell me when you get back to
          the ship. Now there just isn't time.

John bites back a bittersweet smile. (OVER) another RUMBLING.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I could use a weapon.

The Robot extends his claw. A panel opens on his arm and he tears out
a hand-made component. A conduit made from Will's golden first prize
medals, joined together to make a jagged star.

<b>                      ROBOT
</b>
          Professor, I have a plan.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FuTURE

Spider Smith has Will against the rail.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Time to die, son.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          I'm not your son.

And with that Will SMASHES Spider Smith in the face with two closed
lists. Smith recoils, lifts the boy aver his head.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Goodbye.

Smith hurls Will over the rail towards the time pool below.

The creature walks to the end of the arm, stares at the forming
aperture into the past below him.

PORTAL-CLOSE. Images of the day before the mission launch swirl in the
laser-generated opening, growing ever more stable.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Will is hanging over the time bubble, unconscious and unseen, dangling
from the gantry by a flashing chain around his neck.


CHAPTER 22: Time Travel
<b>-----------------------
</b>

<b>EXT:-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE
</b>
Don and the Robot, Will riding his back, navigate the terrain
alongside the ravaged hull of the Jupiter Two.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Look.

On the ground, crumpled in a heap, is Smith. Don checks his pulse.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          (disappointed)

          Damn. He's still breathing.

(OVER) the rushing WIND. RUMBLING. A portal opens before them to a far
younger world. Then another portal, to a world far older. A third
portal RIPS across the sky overhead.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          The time machine must be near full
          power. The portals are collapsing.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Which one leads us home?

More portals are opening around them, others winking shut.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          There.

Through a new rip in time, the intact Jupiter Two can be seen in
relief of the battered future craft. The ground beneath their feet is
beginning to give way.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          We can't just leave him here.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Sure we can.

          (off WILL's stare)

          Damn it.

          (slapping the Doctor)

          Smith. Wake up. Smith.

<b>                      SMITH

          Oh, the pain, the pain.

<b>                      ROBOT

          Danger. Will Robinson. Danger.

The PORTAL is beginning to shimmer. The ground starts to fall away.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Jump!

Don hurls Smith through, Will, the Robot and West darting across the
threshold just as the portal winks closed.

<b>EXT. -FOREST- PRESENT
</b>
The trees are bursting into flames an Will, Don, the Robot and Smith
emerge from the woods. Race forwards towards...

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-PRESENT

The women are powering up the ship. The men are visible through the
windscreen. Outside, the ground in beginning to crumble.

<b>                      PENNY

          Mom, the forest.

Penny opens the air lock. Maureen holds close her son. Steps back.

</b>
          Where's John?

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          The portal closed behind us. It was
          his only way back.

MEE GROUND-CLOSE. A geyser of fire BLOWS into the air.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          We've got to try and lift off.

<b>                      MAUREEN

          (off Don's expression)

          I'm going to save as many lives as I
          can, Major. Now strap in.

INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFoRm-FUTURE

(OVER) TREMORS. More lava is rushing up towards the mercury, the walls
themselves beginning to crack.

SMITH opens a gate at the end of the crow's-nest and a gang plank
unfolds above the doorway in time.

<b>                      JOHN (OVER)
</b>
          Not so fast.

<b>WIDER
</b>
John stands on the platform behind Smith, fighting star in hand,
slashes for his face. Smith moves fast, knocking the star to the
gantry bridge with his arm. John leaps on Smith, using his fists.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          You sabotaged our mission.

          (hook)

          You killed my family

          (jab)

          You stole my son. It's payback time.

Smith's head moves from each impact, but the punches have no effect.
It smiles. Grabs John and hurls him across the platform.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          Spare me the fury of the righteous.

The monster leans down over John. Opens its jaw.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          I think there's time for a snack
          before my trip.

John's hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star. At the last
moment John grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk, slashes Smith
across the face, silver-red blood pouring down his cheek.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          (sarcastic)

          Oh, the pain. The pain.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          You ain't seen nothing yet.

John feints towards Smith's head and then slashes low, cutting the
viscous membrane of the monster's egg pouch.

SPIDER SMITH-CLOSE. Surprised.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Remember the probe ship? These
          monsters eat their wounded.


SMITH'S EGG SACK-CLOSE. Scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of
the sack, rushing up towards Smith's face, tiny jaws chomping.

<b>                      SPIDER SMITH
</b>
          No. Stop. No!

Spider Smith tumbles backwards, falling against the rail on the side
of the platform. John rises and rushes him, SHOULDER-SLAMMING him,
sending Smith hurling over towards the bubble below.

Spider Smith hits the bubble, missing the doorway formed by the red
laser and is swept up by the tides of time.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Take all the time you want to die.


Spider Smith SCREAMS as he disappears and reappears in the various
half-formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether.

John turns. The core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the
main console. only seconds before it's too late to retrieve it.

<b>EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT
</b>
The landscape is a sudden inferno.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT

Don is at the Com. Maureen strapped into the co-pilot's chair.

<b>                      MAUREEN

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

<b>                      MAUREEN

          Goodbye, my love.

CHAPTER 23: Escape Velocity
<b>---------------------------
</b>

The ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Engaging primary thrusters. Now!

<b>EXT. -JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT
</b>
The power drive begins to glow, diodes spinning. The landing struts
retract. The Jupiter Two begins to rise.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-INSERTION ARM-FUTURE
</b>
CONTROL CONSOLE-CLOSE. The core material in sinking fast. John moves
towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye.

GANTRY-CLOSE. Wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal
reflecting the setting sunlight. John's father's dog tags.

John rushes to the rail. There, still unconscious and hanging by the
dog-tag chain is Older Will.

CHAIN-CLOSE. The metal links are pulling apart. Will is seconds away
from falling into the pool.

JOHN-POV. The cylinder has completely sunken into the machine. It's
Will or the core material. No time for both.

John stands a beat, immobile. Then he drops to his knees, reaching
down as the chain breaks, grabbing Will's wrist at the last second.

The dog tags tumble into the pool below as John hoists Older Will up
onto the safety of the gangplank.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Come on, son. Wake up.

Will is still. Then, finally, his eyes open.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Dad?

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I thought I lost you.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          The core.

Will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control
panel, the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the
cylinder's radioactive power. The world begins to EXPLODE.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          You could have taken the core and
          left before it was too late. You
          saved me instead.

John stares at him.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          There wasn't any choice. I couldn't
          let you fall.You're my boy.


THE LASER-CLOSE. Reaches full power. The image in the time pool
stabilizes, becoming clear.

TIME POOL-CLOSE. Mission Control the day before the launch.

Father and Son stare into the past, eyes filled with wonder.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Look. They made it.

PAN UP. Through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space,
the Jupiter Two is rising into the flame ravaged sky.

<b>INT.JUPITER TWO-PRESENT
</b>
The ship is shaking madly.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          We're not getting any altitude.

<b>EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT
</b>
The fire GEYSERS are legion, giant chunks of the planet's surface now
falling away beneath them. A huge spew of flame rages from the
fire-pocked surface, hitting the bull of the tiny craft.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT
</b>
Judy is at navigation, frantically enhance the stabilizers.

<b>                      JUDY
</b>
          I'm reading a power build up.
          Markers in the red-

Suddenly the panel EXPLODES, sending Judy flying across the bridge.
Penny races to her sister. Kneels. Judy's eyes are wide, still.

<b>                      PENNY
</b>
          She's dead.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT
</b>
The ground is breaking, falling into an endless fiery abyss below.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Not enough power to make orbit.

<b>EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRES ENT
</b>
Another firestorm. A flame geyser hits the ship. Then another.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-PRESENT
</b>
Control panels all around the ship begin to SLOW. The main screen is
hit by a flying chunk of rock. The giant glass begins to crack.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          (to Maureen)

          I'm sorry.

The windshield EXPLODES, sucking them both out into space.

<b>EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY-PRESENT
</b>
The ship is hit by another fire geyser. The Jupiter Two EXPLODES.

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE
</b>
John and Will kneel on the crow's nest as the Jupiter Two dodges the
fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull. The ship is struck
once, again, finally EXPLODING in a ROARING ball of fire.

JOHN-CLOSE. A man who has lost everything he ever loved.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I couldn't save them.

Will stares at his father and beyond him. There, in the time doorway,
a young Will walks towards the entrance to Mission Control in the
morning sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future.

<b>                      OLDER WILL (OVER)
</b>
          So many years ago and I can still
          feel it. Our sun. Our Earth. It's
          all I've thought about. Going home.

Will reaches forward and touches the control console. The images in
the laser generated doorway begin to change.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          A long time ago, you told a small
          boy that one day he'd understand how
          precious he was, how much his father
          loved him. Today is that day.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. Instead of Earth we now see this planet's surface,
the Jupiter Two rising as it did just moments ago.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          All I could see was your need to go
          forward at any cost. What you never
          showed me was your love. I lost
          that. Robbed by time. I could never
          see how much you cared. Until now.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire
geysers, then EXPLODING all over again. Will enters some commands.

TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The image in the portal begins to run backwards,
the Jupiter Two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past
diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          Father, take my hand.

<b>INT.-CUPITER TWO
</b>
We are back in the ship just before take off. DON mans the Cam.
Maureen straps herself into the co-pilot's chair.

<b>                      MAUREEN

          I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

Maureen stares a beat out the window.

<b>                      MAUREEN

          Goodbye my love.

<b>                      PENNY

          Look.

The roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like
water. There, standing above them, John and Older WILL.

<b>2NT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-CROW'S NEST-FUTURE
</b>
The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated
doorway. Older WILL looks to his father.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          DON'T make me wait another lifetime
          to know how you feel.

And with that he pushes John over the edge, the Professor falling down
through space and into the bubble and the doorway below.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles
her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the
watery hull.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Come with us.

But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the
world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g.

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          I can't. There was only enough power
          for one person, one trip, remember?

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          Will?

<b>                      OLDER WILL
</b>
          It's good to see you again, Mom.
          It's good to see you alive.

          (fading)

          Sorry about all the monkey business.

Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands
almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          He sacrificed everything for his
          family.

<b>                      MAUREEN
</b>
          (fighting tears)

          He had a good example.

Maureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          Dad?

A beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags.

<b>                      WILL
</b>
          I'm glad you came back.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I just want you to know I love you
          son. I love you very much.

John takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close.
(OVER) more RUMBLING as the ground continues to give way.

<b>                      WEST (OVER)

          The planet is breaking up around us.

John moves fast to the Com.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Nice of you to drop in.

John smiles a beat, then he's all business.

          We're doomed. We're doomed.

West turns, hauls off and PUNCHES Smith, knocking him out cold.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Boy, that felt good.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Get us airborne.

Don throws the power switches to full.

<b>EXT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
The landing struts retract. The power drive begins to spin. The
Jupiter Two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses
upon itself. Fire geysers ERUPT. History in about to repeat itself.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I'm going to try to reach escape
          velocity. Maybe we can break the
          gravitational pull.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          No. We don't have the core material.
          The gravity wells will drag us down.

<b>                      WEST

</b>
          We won't make it. Trust me. I know.
          We've got to go down.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          Through the planet as she breaks up.

<b>                      WEST

          That's insane.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
          I don't have time to argue. I'm
          giving you a direct order, Major.

Don and John stare at each other a beat. Then Don smiles.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          Yes Sir.

VIEWSCREEN- CLOSE. The world is breaking up beneath them, revealing a
fiery maw. DON GUNS the engines, heading straight for the chasm.

<b>EXT.-JUPITER TWO

The tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
DON is flying into the shattering center of the planet. Masses of
continents, some bearing forests, others oceans, all soar past.

The tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet.

<b>INT.-JUPITER TWO
</b>
<b>                      JOHN

          There.

A window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away
revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond.

<b>                      WEST
</b>
          I see it.

Don banks the ship toward the opening, flying past exploding fragments
of this shattering world.

The ship clears the planet as the world EXPLODES in the b.g.

She gives him a long, passionate kiss. She lets him go, stunned.

Penny holds Blip in her arms, who has begun to BLIP madly.
