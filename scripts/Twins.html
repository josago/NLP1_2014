</b>               On his 35th birthday, I decided
               to tell Julius Benedict the truth
               about himself...

    A white coated scientist (PROFESSOR WERNER) is studying a
    bizarre piece of equipment that looks suspiciously like
    a milkshake blender. With him is another scientist --
    (this is TRAVEN -- already imperious, already a prick).

</b>               An experiment designed to produce
               a physically, mentally and
               spiritually superior human being.
               I explained that to him when he
               was two years old.

    Werner.

</b>               And it wasn't the complexity of
               Julius's parentage. He knew that
               unlike other little boys, he
               didn't have just one, but half
               a dozen fathers, all very

</b>     Coming down the aisle, checking the passengers, as we
     hear:

               'Cause we're going out tonight...'
     A few passengers turn and look back at --


<b>     JULIUS
</b>     seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo
     suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on
     and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and
     his head bobbing.

               In case some fool might want to
                 fight.'

     The STEWARDESS removes his headphones and considers
     Julius with amusement.
<b>                             STEWARDESS
</b>               I knew you were trouble the second
               I laid eyes on you.
     Julius stares up at her, speechless and mesmerized.

     She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while
     Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.

</b>                  Right.    And I'm a brain surgeon.

     As the Stewardess heads back up the aisle, a MAN jumps
     up, grabs her around the neck with one arm and brandishes
     a gun in his other hand.

                  have a   serious draft in here.

                            stewardess)
                  Get the   captain. I want to
                  discuss   our final destination.

     He continues maneuvering the Stewardess up the aisle.
     His back is totally to Julius now.

</b>     turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's
     clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap.

     The gun at the panicked Stewardess's head, he continues
     slowly up the aisle, shouting for everyone to freeze, not
     even to think about moving --
     -- now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air,
     hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp, fall-
     ing across some seats, the gun dropping from his hand.

     In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass-
     engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in
     control. Julius looks at them a moment, puts on his
     headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the
     music.

     clearly dislikes him.

<b>                               BARTENDER
</b>               It's him.    He's back.

     A pretty young cocktail waitress called MARNIE turns and
     stares daggers at Vince. Marnie is a fireball of a girl,
     all brass and sass on the outside and sweet as cotton
     candy on the inside, sort of a Jean Harlow valley girl.
     She approaches Vince, who greets her with effusive
     warmth.

     occupants of the booth.

     Marnie's sister, LINDA, also a cocktail waitress, slips
     into the booth and gives Vince a big kiss. Linda,
     although just as attractive as her younger sister, has a
     completely different personality: she's trusting,
     dependent, and legally blind when it comes to Vincent.

     and walks away. Linda distances herself a little from
     Vince in the booth, not meeting his eyes.

     getting  his chin at just the right angle. He's concen-
     trating  on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to
     the fact  that the elevator door has opened behind.

     Klane draws   his fist back and is about to drive it into

</b>                  Let me explain something to you.
                  I have a reputation to uphold.
                  People put their trust in me
                  because they know I always deliver
                  the goods and I always come back
                  with the money. This whole thing
                  is making me look very bad...
                  professionally.

                  attendant thought we were off for
                  Hawaii.

                  The parking attendant?

                  those damn loud shirts so we'd
                  look like tourists --

                  surfing. He was a jerk.

     a bullet in each of their foreheads. They lie very still
     and very dead.

       An imposing security gate stands wide open as several

       driveway is filled with cars. Adults and children are
       visible on the grounds; it appears that a party is in
       progress. Julius rings the doorbell, which is answered
       by GRANGER, a man of about 60; he's dressed in swimming
       trunks and sports an impressive physique. He's holding
       the hand of a five-year-old GIRL.

       Julius and Granger look at one another and, for a brief
       moment, hesitate, as if each of them finds the other
       vaguely familiar.

       Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men
       stand up from a nearby table. They each grab one of
       Julius's arms.

       Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as
       it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in
       the head. They're out cold before they realize they've
       been attacked.
       Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front
       of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with
       each others' head. They, too, are now out cold.
       Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might,
       on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle
       his relatives. Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who
       runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it
       over the head of the now hobbling Morris. All five
       Klanes are out cold.

      clothes on hangars. Vince watches him, glances at

      the door.

      Watched by Julius, Marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills
      the overhead lights, all the while providing him with
      glimpses of various parts of her anatomy. She gets into
      one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp.

      onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the
