</b><b>          
</b>          IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down       
          the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
          The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
          Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road
          and through a massive field of emptiness.
<b>          
</b>          The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
          GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
          AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of
          the car.
<b>          
</b>          Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
          General scans his surroundings with concern.

          into the earth.

</b>          They descend a metal staircase and walk with great
          urgency down a narrow corridor. The hallway spills into a
          hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing
          in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading
          them across the room.

          mirror.
<b>          
</b>          On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several
          archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject
          on the other side of the mirror.
<b>          
</b>          The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits
          at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises
          his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT.

          into a coughing fit.

</b>          The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their
          devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black
          Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a
          cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone
          in the corner.

</b>          His voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side
          of the room. Miller leans towards the microphone.

                    question.
<b>          
</b>          A door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out
          wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old
          fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door
          that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private,
          who looks at him in shock.

<b>          
</b>          The Agent in the strange suit reaches the private and
          holds a lighter up to the joint.

<b>          
</b>          Miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. The
          Agent exits the room.

          emerge from behind Miller and start aggressively dragging
          him away.

</b><b>          
</b>          SAUL SILVER is constructing a CROSS-SHAPED JOINT (two
          joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia
          are scattered all over the coffee table. A large
          "Scarface" movie poster hangs on the wall. There is a
          knock at the door and Dale enters.

<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          Dale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house.
          It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale        
          parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off
          the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH!

          Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he

          are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and

          the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse
          - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still

          house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish
          into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired
          Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He
          lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S
          ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips           
          open the paper and examines the weed closely.

                    kids didn't keep that shit on the down
                    low. Which is weird, `cause they really
