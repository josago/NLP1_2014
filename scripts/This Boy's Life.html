<b>1   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                          1
</b>    It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY
    BENNETT sings "Rags to Riches" on the SOUNDTRACK.
    Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a
    highway.
    The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors
    up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile-
    per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and
    cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.


<b>2   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME                        2
</b>    Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her
    son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s,
    she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works
    at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a
    fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and
    energetic and lively. Even more important than these
    qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of
    all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is
    effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes
    and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her.
    The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won-
    derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of
    adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self-
    assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old
    kid.
    Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored
    and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with
    Caroline, who is ignoring him.
<b>                              TOBY
</b>               ... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious
               -- I do.   You promise and promise,
               and then  you change your mind,
               just like  that.
<b>                             CAROLINE
</b>                      (totally oblivious)
               ... Uh-huh.
<b>                             TOBY
</b>               You wait 'til you ask me for
               something. Just wait. See if you
               get it.

</b><b>                            CAROLINE
</b>                     (as above)
              Toby, hush. Let me just...
    So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish
    her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car
    crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with
    relief. She turns to Toby with a smile.
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              What'd you say?
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              I said -- for the twentieth time
              -- if a person promises somebody
              something, they can't just turn
              around and take it back.
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start
              with that again.
<b>                             TOBY
</b>              Why not?
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              Because I'm the mother, and I
              get to tell you what to do every
              minute of your life 'til you're
              eighteen. Seriously, we've got no
              money. I can't buy you the
              moccasins.
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              I bet if you'd promised Roy some
              moccasins he'd of got 'em.

<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto
              the moccasins. We, can't, afford,
              them.
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              Yeah, but you did promise...
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              Sue me. Take me to court. Oh,
              Toby, I know you're disappointed,
              but...
<b>                             TOBY
</b>              Jack.   Call me Jack.

</b>              You're going to drive me to an
              early grave: I'm never going to
              make Salt Lake City.
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              Seriously. If a person can't get
              a stinking miserable pair of
              moccasins, at least he ought to be
              able to choose his own name...
                     (loud)
              ... and I wanna be called Jack!
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              Fine.  And you can call me...
                     (she thinks)
              ... Jeanette. Jeanette Marie.
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              Oh, you're so stupid sometimes,
<b>              I...
</b>    The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both of them
    look through the back window and see a huge tractor-
    trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them.
    Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the
    NASH safely onto the side of the road.
    The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and
    slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the
    next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into
    empty space, its HORN still BLARING.
    Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out
    of the car.


<b>3   EXT. BROKEN GUARD RAIL - DAY                                3
</b>    Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet
    below, the truck lies on its back among boulders.
    Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby
    away, one arm around his shoulder.

<b>4   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - MINUTES LATER                        4
</b>    Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of
    water.
<b>                             CAROLINE
</b>                     (not much heat)
              Goddamn thing.

</b>    She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare
    avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip.
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              Oh, that poor man.
    There is a pause.   Then Toby speaks:
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              I hope to hell this isn't some
              kind of omen.
    Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees
    the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins
    and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove.


<b>5   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - NIGHT                               5
</b>    Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair
    of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing "Mood Indigo"
    together. Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con-
    traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              How's this thing work, anyway?
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>                     (not confident)
              It makes a black light that, uh,
              causes uranium traces to glow.
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              And we just walk along the street
              and find this glowing uranium?

<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              Well, it was everywhere in Moab,
              they say -- just like gold in the
              gold-rush days.
<b>                            TOBY
</b>              But we were too late in Moab, and
              that guy at the office said
              nobody'd found any uranium in Salt
              Lake City.
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              Well, that means we'll have the
              place pretty much to ourselves,
              huh? Honey, this could be a big
              break for us. If this works out,
              oh, just think: we'll get us a
              house, get rid of this damn Nash
              Ambassador -- no money worries...
              It'll be like heaven on a June day.

</b><b>6   INT. CAR - DAWN                                           6
</b>    We hear "MOOD INDIGO" on the car RADIO and see that a
    weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is
    slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then
    opens his eyes.
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              Ask me how far we are from Salt
              Lake City.
    Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a
    small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out.
<b>                            CAROLINE/TOBY
</b>              Forty-seven miles to go!

    Both of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps
    his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells --

<b>7   EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING                                    7
</b>    Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the
    road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and
    Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              If I could have one wish right
              now -- only one wish -- you know
              what I'd like? I'd like to burn
              this damn Nash Ambassador to a
              crisp.
                     (as Toby laughs)
              I'm serious. I hate it. I hate
              the factory that produced it, and
              I hate the man who invented it.

<b>                            TOBY
</b>              It almost makes me want to see Roy
              -- he was the only one could make
              the thing stop overheating.
                     (a beat)
              My God, he was boring. Boring and
              mean: you sure got crappy taste in
              boyfriends.
    At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches
    the bruise on her right cheekbone. Not enjoying the talk
    about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and
    speaks directly to the car.
<b>                            CAROLINE
</b>              I'd like to burn you to the ground.
                     (to Toby; big smile)
              Let's go get rich in Salt Lake
              City!

</b><b>8    EXT. SALT LAKE CITY (DOWNTOWN) - DAY                       8
</b>     Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a
     three-story concrete building. He holds a portable
     RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing "Volare."

<b>9    INT. BUILDING - PARALLEL TIME                              9
</b>     Caroline, holding the imitation Geiger counter, stands
     across the counter from a MAN who is looking at her
     very strangely.
<b>                             MAN
</b>               You're pulling my leg, right?
<b>                             CAROLINE
</b>               No, I came here to look for
               uranium.
<b>                             MAN
</b>               My God, lady. If you're looking
               for uranium, why didn't you go to
               Moab?
<b>                             CAROLINE
</b>               We went there, but everybody'd
               beaten us there. We were too late.
<b>                             MAN
</b>               So you came here just on the
               chance you'd find uranium?
               Listen, you mind me saying
               something to you might sound rude?
               Lady, you got more courage than
               you got common sense.


<b>10   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 10
</b>     Caroline exits the building, dumps the Geiger counter in
     a trash can and strides to the car. She gets in, and
     says two words:
<b>                             CAROLINE
</b>               Don't ask.

<b>11   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 11
</b>     Caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a
     maddening RER-RER-RER-RER noise from the ENGINE:
     wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             7.
</b><b>12   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - TWENTY MINUTES LATER             12
</b>     Caroline and Toby have the hood up and are peering into
     the engine.
<b>                              TOBY
</b>               That mechanic in Colorado said it
               needed points.
<b>                             CAROLINE
</b>               I know. Don't tell me what I
               already know. This thing's a
               bottomless pit. I don't know what
               to do. No matter how much money I
               pour into it...
     Suddenly a WOMAN in pedal-pushers and a thin, inexpensive
     sweater stops. She's vaguely low-class, but friendly and
     sympathetic.
<b>                             WOMAN
</b>               I'd rather be whipped with a belt
               than have car trouble. 'Course
               these days I don't have to worry
               about that. My husband got laid
               off at the mill, and they
               repossessed the car, so wherever
               I wanna go, I just have to hoof
               it, you know?
     Caroline smiles, then her face changes.
<b>                                CAROLINE
</b>               You don't have    a car?

                       shakes    her head)
               You want this    one?

     Shocked, the Woman says --

</b>                      (to the Woman)
               Seriously. It needs points, and
               it overheats constantly, but you
               can have it if you want it,
               because my hand to God, I can't
               look at it one more minute.

     Caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific,
     flat-footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size
     of a dish-pan.

               Let's go!
     Both of them pick up two bags apiece -- all they have in
     the world -- and off they go, feeling good.

     is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed;
     people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children
     carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and

      The place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, Murphy
      beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall.
      Caroline and Toby enter. She pulls down the Murphy

      Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is

     points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire
     it over and over. Caroline starts to clear the table.
     Roy jumps up to help her.

     over her: his hands    are on her breasts, her thighs,
     everywhere. Aroused    in spite of herself, Caroline pulls
     away, indicating the   light in the other room.

     He pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. She fends him
     off, looking worriedly toward the room where Toby's light
     burns.

     Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head
     from the kiss.

     Then it happens.
     A spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves
     Caroline away from him. It's a hard shove, but nothing
     that could really hurt her. Violence has happened before
     between these two, and they recognize it. Caroline is
     immediately on guard, and Roy is apologetic.

     accepts the kiss -- feels she has no choice.

     hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize
     between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby
     streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes
     his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips,
     pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the
     steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow
     a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE
     again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig-
     arette. He looks very young.

      all three boys stare fixedly at the screen. They are

      of the show.
      Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl's breast;
      all three are at least two years from their first shave;
      all three are pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all

      skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by Superman.

     than her, an attractive-enough man. He     is well-built,
     has a full head of brown hair, and very    white teeth.
     Those are his good points. On the minus     side: his over-
     eagerness to please, his nervous smiles    and his clothes.
     He wears two-tone shoes, a hand-painted    tie, and a
     monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond    perfection, in
     the pocket.
     Caroline introduces him to Marian and Kathy.     Then she

     Marian puts a cigarette into her mouth. Dwight jumps up,
     pulls a velvet case from his pocket and extracts a mono-
     grammed Zippo. He snaps open the top of the lighter
     against his leg, and holds the flame in front of Marian's
     face. She lights her cigarette. Then Dwight perform the
     Zippo drama in reverse.

     Atop a small hill, both boys jump off, letting the

     beside him. As the CAMERA TRACKS the car with VARIOUS

                Hunting, too: there's game

<b>32    EXT. SMALL BRIDGE - DAY                                      32
</b>      The three stand by the edge of the bridge, looking down
      into the water.

      They see salmon fighting the last few yards of their
      yearly battle to spawn. Against the rapid current, they
      leap again and again. Long strips of flesh hang from
      their bodies.
<b>                              DWIGHT
</b>                They always show you salmon
                fighting to get upstream, but they
                never show you what they look like
                when they get there.
      Her face strained, Caroline leans over for a closer look.
      The salmon swim in slow, stunned circles, some with an
      eye missing or hanging by a membrane, a hideous sight.
<b>                                 CAROLINE
</b>                It's pitiful.     Awful.
<b>                              DWIGHT
</b>                They'll spawn, and then they'll
                die. They're dying now.

      As Toby and Caroline move to the passenger side of the
      car, Toby speaks so Dwight can't hear:
<b>                              TOBY
</b>                I hope to hell it's not an omen.

      Concrete silo where "Welcome To Concrete" is painted in
      huge faded letters.

                state of Washington, you ask me.
                Lots of churches, too. A neighbor
                of mine says, "Looking for nice
                churches, come to Concrete.
                Looking for sin, go to hell." I

      Caroline and Toby are severely underimpressed with their
      first impression of Concrete.

      Toby get out. The scenery is as beautiful as Dwight said
      it was.

      spoken and sensual, Toby    cannot take his eyes off her.
      The third is PEARL, two    years younger than Toby. Pearl

               Jack Wolff. These are my kids:
               Skipper, Norma and my baby, Pearl.
     Everybody says hello, shakes hands, then they all head
     into the house.

</b>     They enter and look around: well,     it's not awful, but
     it sure as hell isn't wonderful.     The room is dark, on
     the small side, and shows the lack    of a woman's hand.
     Caroline looks a bit taken aback,    but tries to hide it
     by saying the word "nice" over and    over.
     The CAMERA FOLLOWS them FROM room TO room:
<b>                             DWIGHT
</b>               Okay, so that was the living room;
               over here is the kitchen -- I plan
               on getting all new fixtures in
               here -- and down that hall are the
               three bedrooms and the bath.
     He stops at an extra, no-particular-purpose, nondescript
     room furnished only by two easy chairs and a card table.

     He searches, can't think of how to finish the sentence in
     any impressive way. He gives up, finishes weakly:

     Skipper snorts with laughter, but cuts it off when Dwight
     gives him a look. Toby, trying to be good, bites his lip
     to keep from laughing.

</b>     The business area is small and rather forlorn. The six
     of them walk in pairs -- Dwight and Caroline, Skipper and
     Norma, and last, Toby and Pearl. (Toby's eyes are glued
     to the movement of Norma's body.)

               Concrete if you kids would take a
               little initiative. When I was
               growing up we didn't have T.V. --
               we used our imaginations. We read
               the classics. We played musical
               instruments. You show me a bored
               kid, I'll show you a lazy kid.

     Caroline takes a cigarette from her purse. Again Dwight

</b>
     The shooting match has begun. The contestants have ten
     turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's-eye
     fifty yards away. The scores and rankings are on a
     portable scoreboard.
     A contestant finishes SHOOTING. There is a pause.
     Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the
     concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs.
     The score comes:     84.
     There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's
     turn.
     From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good
     shot. He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going
     to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID
     SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then
     his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate
     smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline.

     There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her
     position, and someone in the crowd yells out, "Oh, Mama,
     shake that thang!" Caroline ignores it, taking her
     shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and
     professional-looking.
     She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once,
     deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is
     raised: 93. There is a moment of surprised silence, and
     then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of
     applause.

</b>     Dwight looks stunned, and Toby is almost equally
     surprised.

</b>     On the scoreboard, we see that Caroline is in second
     place and by only two shots. As the next-to-last round
     finishes, Caroline is surrounded by a few people who are
     complimenting her shooting. Dwight's smile is even
     bigger: Oh, he wanted to be the one to win.
     The last round starts. A MAN, evidently the one in first
     place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn. As he
     passes Caroline, trying to rattle her, he speaks
     confidently.
<b>                             MAN

               Then you won't feel too bad about
               carrying it home, will you?
     Several people laugh, and the Man, bested, turns away.
     Everyone turns quiet to watch the Man shoot. He is
     evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he
     SHOOTS and waits, the score is raised: 95. There is
     an immediate stir -- Caroline can win if she shoots a
     virtually perfect round.
     Dwight's name is called. He takes his position, but
     clowns around, SHOOTING first left-handed, then right-
     handed, then with both eyes closed.
     His score is raised: 24. There is scattered laughter,
     and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his
     attitude says.
     Caroline takes her stance. Rock-steady, she SHOOTS her
     TEN SHOTS and waits. And then it comes: 98. She's won.
     The second-place Man wheels away angrily, but everyone
     else congratulates the laughing Caroline, as an official
     presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a
     pedestal, and a huge ham.
     In the midst of the hubbub, Toby manages to get close
     enough to congratulate his mother. Caroline glances
     toward Dwight as she whispers to Toby:

</b>     Toby stands at the top of a small hill with Terry Silver
     and Terry Taylor. They are too casual, their faces too
     innocent: something's up.
     They wait until a middle-aged man raking leaves turns
     and disappears around a corner. Then the three of them
     open the door of a car, take off the emergency brake, and
     start it rolling down the hill.

     another car at the bottom, making a LOUD NOISE.
     The three boys run like the wind out of sight.

     dinner.
<b>                             KATHY
</b>               ... exactly what I wanted for my

               and I'm pretty sure I can make it
               myself. It's got big puff
               sleeves...
     Caroline takes out a cigarette. Then everybody jumps
     as Toby yells and jumps up knocking his chair over
     backwards.
<b>                             TOBY
</b>               Oh!
     Toby grabs Caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate
     Dwight: saying, "Oh!" and "Oh, yes!" and Oh, my!"
     and "Here, let me!" and "I'll do that!"
     It's a mean, accurate imitation of Dwight. All three
     women laugh in spite of themselves. Caroline keeps
     saying "Jack, that's enough," and Marian says, "Dwight's
     not that bad." But they can't help laughing. Toby
     offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom,
     the back door, and the refrigerator a light.

               and started to rummage through the
               garbage cans. But as I reached
               down -- I mean, right down into a
               garbage can -- I suddenly thought,
               'Whoa. Hold on right there,
               Buster.' I went back to my room
               and to this day I haven't smoked
               another cigarette.

          around him is  two feet deep in horse chestnuts. With
          a knife and a  pair of pliers he husks the chestnuts.
          His hands are  covered with scrapes and cuts and the
          chestnut hulls  bleed a juice that has dyed them a
          bright yellow.

          Toby doesn't answer. The two girls move away.    Toby
          sighs, and picks up another chestnut.

          sure he's unobserved, reaches under the mattress
          of Skipper's bed and pulls out several billfold-sized

               that the two of you are getting
               along like a house afire. I'm

     Caroline smiles, smooths his hair, then goes into the

     around and tears out toward the house. By God, he'll
     tell her just what's been going on. He bangs through the
     front door and up the stairs.

          dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room. ELVIS
          SCREAMS OUT the last line, "You can do anything, but
          stay off of my blue suede shoes!"

          They stand up, look around -- Arctic white is every-

     a pale blue suit, and Dwight looks good in a navy single-

     Caroline make love. He takes his lips away from
     Caroline's breast and moves so that his head is at   the
     bottom of the bed. Holding her foot up, he kisses    the
     instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and   then
     down under the arch of her foot. A sexy scene.

     Caroline draws him up   to her, and they kiss. Then
     Dwight turns Caroline   on her side, away from him, pre-
     paring to enter her.    Caroline makes a small sound of
     protest, turning back   toward him.

     By this time Arthur is next to them. Smiling a superior
     smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if
     they were just the oddest things he's ever seen. Then
     his eye falls on Toby's yellow hands.

</b>     Without warning, Arthur swings a fist at Toby, catching
     him on the ear. Arthur's second blow hits him in the
     back of the head.
     The fight is on.
     Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action,
     but there are   so many of them. Before Toby can react,
     Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker
     that puts Toby   on his knees.
     While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick
     him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers
     in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he
     has lost his mind:

<b>                             ARTHUR
</b><b>               GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A

</b><b>               STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL
</b><b>               YOU!
</b>     Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild
     roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to
     Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his
     heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded
     buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and
     begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils,
     still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes
     with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the
     two stagger around the street like drunken dancers.
     They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with
     each other again.
     Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two
     roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment.
     They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting,
     flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur,
     then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each
     breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives
     out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him
     deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby
     throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER
     BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg.
     Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully.
     He looks relieved -- at least it's over.
     No, it's not.
     From behind him he hears three words.
<b>                               ARTHUR

</b>     Toby turns   to see a bloody-faced, swollen-eyed Arthur
     clambering   up the hill after him, like some monster
     that won't   die. Both boys reach the top and stand
     facing one   another.

</b>                No, say 'You're not a sissy.'
     Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful
     but he doesn't care what the hell they think.
<b>                              TOBY
</b>                You're not a sissy.
     Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores
     them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering
     his hated newspapers.

     a wall, resting.

               somebody in the balls, but I like
               this one better: What you  do is

               'til -- hah!
     Without warning, Dwight lunges at Toby and swings the
     side of his arm toward Toby's throat. Toby dodges
     wildly, falling backward over a box of sports equipment.

     side of his forearm toward Dwight's throat. Dwight
     catches the arm easily.

     Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an
     Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a
     corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's
     playing along with the MUSIC, but silently.

     Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes
     the saxophone to squawk.
     The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne
     Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip
     of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet,
     and begins to dance with her.
     A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances
     Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the
     kitchen, around the table, and then back again.
     Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every
     step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight
     kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The
     kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin.

     and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's
     head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure.
     As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline
     back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back

     of all that Caroline had said about staying with Dwight,
     Toby is happy to see Caroline completely back to her old
     self again, joking with him. He grins and, with the palm
     of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove. She
     returns the gesture. And the two of them sit on the

     them are enjoying it. As they finish the song, Arthur

      shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating
      old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, "I know I put
      'em up here somewhere." Then Toby's flashlight lands
      on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had
      held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver
      has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of
      what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough,
      the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver.
      Then Dwight says, "Shit -- the roof must've leaked on
      'em." Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight
      on the ten boxes of chestnuts.
      Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold,
      too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking
      stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a
      breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he
      turns and bangs out of the attic.

      On the TELEVISION we see a distraught Lana Turner   and
      her daughter, Cheryl Crane, as the teenaged girl   is
      led into a tall building.  While we see this, and   then
      a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,   we hear:
<b>                              NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
</b>                ... Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana
                Turner, was held for questioning
                today in the stabbing death of
                Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's
                companion. A spokesman for Miss
                Turner said today that the
                stabbing was an accident, and that
                Miss Turner's daughter will not
                spend even one night in jail for
                what the spokesman called a
                'tragic accident.'
      Suddenly aware of another presence in   the room, Dwight
      turns and sees Toby, who is standing   in the doorway,
      also listening to the NEWSCAST. Toby    is not watching
      the television, though, he is staring   fixedly at
      Dwight.
      Dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the
      Stompanato murder story continues. He turns slowly back
      to Toby, whose eyes are still locked onto his face. The
      SOUND on the TV FADES.

</b>      Toby's basketball game against the Van Horn team is
      starting. Alone among all the other players, Toby wears
      his street shoes. Heavy squarish brogans, they CLOMP,
      and THUD as Toby runs up and down the court.
      The leather soles slip like skates on the highly-polished
      floor, and Toby falls repeatedly. At first the crowd is
      silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these
      strange shoes. Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall,
      and somebody laughs. The crowd in general takes it up,
      and soon there is GENERAL LAUGHTER whenever Toby's shoes
      SQUEAL particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip
      him up or cause another boy to stumble.

      Soon one WOMAN'S HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH DOMINATES the
      gymnasium. The laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless,
      like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation
      comedy.
      Toby sees Norma necking with some guy and is horrified.
      Toby slips and slides, falls and rises. All the while
      his expression is hard as stone: he will get through
      this or die. And, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase
      over and over: "gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get
      out, gotta get out." Finally he makes a basket. One
      VOICE from the audience YELLS out "Okay, kid -- way
      to go!" and then two or three people APPLAUD. Instants
      later, Toby catches a rebound and makes another basket.
      The fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and APPLAUDS
      heartily for the boy in the funny shoes. But Toby's
      expression never changes.

       brakes but the Buick spins and goes sideways into the
       ditch. SILENCE.

       He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the
       left hand then the right, again and again.
       Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face.
       Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps
       the boy's face again and again.
       Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose.      He
       slams his forearm across Dwight's throat.
       Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off
       the covers and tries to run. Still choking, Dwight
       grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face
       down against the mattress.

       Dwight smirks and pulls away. Toby watches the car
       disappear, then spins around and walks into the school.

       The school seems a bit seedier, and two newly-planted
       saplings established in the previous scene are both eight
       feet taller, with wide spreading branches.
       Students pour out    the door. Among them Toby, taller and
       a bit heavier, he    now wears black leather boots, and a
       pack of cigarettes    rolled into the sleeve of his T-shirt.
       His hair is still    pure Elvis.

       Toby comes back out the door with four very different
       friends. CHUCK BOLGER, the most reasonable-looking of
       Toby's companions, is the son of a minister. A second
       boy, known as PSYCHO, is a hulking boy with a tendency
       toward sadism. JERRY HUFF is handsome in a pouty, heavy-
       lidded way. His Elvis pompadour is even higher than
       Toby's. ARCH COOK is an amiable simpleton who sometimes
       talks to himself or laughs for no reason.
       Toby and his four friends pile into Chuck Bolger's '53

      We see that the last two years have marked her. She's

      Dwight seems unchanged by the two years.
      Just now, Dwight is in the middle of telling another of
      his "Dwight Is The Best" stories. From the bored faces
      around the table, this is another in a long series.

                Spat on the floor as I walked by.
                I turned around and walked back
                to him, acting so dainty and
                humble and scared, you know, all

                his eyes off me, BLAM, I dry
                gulched him! I shut his water off
                good! Never gave me another
                second's grief to this very day.
      There is a pause.   One more story.   Nobody has much of a

                Why don't you take a little ride

      The man's eyes bulge with fear, and he cries, "No!    No!"
      as two men escort him out the door.
      In the next shot we see a long black car parked on a
      country road, and we hear a SHOT.

                Oh, Dwight, is that the best you
                can come up with?
      Angered, but keeping his voice low.   He pushes Toby's
      shoulder.

                       (pushes again)
                Huh? Have you? Huh? Now if you
                lived with your daddy Duke and
                his rich wife, maybe things'd be
                different, but he's not here now,
                is he?

                My bathroom. I get to say. Got
                that?
      Still Toby doesn't respond -- Dwight reaches out and
      pinches the skin on Toby's waist, hard. Toby still
      doesn't respond, when Dwight begins to twist it. Toby
      spins around, eyes blazing.

      Furious, Toby throws himself onto the bed, and snaps on
      a reading light.
      (Behind him, the wall is now completely papered with
      the front pages of the Scout magazine, so that we see
      the words BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE
      repeated one hundred and twenty times.) Then Toby takes
      a slick brochure from under his pillow -- it's a bro-
      chure of Princeton. Photographs of beautifully tended
      lawns, and students on their way to class. Toby stares
      at the photographs, smoothing the pages carefully, long-

      Suddenly Chuck Bolger's CAR SCREECHES to a stop next to

      can read "Welcome To Concrete" on it. Toby is leaning
      against a wall in a large derelict Concrete plant staring
      at the silo. Behind him is a small campfire where the
      other guys are slumped around talking. Toby takes a
      long, angry pull on a bottle of whiskey, then turns
      around and heads toward them.

      thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks
      up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to
      see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the
      envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript
      forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes
      his eyes. He's saved.

                like you said.
      Arthur turns and    swishes away. Toby pats   the manilla
      envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks,
      looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left
      hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished
      "Hey," and sinks    to his knees.

      off holding the letters to his chest.

      his back against a tree trunk. Slowly Toby opens the
      fourth letter. Another refusal. Toby tosses it onto
      the ground with the others, leans his head back against
      the tree trunk, and closes his eyes.

      Exasperated that conversation is continuing when he's
      trying to listen, Dwight reaches over, presses his hand
      down on the arm of the record player, then SCRAPES it
      back and forth on the record. It's a violent action, and
      it makes a GROTESQUE SOUND. The NEEDLE BOUNCES around

                Hill was difficult for me, though
                -- classes were hard, and the boys
                seemed cold -- interested in money
                and social position.

                And I hated those snowy
                Pennsylvania winters! But then
                in my last year, something changed.
                The guys in my class grew close,
                so close that I still think of
                them as a second family.

      he won't    be seen.

      where Toby sits. Toby     inches down a bit farther into the
      booth. Arch stops at     a sunglass rack five feet from Toby
      and tries on a couple    of pairs.

      new jar and starts to open it.

      Dwight enters.

                Not a chance. I know a thing or
                two about a thing or two.
      Toby won't rise to the bait, and Dwight falls silent, he,
      looks around and sees the jar of mustard on top of the

      of mustard under the neck of the bottle. He holds it
      close to Toby's face.

      stains on the boy's face.

</b>                Look again, hotshot.    Is it empty?
      Toby jerks his head away, not answering. Dwight slams
      down the jar of mustard, grabs Toby by the back of the
      hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar.

                Now. Now, Mr. Big-Time Prep-
                School fucker, is it empty?
      Toby struggles, but Dwight has the strength of anger:
      trying always to protect his throbbing finger, Toby
      pulls free and jumps up from the table. Dwight is too
      quick for Toby, though: he grabs an even bigger handful
      of hair and forces Toby's face down onto the mustard
      jar again and again. And again. Each time he asks if
      the jar is empty. Finally, Toby gives up.

                All right -- clean it out.
      His face smeared with mustard, Toby's expression is
      murderous. He picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus-
      tard, trying to get up under the neck. He manages to
      get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife, which
      he transfers to the edge of a plate. Dwight watches.

      Dwight slaps Toby across the mouth and the battle is on.
      As Pearl stands frozen, Toby lunges at Dwight, they
      grapple and stagger around the room. GLASS SHATTERS, the
      kitchen table CRASHES over, and their feet STAMP and
      SHUFFLE but Toby is a wild man. Even though he has
      only one good hand. He lands a blow between Dwight's
      eyes that bangs the man back against the wall.

      Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs,
      flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they
      grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a
      broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against
      Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee.
      Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks
      himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby
      hangs on like grim death. Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's
      bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and
      bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he
      can.
      Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously. Pearl in horror,
      Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels
      back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight
      takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him
      down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's
      eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness.
<b>      WHAM!
</b>
      From out of nowhere a baseball bat hits Dwight flat
      across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out  of
      him, stunning him momentarily. As he looks up, we   see
      Caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility  porch
      drawn back, aimed at Dwight's head, ready to strike  again.

      Caroline takes a deep breath, a weight has been lifted.

</b>                My God... the lightness.

</b>                Oh, Dwight, why do you want me to
                stay? You don't even like me,
                not really.
<b>                              DWIGHT

</b>      Dwight makes a terrible noise of frustration and rage,
      doubles his fists, and starts toward Caroline.
      Immediately Toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it
      out, ready to strike, as the two begin to back toward
      the door.
<b>                              DWIGHT
</b>                ... you two've always sided in
                against me, always thought you
                were better than me. I tried. I
                did the best I could. What about
                me? Am I supposed to just crawl
                off in a ditch someplace and die?
                I've always been the nigger.
                Everybody's nigger. Ever since I
                was little.
      Caroline and Toby are at the door, run across the yard
      and down the street. Dwight stands in the doorway,
      yelling:
<b>                              DWIGHT
</b>                What about me? When is it ever
                Dwight's turn for some
                consideration? What about me?
                I'll tell you one thing --
                you'll remember me!

      and catch their breaths.

                Maybe I'll crash and burn, but

                Heaven on a June day!
      Caroline's smile becomes fixed during Toby's speech and
      she begins to regard him oddly.

                Doesn't that sound great? And if
                you get a two-bedroom place in
                D.C., I can come for vacations and
                summers. I'm out. I'm out!

      Caroline's eyes well up, and she lights a cigarette.

                What? Oh, don't cry -- he's not
                worth it.
      As sad as she is, Caroline smiles...

<b>      TOBY
</b>      She holds Toby at arm's length and studies him.
<b>                              CAROLINE

      Then clutches him to her fiercely.   Smiling, the two
      walk on through the sunny afternoon, singing softly to
      each other.

      STARTS the ENGINE. She is close to tears.

                fifty. Buy yourself a blazer.

      Caroline puts her arms around Toby, kisses his cheek
      hard, then whispers something into his ear. When Toby
      speaks, his words are full of love:

</b>                I know that, Mom. I've always

      Caroline gets onto the bus, the DOORS CLOSE, WHOOSH and
      the bus pulls away. We see Caroline's face at a window.
      As the bus recedes, Toby turns and walks in another
      direction. His face is shining, incandescent with
      happiness. He breaks into a wide grin.
