               The CAMERA GRADUALLY pulls back to reveal that Roper is

               A hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars, 
               ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's 
               Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out, 
               weaves through the spectators and past the barriers.

               A FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him.

               heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him...

               Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is 
               setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff 
               are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper 
               saunters in.

               Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing.

                         was busted on possession. But he's

               A tense situation. A wild-eyed, white punk, fuck-up of a 
               BANK ROBBER, EARL, is holding a pretty, young TELLER around 
               the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple.

               The other bank employees are cowering on the floor. A few 
               are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-conscious 
               and oozing blood from his side.

               Roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward 
               Earl, very sociable.

               Earl swipes the donuts out of Roper's hand and starts frisking 
               Roper for weapons with his free hand. The other hand still 
               has the gun poised at the young teller's head.

                         a weapon.

               Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. It seems to 
               help. Earl finishes patting Roper down, straightens back up 
               and puts his hand around the teller's neck.

                         first.

               floor.

                         killed, Earl... Including you.

               Earl is pouring sweat. His gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.

</b>                         I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to 
                         do this the right way.

               Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl. His voice is calm.

</b>                         Debbie's brains are going to be 
                         splattered all over the floor if I 
                         don't see a car in five minutes!

               Roper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Alright! But let's be clear about 
                         one thing. If you kill someone, I 
                         can't help you. The SWAT guys will 
                         take you out.

               Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects 
               for a moment on the reality of the situation.

<b>                                     EARL
</b>                         What are my chances of getting out 
                         of here?

               Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a 
                         bank in Daly City...

               Roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         How ya doin'?

               The guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back 
               the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                              (to Earl)
                         ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost 
                         them on the freeway.

               Earl is encouraged by that.

<b>                                     EARL
</b>                         Really?

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally 
                         your smartest criminals.

               Roper looks directly into Earl's eyes.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         He didn't kill anybody, though.

               Roper bends over the guard.

</b>                         This is gonna hurt.

               He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him 
               across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously.

<b>                                     EARL
</b>                         Hey, leave him alone. What are you 
                         doing?

               Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         It's part of my negotiator's oath. 
                         If there's an injured party and I 
                         can help them, I'm duty bound by my 
                         oath to do that. You can shoot me if 
                         you want, but the next negotiator in 
                         here is going to tell you the same 
                         thing.

               Earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. 
               He lets Roper drag the guard to the door.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         I'll be right back, Earl. Point that 
                         gun away from Debbie.

               Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, 
               then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple.

<b>               EXT. BANK - DAY

               Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on 
               the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of 
               them is Jennings.

<b>                                     ROPER

                         Give me your gun.

               (NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined) 
               Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to 
               him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband 
               under his shirt and vest.

<b>                                     ROPER

                         too stupid to get out of this without 
                         killing somebody.

               Earl watches Roper through the window. He can only see Roper's 
               back. He's getting very agitated.

<b>                                     EARL

</b><b>                         THERE!
</b>
               The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper 
               calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from 
               Earl.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         As a rule, I need one hostage released 
                         as show of good faith.

               Roper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears 
               start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Give me Debbie.

               Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her 
               head.

<b>                                     EARL

               The other hostages watch this exchange tensely.

</b>                         The Old Guy? What kind of show of 
                         faith is that? I want Debbie.

</b>                         You're gettin' the car.

               Earl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. He points at 
               two of the female employees cowering against the counter.

<b>                                     EARL
</b>                         Take them.

               Roper decides that this is the best he's going to get.

</b>                         You two, leave.

               The two women don't need any extra encouragement. They jump 
               up and rush out the front door.

               McCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the 
               two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops.

                         to get your car.

               Roper turns around and walks toward the front door. He stops 
               and looks over his shoulder.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Oh, there's one last thing.

               Earl looks like he's right on the edge.

</b>                         Hardtop.

               Roper turns around, starts walking again. He keeps his eyes 
               focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the 
               bank.

               In one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and FIRES!...

               One SHOT. It tears into Earl's shoulder. One inch from 
               Debbie's neck. Earl is blown back against the counter. Debbie 
               shrieks at the top of her lungs.

               SWAT guys pour in from every entrance. YELLING for everybody 
               to "GET DOWN"! Pointing guns. They pounce on Earl.

               Roper goes to Debbie, puts his arm around her and gently 
               leads her out of the bank.

<b>               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               McCall lowers his rifle as Roper guides Debbie through the

               Roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when 
               he hears the sound of a CAMERA SHUTTER. He turns to see 
               VERONICA (RONNIE) TATE holding the camera. She snaps one of 
               Roper with Earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car.

                         This Greg is really getting in my 
                         way.

               Roper gets down on his knees.

               She takes the lense cap off her camera. Roper primps his 
               hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... CLICK! 
               Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed. He 
               rushes over to his car.

               A REPO MAN stands off to the side watching dispassionately.

               Roper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved 
               Trans Am.

               Lots of activity. Officers in cubicles; talking on phones;

               weaves through the room. Passes by Baffert's desk.

               A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive 
               branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper 
               walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall 
               quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and 
               McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it. 
               He goes into the Captain's office.

                         The Chief says, "Good work this

               Roper smiles as he sits down.

               Solis hangs up. Looks across the desk at Roper. A long pause. 
               He knows he's got leverage.

               Roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk. He 
               takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the 
               empty bottle. He places the bottle on his desk.

               Roper grabs his jacket and walks off, leaving McCall to ponder 
               the problem. McCall looks over at another cop who has been 
               observing. The cop shrugs his shoulders. He hasn't got a 
               clue. McCall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle.

               A slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the

               sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door.

               A real repressed tension here. Someone's about to get hurt. 
               Baffert takes the glass of water.

               He takes a sip. Korda watches him like a cobra. Baffert puts 
               the glass down on the table.

                         appreciate your cooperation, Mr. 
                         Korda.

               Korda smiles. Baffert walks to the door. Opens it to leave...

                         the devil at the crossroads?

               Baffert muses along with Korda.

               Baffert moves off down the hall and Korda closes his door.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Baffert gets into the elevator.

<b>               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
               Baffert takes out his cell phone. Dials.

                              descends)
                         Hello, Judge Stone... This is 
                         Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a 
                         suspect's residence. I'm requesting 
                         a telephonic search warrant in 
                         connection with an armed robbery at 
                         a jewelry store. There's visible 
                         evidence on the premises. Glassine 
                         envelopes with jeweler's markings 
                         were seen in the trash can...

               The elevator hits the first floor.

</b>                         ...I believe a full search of the 
                         premises will turn up some stolen 
                         property...

               The elevator opens.

               Korda is standing there with a knife.

               Baffert has no time to react...

               The knife hand slashes forward... Stabbing the chest and 
               slashing across the throat.

<b>               EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
               Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street, 
               returning from the payphone. Neither of the men take any 
               particular notices of each other. A WOMAN carrying her 
               groceries enters the building.

               Roper gets to the truck. A SCREAM from inside the building.

<b>               INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
               Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his 
               neck and chest. Roper rushes over to him. It doesn't look 
               good.

               The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first 
               flight of stairs. Frozen. Roper pulls out his gun and rushes 
               by her up the stairs.

<b>               INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               Roper arrives at the top of the stairs. Korda's door is ajar. 
               Duke Ellington can be heard faintly.

<b>               INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT
</b>
               Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... 
               No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a 
               door. Roper races out.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it 
               open. Gun aimed.

<b>               INT. APT. 302 - NIGHT
</b>
               A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds 
               up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he 
               leaves.

<b>               EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
               Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. 
               Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that 
               Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches.

               Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window 
               looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone.

               tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits.

               Solis' hallway.

               Thru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers

               Roper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard.

               Roper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door 
               opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed 
               casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and 
               earrings.

               Roper enters. Instantly we see he's at home here. He hangs 
               his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices 
               a photograph on the wall. Quite imposing. Very unique style.

               Roper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts 
               turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's 
               ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch 
               and his head in Roper's lap.

               Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his 
               presence. His words are light. His tone isn't.

               He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to 
               him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie

               He grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside 
               waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his

               to follow Roper. She calls after him.

               A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE 
               TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of 
               coffee to go. He enters the warehouse.

               around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt.

               Clarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a 
               twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from 
               striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay.

               Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add 
               up in his head.

               Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers 
               the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper 
               again.

               Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around 
               again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against 
               his chest.

               Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks 
               to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling.

               A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, 
               reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in

               McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot 
               from a nearby "Mr. Coffee" machine. It's filled with water. 
               He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle.

               McCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk, 
               then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies". He looks at 
               the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the

</b>
               Several Patrol Cars are parked in front of an unappealing 
               apartment building. A crowd has begun to gather. UNIFORMED 
               POLICEMEN hold them back. TWO COPS are questioning a man 
               wearing only green slacks. No shirt. No shoes. Just the 
               slacks. He is very agitated.

               The pickup screeches up. Roper and McCall hop out. Roper 
               flashes his badge to the OFFICER in charge. (OFFICER #1)

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Roper. Metro Division. Hostage 
                         Negotiator. Give me the short version.

<b>                                     OFFICER #1
</b>                         Husband came home. Found that guy 
                         and his wife "in flagrante". Now 
                         he's holding her at knife point.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Which apartment?

               The Officer points up to the third floor.

<b>                                     OFFICER #1
</b>                         That one with the bars on the windows.

               Roper nods. Walks back over to the pickup. Looks up. Eyeballs 
               the building.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         How are we gonna get him out of there?

</b>                         We could fill it with water.

               Roper throws him a look. McCall walks to the back of the 
               pickup, reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel 
               bag.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                              (to Officer #1)
                         Have you evacuated anyone?

</b>                         Only that floor.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Is the hostage injured?

<b>                                     OFFICER #1
</b>                         Don't know. She keeps screaming to 
                         stay out. He keeps screaming to stay 
                         out. We decided to stay out.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Well, there's a good amount of 
                         agreement on that.

               McCall slams the truck door, sniper rifle in hand.

<b>                                     MCCALL
</b>                         I'll take "highground" until SWAT 
                         gets here.
                              (surveying the area)
                         I can get a good sight-line from 
                         that roof across the street.

               McCall marches off across the street.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying 
                         to limit the force here.

               McCall calls back over his shoulder.

</b>                         I know my job.

               At that moment, a scream echoes down from the third floor 
               window. Roper heads for the front door of the building.

<b>               INT. APT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - (ACROSS THE STREET)
</b>
               McCall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop.

<b>               INT. 6TH ST. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
               The screams are getting more panicky. Roper comes down the 
               hall quickly. The door to the apartment is open. It's been 
               that way since the guy in the green slacks fled. Roper hurries 
               toward the door.

<b>               INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
               The WIFE is in bra and panties and the HUSBAND is 6'4". He's 
               giving her a good beating. It's a studio apartment. Unmade 
               bed. Belongings strewn all over. Window open with sun 
               streaming in, and a good view of the building across the 
               street. We hear ROPER'S VOICE from out in the hall.

<b>                                     ROPER (V.O.)
</b>                         I'm coming in. I'm not armed.

               The husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife 
               to her throat.

<b>                                     WIFE

                         Stay the fuck out of here!

               But Roper steps into the apartment. Sees the wife. Face 
               swollen. Knife to her neck. The enraged husband, contemplating 
               murder. One inch from committing the act. Roper doesn't bat 
               an eye.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         I know how you feel, Ray.

                         you leave.

               He presses the knife against the wife's throat. She winces. 
               Her chest heaves.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                         I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my 
                         negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the 
                         room with the hostage, I have to 
                         stay.

                         to do to her.

</b>                         Let me show you something, Ray.

               Roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet. He 
               extracts a photo.

</b>                         Ray, think about how she looked when 
                         you married her. Think about how 
                         happy you were. Don't lose that, 
                         man. Don't give up everything.

                         bed.

               And now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not 
               that coherent.

               Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife 
               clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes 
               closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat... 
               Then...

               It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has 
               to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns 
               and goes to get his coat.

               He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat. 
               POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor. 
               The wife runs out of the room, screaming!

               He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the 
               carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. 
               He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A 
               couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper 
               bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds 
               down the stairs... down another flight...

               McCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat. 
               McCall's face softens just perceptibly.

               He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed, 
               contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses 
               the sheet over Ray's dead body.

               Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked 
               "Internal Affairs". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the 
               floor. Waiting.

               The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal 
               affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on 
               the back.

               McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear 
               back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled 
               off considerably. Even a tad friendly.

               A neighborhood bar. Roper and McCall are playing pool. Half-
               finished beers are on a nearby table. McCall is bent over 
               the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. Roper 
               studies him.

               A beat and then McCall realizes that this comment is a major 
               acknowledgement of acceptance from Roper. Roper misses his 
               shot. Picks up his beer glass.

               Roper takes a drink of beer. Nears the bottom of his glass. 
               Calls to the BARTENDER.

               We're looking at a door. It's not clear where we are. McCall

               It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience 
               store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to 
               represent a hostage situation. The "BAD GUY" has a walkie-
               talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out 
               of it.

                         everyone in this place.

               McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response. He seems 
               stiff and awkward.

               the other walkie-talkie.

               McCall is tired of guessing.

               McCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back 
               to the side door.

               McCall comes through the door. Hands in the air. The setup 
               in the room has been changed a bit. The bad guy is behind 
               the counter. Several hostages in various positions on the 
               floor.

               McCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper 
               turns him away from the hostage scene.

                         A dirtbag behind the counter holding 
                         a sawed-off. A Berretta nine 
                         millimeter in his belt. A female 
                         hostage, red dress, on the floor in 
                         front of the cereal display. Male

                         three feet to her right. Another 
                         male hostage, white pants, green 
                         shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the 
                         magazine rack. A female dirtbag with 
                         a gun under her shirt, sitting against 
                         the beer cooler, trying to pass 
                         herself off as a hostage, and there's 
                         a special on toilet-paper, four for 
                         a buck twenty-nine.

               McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed.

</b>                         Very good. You've got good eyes. 
                         That's important.

<b>               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Roper and McCall are sitting in the dark watching a video 
               tape. It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting 
               goods store. A negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a 
               ten year old girl hostage. The negotiator holds his hands 
               out imploringly... Carefully moves toward the gunman. The 
               negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. The gunman 
               grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his 
               head. The little girl runs out of the picture to safety.

               Roper remains dead silent during all this. McCall looks over 
               at him. The blue light flickers over Roper's motionless face.

<b>                                     MCCALL
</b>                         Was that your partner?

               Roper nods.

</b>                         Why did he do it?

</b>                              (quietly)
                         Because he knew the little girl had 
                         zero chance of survival and his 
                         chances would be a little better... 
                         We had a plan, but SWAT opened up 
                         too early. He got caught in the 
                         crossfire.
                              (a sad beat)
                         Let's move on... Notice this. Always 
                         use the eyes to keep the connection. 
                         It almost like hypnosis. That's the 
                         most important thing. Create a 
                         connection. You're always on their 
                         side...

               McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back 
               on the screen.

<b>               EXT. GOLDEN GATE RACETRACK - DAY

               Beautiful day. Roper and McCall leaning against the rail at 
               the walking ring. The horses are being paraded and saddled. 
               Roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye. McCall seems 
               totally disinterested.

               Roper ignores that.

</b>                         Because there are a multitude of

                         to see if you know what to look for. 
                         You have to read the conditions, 
                         just like in a hostage situation.

               Roper points across the ring to a particular horse.

                         No works. Front wraps. Looks like 
                         he's broken down. But notice the 
                         woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. 
                         She wouldn't have come if her horse 
                         was broken down. He's live. We use 
                         him.

                         off... Now the Six looks good. On 
                         his toes. Coat shiny. This 
                         trainer/jockey combo does well. We

               other bettors, the odds board, all the monitors... Strange 
               place. Roper finishes and turns away from the window. Hands 
               McCall a ticket.

               It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story. 
               The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of 
               Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are 
               standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on 
               a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of

               Roper looks over there, gives no reaction. They reach Solis' 
               convertible Cadillac. It's parked out front of the travel 
               agency building.

                         straight out of impound for fourteen

                         "misunderstanding".

               Roper is as serious as we've ever seen him.

               Korda disappears back behind the door.

<b>               EXT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Roper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical 
               officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are 
               being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis, 
               McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for 
               his report.

<b>                                     ROPER
</b>                              (flatly)
                         We're going to have to take this guy 
                         out.

               That draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely 
               says.

</b>                         Can't we wear him down?

               Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis 
               eyes it with dismay.

</b>                         I believe there's at least one 
                         fatality in there already. The fire 
                         alarm was probably set off by gunfire. 
                         I believe he's working alone, both 
                         from his conversation and the fact 
                         that he wouldn't come out beyond the 
                         doorway. He was holding a gun on the 
                         hostages while he was talking to me. 
                         His demeanor is calm and controlled, 
                         that's what really scares me. The 
                         other bad news is that he also 
                         indicated a familiarity with our 
                         techniques.
                              (a beat)
                         So, do you want to go in or wait for 
                         him to come out?

               McCall calmly offers his opinion.

               Solis nods. That'll be the plan.

                         from the curb.

               The underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at 
               Roper dejectedly.

                              (big pause)
                         Yet.

<b>               INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
</b>
               The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda. 
               His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five 
               very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The 
               male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO 
               SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER, 
               gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against 
               the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The 
               guard and one of the jewelers.

               Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler 
               and motions to the dead bodies.

</b>                         Drag them behind the counter.

               The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the 
               grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The 
               older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of 
               reality. Her eyes are a bit far away.

               Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't 
               been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, 
               reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open 
               satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones 
               and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to 
               her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She 
               starts walking toward the front door frowning with 
               dissatisfaction.

                         No, Mrs. Dotson.

               He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags 
               her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a 
               step toward Korda.

<b>                                     MANAGER
</b>                         Leave her alone!

               Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her 
               unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.

               The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks 
               about making a run at him.

<b>                                     SALESGIRL #2

                         Sit down, Doug.

               A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with 
               the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old 
               woman. Korda looks down at her.

                         her.

               Korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of 
               the gems.

               The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store.

               Just then, the front door of the jewelry store swings open. 
               A spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway. Korda is 
               discharging a fire extinguisher.

               Through the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled 
               around the figure in the ski mask. They slowly shuffle toward 
               the Explorer.

               wavers in and out of the crosshairs, shielded momentarily by 
               the jeweler, then he flashes back into the crosshairs. The

               Korda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view 
               mirror. The Cadillac is making up ground.

<b>               UP AHEAD
</b>
               a squad car SCREECHES into the intersection and smokes to a 
               stop. Korda jerks the wheel, pulls a SCREAMING right turn 
               and heads up the hill.

<b>               EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
               The Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van... 
               Brakes SQUEALING, it swerves around the corner in pursuit.

<b>               THE VAN
</b>
               hits the top of the hill and goes airborne... SLAMS back 
               down to the pavement.

               Korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the 
               windshield as they head straight downhill. The salesgirl is 
               beyond petrified.

<b>               THE CADILLAC

               reaches the top of the hill. Going fast.

<b>               INT. CADILLAC
</b>
               As it rocks forward violently. Front bumper slamming against 
               the pavement. McCall sees the van ahead. Hammers the 
               accelerator. No fear.

               Korda sees traffic ahead... Intersection jammed. He pulls a 
               hard left.

</b>
               cuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk... 
               shears a mailbox... a row of newspaper machines fly through

<b>               THE CADILLAC
</b>
               arrives at the intersection a few seconds later... 
               Intersection still jammed... People now standing on the corner 
               gawking at the damage. The Caddy SCREECHES to a stop. McCall 
               HONKS... The people scatter... The Cadillac drives through 
               the corner.

<b>               THE VAN
</b>
               Wrong way down a one-way street. Cars coming right at us in 
               every angle. Frantic HONKING. Salesgirl SHRIEKS. Tires 
               SMOKING... No way to avoid collision... Except Korda pulls a 
               left an instant before impact... The van speeds back up the 
               hill.

<b>               THE CADILIAC

               Korda, checking the rear view mirror. The Caddy is a short 
               distance behind. Attention still focused behind, Korda enters 
               an intersection, running a red light... CROSS-TRAFFIC... 
               Korda stiffens... Pulls on the wheel

<b>               THE STREET

               The van swerves... But not quick enough... GRINDING metal... 
               SHATTERING glass... The van rolls over another car...

<b>               BRIEF CUT - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               Korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a

<b>               THE VAN
</b>
               ...and CRASHES back down to the street upside down. After a 
               beat, Korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of 
               jewels. The salesgirl does not emerge. He spots a cable car 
               reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend. 
               He heads toward it...

<b>               INT. CABLE CAR

               As Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the 
               passengers view him uneasily.

<b>               THE CADILLAC
</b>
               hits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to 
               see Korda leap onto the moving cable car.

<b>               CABLE CAR
</b>
               other passengers give Korda room. They can sense that he is 
               not here merely for the ride. Korda looks out the back...

               Roper and McCall haven't lost track of him. The Cadillac is 
               making up ground on the cable car.

               Korda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and FIRES off a 
               couple of shots at the Caddy.

<b>               INT. CADILLAC
</b>
               A bullet fractures the windshield. McCall swerves.

<b>               BACK ON THE CABLE CAR
</b>
               That makes up the minds of many of the passenger. They leap 
               off the cable car.

               Korda takes aim on the Caddy again and FIRES!

               The brakeman charges down the aisle while Korda has his 
               attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off 
               the cable car...

               Almost works... but Korda is able to hang on by one hand... 
               He swings around toward the Brakeman who turns involuntarily 
               as he sees the barrel of the gun pointed at him... BANG! 
               Korda shoots him in the back.

               The brakeman staggers down the aisle and slumps across the 
               brake lever, releasing it more.

               Now driverless, the cable car picks up speed... Broadsides a 
               car... Pushing it into parked cars...

<b>               THE CABLE CAR
</b>
               Korda and the remaining passengers are rocked around.

<b>               THE CABLE CAR

               It passes the smashed car. McCall looks at the speedometer 
               as he paces the cable car. It's going at 45 mph.

               The cable car barrels through... Plows into two cross-traffic 
               cars... Knocks them aside... Keeps picking up speed.

<b>               THE CADILLAC

               Weaves through the wreckage... Makes up ground on the cable

<b>               THE CABLE CAR

               For the moment, Korda is not shooting at the Caddy. His 
               attention is now focused downhill as...

               The cable car nails another vehicle sending it spinning off 
               to the side.

<b>               THE CADDY

               dodges the spinning car... Jumps up onto the sidewalk... 
               Mows down parking meters... Jumps back onto the street.

<b>               THE CABLE CAR

               Korda leans out the door, takes aim at the Caddy... Another 
               jammed intersection up ahead...

               SLAMS into the back of the car. Major impact.

<b>               THE CABLE CAR

               Korda and the passengers are thrown to the floor.

<b>               THE REAR-ENDED CAR

               Tumbles down the hill... Hits a car coming uphill and rolls 
               into a parked car.

<b>               THE CADILLAC
</b>
               Speeds up alongside the cable car. Roper climbs over the 
               windshield, onto the hood and leaps onto the cable car.

<b>               INT. CABLE CAR

               Korda sees him coming. FIRES. Roper dives out the other side 
               of the cable car.

               Roper hanging off the side. He gets his gun out of his 
               holster...

               Up ahead, a car pulls away from the curb...

               Roper swings around to get back into the relative safety of 
               the cable car. As he does his gun is raked out of his hand 
               by the car which avoids a collision by a millimeter.

               Korda aims as Roper re-enters...

<b>               CABLE CAR

               As it CRASHES into the back of a car turning left.

               Everyone is thrown toward the front of the car. Korda's gun 
               goes flying. Roper dives on top of him. They trade punches. 
               McCall is in b.g. with the Caddy pacing the cable car.

               Roper hammers Korda into unconsciousness. Outside McCall is 
               honking and yelling like crazy. Roper looks over... McCall 
               points ahead...

               Leaps to the brake lever. Pulls on it.

               The clamp tries to slow the descent. It whine and smokes... 
               Then disintegrates before our eyes.

<b>               THE CABLE CAR
</b>
               Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car 
               is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop 
               it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy...

<b>               INT. CADDY

               He lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down 
               on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car... 
               McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the 
               steering wheel hard right...

<b>               EXT. STREET

               The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires 
               SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber 
               forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac... 
               But it's working. The cable car is slowing.

<b>               BOTTOM OF STREET

               The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on 
               them. General hysteria as they flee.

<b>               THE CABLE CAR
</b>
               Korda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs 
               the satchel and bails out of the cable car...

<b>               STREET
</b>
               ...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its 
               brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs 
               into an underground garage.

<b>               THE CABLE CAR
</b>
               Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper 
               grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy 
               to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in 
               astonishment.

<b>               INT. GARAGE - DAY

               Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position. 
               He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He 
               glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over 
               the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the 
               garage... Footsteps maybe.

               Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun...

<b>               INT. THIRD LEVEL - GARAGE

               Lots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to 
               the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans 
               beneath the cars... No sign of Korda.

               Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van... 
               Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward 
               the window.

               A dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth... 
               Roper moves on.

<b>               NEW ANGLE

               As a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps 
               into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The 
               BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution.

               Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 
               year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat.

               The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives 
               off.

<b>               INT. GARAGE

               Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final 
               scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might 
               have escaped.

               He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires... 
               Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives 
               and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield.

               The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the 
               path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make 
               it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear 
               window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail 
               and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it.

<b>               GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL

               As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and 
               piles into a parked car.

               Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel 
               of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck.

               Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the 
               satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car 
               door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his 
               gun right up between Korda's eyes.

               Korda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't 
               kill him in cold blood...

               What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about 
               those rules at this moment.

               And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all 
               inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night.

               He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter 
               against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing 
               this guy.

               Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin. A pull of the 
               trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull. 
               And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed. 
               Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst 
               out of his skin.

               Long, long beat. Roper eases up and Korda smiles. Just when 
               we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks 
               Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls 
               his head back and shoves the gun in his face.

               Korda is doubled up coughing, spitting up blood. Roper walks 
               away as McCall moves in to put the cuffs on Korda.

               soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a 
               hanger. She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to...

               Dark. She turns on the light. She goes to the mirrored 
               medicine cabinet.

</b>
               Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so 
               slightly. She opens the medicine cabinet. Takes out some 
               perfume. Dabs some on her neck. She puts back the bottle and 
               closes the cabinet. We fully expect someone to be standing 
               right behind her in the reflection... There's no one there. 
               She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom.

               Ronnie walks back to the kitchen... Notices something on the 
               floor further down the hallway... What is it? She moves 
               closer... And now we get to the POV that tells us someone is 
               in the house... Watching her through a cracked doorway.

<b>               BRIEF CUT
</b>
               A hand opening a buck knife. Water drips from the fingers.

<b>               BACK IN THE HALL
</b>
               Ronnie bends down. It's a wet spot. Like half a shoeprint. 
               She reaches down to touch it...

               BUZZZZZ!!!! The oven timer. She hurries back to the kitchen.

<b>               INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
               She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the 
               oven. She puts it down on the counter and cross to the 
               refrigerator. She opens the door and looks inside. The 
               refrigerator door obscures half the FRAME... She digs around 
               for something... We're sure that when she closes the door, 
               he's going to be behind it... She takes out a head of lettuce 
               and... Closes the door... Still no one there.

               She turns... Clarence is standing there. Dripping wet. Ronnie 
               shrieks... The knife flashes forward... She grabs the lid 
               from the sauce pan and CLANG... Fends off the blade. She 
               bolts for the hallway. Clarence grabs her by the blouse... 
               RIP! She pulls away.

<b>               IN THE HALLWAY
</b>
               She races down the hall. Clarence lunges into FRAME. She 
               goes down... He goes down... the knife goes skidding down 
               the hallway... Ronnie scrambles to get it... Clarence has 
               her by the ankle... She claws for the knife... Just out of 
               reach.

               Roper's pickup pulls up in front. He gets out. Paco jumps 
               out behind him. It's raining harder. They hurry up the walkway 
               toward the house. Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine. 
               He goes back to the truck. Paco pads after him.

               Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the 
               wine. He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check 
               himself in the window.

               Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front 
               bay windows. It SPARKS and FLASHES. Still plugged in, it 
               bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house. 
               FLICKERING and FLASHING.

               Roper rushes toward the house... Crashes through the front 
               door... Up the stairway... Paco bounds after him... Roper 
               hits her front door running... Wham! He bounces off. He 
               shoulders it again... The door doesn't give... He pulls out 
               his gun... BAM! BAM! Shoots off the lock.

               Ronnie is laying on the floor, gasping for air. Choke marks 
               around her throat. Roper rushes to her side. Paco is on his 
               heels.

               She nods. Points out the back way.

               The dog obediently stays with Ronnie. Roper dashes out the 
               back.

<b>               EXT. BACK OF RONNIE'S - NIGHT
</b>
               Raining more heavily now. Roper bursts out onto the back 
               porch. Sees Clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire 
               escape to the alley. Roper flies down the fire escape... 
               Vaults the last flight and races after Clarence.

<b>               EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               Clarence sprints down the block... Through the intersection... 
               HONK! SCREECH! A car barely misses him. It does a one-eighty 
               on the rain-slick pavement. Clarence disappears into the 
               shadows. Roper arrives a beat later... Streaks through the 
               intersection... Into the shadows.

<b>               EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               This one is steep. Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. He 
               shoots into a doorway. Tries the door. Locked. He looks back. 
               Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep 
               street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots 
               him crossing and picks up the pace. He can see that Clarence 
               is faltering.

<b>               NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL
</b>
               Clarence staggers into an alleyway...

<b>               EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               Narrow, dark and dripping with rain. Roper arrives at the 
               mouth of the alley. Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes 
               adjusting to the darkness. The PATTER of rain off the 
               rooftops. His FOOTSTEPS. No other sound.

               He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out. 
               Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight. 
               Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising 
               into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks 
               another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked. 
               Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light 
               of the street... Slowly...

               The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down 
               out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife. He catches Roper 
               across the arm.

               Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun 
               CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence 
               has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car 
               and grabs the gun...

               Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence 
               down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the 
               street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights 
               like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him 
               on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.

<b>               WIDER SHOT
</b>
               Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. Coming quickly. 
               Roper sees this. He rolls out of the way, abandoning the 
               battle for the gun. Clarence struggles to his knees. Turns 
               the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of 
               the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights. 
               Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM! 
               He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body 
               lands limply 30 feet down the street. The CABBY gets out of 
               his vehicle.

</b>                         Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!

               Roper walks down the hill to the body. The cabby follows.

</b>                         There was no way I could miss him.

               Roper ignores the cabby. He looks down at Clarence's body, 
               contemplating something.

<b>                                     CABBY

               The cabby immediately clams up.

               receiver as Roper picks up his.

               Roper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the

                         over him is the coroner.

               Korda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His 
               countenance is now a study in hate.

               Vet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped

               McCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead 
               threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the 
               wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's 
               heart jumps into his mouth.

               McCall is tense and stiff. He stammers.

               rescue vehicles are on the scene. Everybody looking straight 
               up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over 
               the side of the building.

               Walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat, 
               eyes closed, praying.

               Dave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost 
               the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those 
               eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead.

               Dave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter 
               forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the 
               armrests of his wheelchair and then:

               McCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer 
               act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see 
               what the effect is. Dave turns back around.

               Now he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his 
               beeper.

               Dave tries to feel for particles. Tears form in Dave's eyes.

               Dave is suddenly lost in thought again. His expression turns 
               to a frown:

               Then with sudden swiftness.

               Dave pushes the wheelchair forward. McCall LUNGES for the 
               wheelchair but doesn't make it. Walter SCREAMS as he falls.

               of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps 
               to ground. He then falls backward between the two cars,

               Roper reaches over, easing it further open -- inside a set

               Roper thinks a moment, then turns, looking out the back of

               At one end near the chain link fence, Roper's pickup

               Roper cautiously drives toward the gate -- the CHAIN securing

               As he drives past we see that the bed of the truck has been 
               loosely covered with a TARP.

               Roper drives on, winding through the maze of roadways, huge

               In response he HEARS Korda's VOICE, eerie, almost a whisper, 
               coming from everywhere and nowhere as if emanating from the

               A momentary anxious look from Roper, then he walks to the 
               bed of the truck, pausing a moment, gripping the cover before 
               whipping it back, revealing... Ronnie's LUGGAGE.

               At the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the

               On the floor he SEES a shadow cast - Korda. He moves to the

               Roper hangs onto the bag -- there's 'four million in jewels' 
               in there -- all he has to bargain with.

               A LIGHT SWITCH is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming

               Korda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held 
               down with TAPE.

               Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN, 
               very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table 
               keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade.

               Korda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases 
               his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it.

               We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', 
               his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at 
               this point.

               Roper, who can't move...; who won't move.

               The car flies past him, the SIDE MIRROR catching Roper's 
               shirt, tearing it, a flash of BLOOD from his arm...

               The car then collides with a series of PIPES crossing the 
               floor, STEAM erupting in every direction as the car then 
               slams into several PROPANE BOTTLES stacked near the benches, 
               a series of EXPLOSIONS ripping through the building. . .

               The CAR explodes from the building, GLASS FLYING, the car 
               rolling, flipping over, coming to a rest on its wheels, 
               driver's side away from McCall's position.

               coming out of the box, it's SHORTING... Only a few more 
               seconds...

               Desperately his eyes search the floor, SEEING a HUGE WRENCH. 
               He grabs the wrench, jamming it between the GEARS in the 
               gearbox, the gears shuddering violently, threatening to crush 
               the wrench...

               Roper runs to Ronnie's side, frantically pulling at her bonds, 
               the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her...

               Hammering and clanking, the wrench can't last a heartbeat

               Pulls the last of the restraints away...

               Just as the massive gears crush the wrench, the table

               The blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper

               Korda is slumped over the wheel. He looks dead. McCall slings 
               his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a DRAIN PIPE 
               attached to the side of the building.

               Korda is not quite dead...

               The door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one 
               hand, AUTOMATIC in the other. He looks up, SEEING McCall.

               He OPENS FIRE, McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as 
               BULLETS hit the wall around him.

               McCall whips out his REVOLVER, RETURNING FIRE, a GUN BATTLE

               He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then 
               crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom 
               of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the 
               cavernous, machine-choked building.

               Leaps up and FIRES, McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking 
               him to the ground. The SLIDE to Korda's AUTOMATIC has kicked 
               open, out of bullets. He drops the gun, picks up the BAG and 
               runs alongside the machine shop.

               Exits the machine shop, SEEING McCall on the ground, Korda 
               nowhere in sight. Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping 
               to his side.

               Roper sprints towards the building, racing alongside it, 
               catching a glimpse of Korda just as he disappears around the 
               other end. Roper charges on...

<b>               EXT. MACHINE SHOP - REAR - DAY

               Korda runs past the building, still clutching the BAG. He 
               runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock 
               area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from 
               the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner 
               of the next building.

<b>               KORDA

               Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it, 
               jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts 
               the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view.

               With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES, 
               two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the 
               truck still speeding towards him. Roper's gun jams. Roper 
               leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he 
               grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper 
               blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand.

               Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a 
               building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on.

               Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right, 
               SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he 
               can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put, 
               clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to 
               avoid the obstacles.

               Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING, 
               PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers 
               the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the 
               pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through 
               the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with 
               his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the 
               cab...

               In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame 
               of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls 
               over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck 
               along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH.

               Leaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching 
               the dry dock area.

               In the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and 
               other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD 
               he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift 
               movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the 
               2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel, 
               past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, 
               pinning it to the floor.

               As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door frame, 
               locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine SCREAMING 
               wide open. Korda reacts in panic...

               Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the DRY DOCK
