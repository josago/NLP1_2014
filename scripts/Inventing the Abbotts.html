       OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED
       ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large
       striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long
       steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn,
       practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall
       center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up
       sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and
       ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the
       tent assumes its full and finished form.

       -- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The
       residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the
       commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching
       trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand
       promenade.

       JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their
       way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and
       seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is
       rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular
       culture chameleon who takes on the colors and
       affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment
       (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley).

       Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent
       on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent
       indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the
       many parties they throw every year).

<b>                                 DOUG
</b>                   Didn't get invited, huh?

<b>                                 JACEY
</b>                   Go to hell.

</b>                   Who cares? I'm not going and I
                   got invited.

<b>                               DOUG
</b>                 Pam, I guess. I don't know.
                 Didn't open the envelope. I mean,
                 come on, every time an Abbott girl
                 gets her period they have some
                 party.

<b>                                 JACEY
</b>                 Oh, shut up.

<b>                                 JACEY
</b>                 Shut up!

       Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm --
       Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely
       interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as
       LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway
       and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed-
       and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he
       exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent
       pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by
       Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper
       humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns
       and walks down the block.

       ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker.
       Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very
       popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott
       daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and
       discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down
       the busy hall.

</b>                 Well, now you are. But if you're
                 mad at me you don't have to come.

       She gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a
       classroom as the BELL RINGS. The corridor is quickly
       vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of
       Eleanor's smile.

       ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard
       house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping-
       pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage
       that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950
       Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway.
       The garage doors are open and the garage light is on.

       We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of
       "Heartbreak Hotel" in his best Elvis fashion.

<b>6   INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)             6
</b>
    Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a
    coat and tie) still singing "Heartbreak Hotel" while he
    carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen
    and a bottle of India ink. Jacey's reflection appears in
    the mirror behind Doug -- he's wearing a coat and tie too.
    Jacey does a pained take on Doug's handiwork:

<b>                            JACEY
</b>              Oh, Christ!

<b>7   INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOURMINUTES LATER)         7
</b>
    HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was
    grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when
    Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the
    matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious
    woman without interest in appearing to be anything other
    than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two
    teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches
    second grade at Haley Elementary School.)

<b>                            JACEY
</b>              He has to wash it off, Mother.
              You cannot let him go to the party
              unless he washes it off.

<b>                            DOUG
</b>              It'll look worse if I wash it.
              It's India ink, it'll turn gray,
              it'll look like dirt.

<b>                            JACEY
</b>              He looks like such a clown and he
              doesn't even know it! He doesn't
              get how things work in this town.
              I thought you weren't even going
              to the party?

<b>                            DOUG
</b>              Changed my mind.

<b>                            HELEN
</b>              Doug, you do understand that you
              may be the only person at this
              party with artificial sideburns?

<b>                            DOUG
</b>              Yeah.

<b>                            HELEN
</b>              You do understand that your
              sideburns don't look real?

    Doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he
    conceals his disappointment and nods:

<b>                                 DOUG
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                 That they look, really, as though
                 you'd drawn them on?

<b>                                DOUG
</b>                         (swallows, then
                          shrugs)
                 Yeah.

       She looks hard at Doug for a beat, then turns to Jacey.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                 Well, darling, it seems he does
                 understand. Why don't you just go
                 on to the party and ignore Doug.
                 Just have a good time and pretend
                 you don't even...


       Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front
       door before his mother can finish her sermon.


<b>8EXT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT                    8
</b>
       The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band
       playing "QUE SERA" and the sounds of the party as Doug
       lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns
       and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into
       the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks
       up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent.
       Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac,
       caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.


<b>9INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT                                        9
</b>
       Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a
       tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand.

       Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls
       over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother
       has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor.

       They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines
       (Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy,
       waiting like predators for their chance to dance with
       Eleanor.

<b>                               ELEANOR
</b>                 I'm going out to the lake
                 tomorrow. Sandy wants to show-off
                 her dad's new boat. Why don't you
                 come?

<b>                               JACEY
</b>                 I have to work.

<b>                               ELEANOR
</b>                 Well, I guess you'll just have to
                 write me a letter.

<b>                               JACEY
</b>                 What do you mean?

<b>                               ELEANOR
</b>                 You said you wanted to talk to me
                 in private.

<b>                               JACEY

                 chance to be together, alone, you
                 know?

       STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and
       cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey
       handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being
       separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as
       he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.

       doesn't like back onto the platter. PAMELA ABBOTT steps
       over to Doug. She is his age (fifteen), the youngest of
       the Abbott girls, and the least stuck-up.

     Doug glances down at his tie and Pam flips her index
     finger up across the tip of his nose. Doug scowls and

     Doug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard.

               It's practically an arranged
               marriage. They think Alice has
               peanut shells for brains or
               something, so they sort of
               suggested that maybe it was time
               to tie the old knot and they sort
               of suggested that Peter was the
               one to do it with.

<b>12     INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)             12
</b>
     The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his
     wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has
     the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her
     smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a
     tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and
     sleep a bit too little.

<b>                             LLOYD
</b>               Ladies and Gentlemen -- I'd like
               to propose a toast in honor of our
               cause for celebration tonight --
               the engagement of our daughter,
               Alice, to Mister Peter
               Vanlaningham.

     He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER
     VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the
     prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three
     sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh
     family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the
     applause and AD-LIBBED toasts.

     The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and
     Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to
     Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto
     the dance floor.

       The guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither
       father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close
       quarters.

       The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the

       high society for tonight.

       Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential
       neighborhood) softly singing "You Ain't Nothin' but a
       Hound Dog." He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb,
       strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As
       he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see
       several trash cans on fire in the near distance.

       Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in
       the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds
       of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is
       playing "In Old Monterey"). Jacey stands in the shadows
       of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.

       -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.

</b>
       As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the
       garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge
       of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand
       still on the light fixture pull chain.

       Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of
       ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce
       competitors.

     Lloyd Abbott pulls his (1957) Cadillac up to the pumps.
     The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey. He wears a

     Jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the
     windshield. Lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash,
     climbs out of the car, and empties the ashtray in the

      He hands Jacey a five-spot and gets into his car. Lloyd
      drives away in his Cadillac. Jacey crumbles the five
      dollar bill into a ball. As he returns to the office he
      catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette
      machine. He frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie.

      The abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure
      situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. Doug
      strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over,
      holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. The

      disappears as the gas is consumed. VICTOR, Doug's

      male water skier. (Another young man is    driving the boat
      with two young women in bathing suits as   passengers.)

     around for the approach.

               Alice is going to have a baby.
               She and Kilroy didn't waste any
               time. He's already talking about
               having another, and Alice is up-
               chucking every hour on the hour.
               She's got morning-noon-and-night
               sickness. I've got the feeling
               she'll be barefoot and puking for
               years to come. Wallpaper patterns
               -- that's all she talks about.
               She and my mother spend hours
               looking at wallpaper pattern
               books. That's another thing I
               never think about... wallpaper.
                      (another beat)
               Well, I think this is called the
               silent treatment. I get enough of
               that from my father, I don't need
               it from you. Good luck at Penn.

     She starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and
     kisses her fiercely -- Eleanor responds with equal heat.
     They don't see Pamela enter the garage. Pam studies them
     for an imperturbable beat, then:

     Doug enters with the bowl and ice cream scoop in hand.
     He lifts the lid of the freezer, reaches for a carton of
     ice cream and something startles him. He cocks his head
     to listen and slowly lowers the freezer lid.

     He peers into the silvery, dim light and sees Jacey and
     Eleanor naked on an old daybed near the coal bin in the
     back of the garage. She is on top of Jacey, riding him
     rhythmically. Eleanor is facing Doug. She reacts without
     alarm or shame when she notices Doug staring at her. She
     coolly returns his stare. Doug tries, but he's unable to
     avert his eyes.

     bus carrying Jacey away to Philadelphia departs. Doug

<b>38     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY (SPRING, 1958)              38
</b>
     Doug steals lustful looks at Eleanor from behind his
     book. She is seated across the table from him. The
     library is filled with students poring over their
     assignments. Eleanor is seemingly oblivious to Doug's
     probing eyes.

     Doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table.
     He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his
     ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanor's skirt at the
     soft triangle that her white panties cover between her
     parted legs. Eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook
     paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "Hi
     Doug!"

     Doug starts with panic, rears back, cracks his head on
     the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds
     from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his
     chin with the sharp pencil. Doug scrambles up from under
     the table with the pencil dangling from his chin,
     knocking over his chair in the process. The tranquility
     of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted
     reactions of the students. Eleanor is momentarily
     concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but
     laugh, too.

     Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette,
     then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds
     perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers
     and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her
     reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with
     greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and
     massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her
     surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval.
     Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand
     under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the
     sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.

     Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a
     framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of
     family photos on the long table behind the sofa. It is
     Eleanor that he is thinking of -- in his mind's eye it is
     Eleanor's breast that he is fondling. Pamela pulls her
     lips from his:

         He kisses her with such ardor that she   interprets his
         answer to be yes, when in reality Doug   is only trying to
         silence her. He pulls his hand out of    her blouse and
         slips it under her skirt. Pam lurches    back into the

         at her with breathless confusion. She turns away from
         him and tries to button her blouse, but she can't see the
         buttons for her tears. She begins to sob and runs out of

     aware of him, but pretends that she isn't. Doug
     hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses
     his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. Pam's
     disappointment is plain to see.

     Doug doesn't notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends

     beside the Plymouth across the street. As Jacey starts
     across the street a CAR full of young women, including
     Eleanor and Sandy, HONKS, and stops beside him. Jacey

     baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand
     sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch.

               Go finish your homework.

     Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside.
     Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that
     Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a
     bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is
     not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with
     the sadness that is at the core of her being.

     A drab, four-door Chevrolet sedan with Wisconsin license
     plates speeds away from town.

     Incongruously, the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by
     an African-American DRIVER. There are two passengers in
     the back seat: a conservatively-dressed, middle-aged
     WOMAN and Eleanor Abbott. There is nothing telling about
     Eleanor's countenance, neither happiness nor sadness can
     be found on her face.

     the workmen erecting the party tent in the Abbott's front
     yard.

     The party is well underway, it's a younger crowd tonight.
     The band plays "Fly Me To The Moon." Doug stands apart
     from the others. He's ill-at-ease. His conversation
     with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the
     gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see
     things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a
     group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a
     reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age
     (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela
     dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the
     belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her
     beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses
     herself, and comes over to him.

<b>                             PAMELA

<b>                               DOUG

</b>               Yes, I am.    Come on, dance with

     She pulls him towards the dance floor.

</b>               You didn't tell me I had to dance.

<b>                             PAMELA

</b>               I accept your apology.   Let's
               dance.

     Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He
     feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and
     they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles:

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               Hi.

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               Hi.

     Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were
     children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for
     her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble
     of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as
     Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval
     is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor
     to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott.
     Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses
     the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the
     cause.

<b>                             PAMELA
</b>               Is Jacey home for the summer or is
               he just here for a visit?

     The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment
     sends a chill down Doug's spine.

               It's cheaper if he stays here for
               the summer. He can save more
               money for school, 'cause he
               doesn't have to pay rent. Money's
               tight, you know, we're sort of
               poor.

<b>                             PAMELA

</b>               Hell -- you kidding? Even with
               Jacey working summers, my mom had
               to borrow against the house so he
               could go to Penn. I don't know
               where the money'll come from for
               me to go to college.

     Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his
     dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells.

               saying something different -- she
               got knocked up, she ran away, your
               old man kicked her out. So, which
               is it?

     Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder.

<b>                              DOUG

     Ted is taken aback.   Pamela's eyes fill with tears.

</b>               Excuse me, asshole, but...

     Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him
     reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from
     Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks
     helplessly at Pamela:

     The hall light is on but the bedroom is dark. Doug lies
     on his bed (still dressed). Jacey appears in the
     doorway.

     Doug and Jacey play another hard fought game of ping-pong
     in the garage. In the midst of a volley Doug says:

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               I'm gonna go to Penn like you.

     Jacey snorts with incredulous laughter.

                 your ass.

       Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game
       with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter.
       Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the
       garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits
       it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots
       a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles:

       Doug looks up from the brochure and comes face-to-face
       with a mannequin wearing a bra, girdle, and stockings.
       He almost flinches with surprise and blushes profusely:

       It's snowing -- Doug paces to keep warm. He momentarily
       forgets the cold as he sees Pam and three of her girl
       friends come out of the drugstore across the street. The
       girls are in high spirits as they get into Pam's car.

       Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter
       Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out
       onto the sidewalk.

       The women pass by Helen with obvious reserve. Helen is
       seemingly unruffled by their distant responses. She
       observes Doug as he watches Pam and her friends drive
       off.

       Helen and Doug walk up sidewalk (towards the movie

       The commencement exercises are being held in the
       sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud
       parents and family members. Doug, hot and uncomfortable
       in his cap and gown, is seated among his fellow graduates
       behind the podium. The PRINCIPAL (at the podium)
       announces the names of the graduates as he calls them
       forward to receive their diplomas.

     Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma.

     Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan
     stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her
     restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan.

     Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes.

     Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her.
     The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her
     and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym.

     Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom.
     He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes
     settle on... Alice Abbott.

     Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old
     daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to
     Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle.

     Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she
     passes by with Susan in her arms.


<b>77     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY                77

     Commencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars
     slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating
     graduates, beaming parents, and rambunctious siblings.

     As Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly
     ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. She
     has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on.

     Helen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as
     they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between
     two parked vehicles. They are both caught off-guard --
     there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each
     other.

     They pass each other and head their separate ways.   Their
     chance meeting has not gone unobserved:

     Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of
     Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair
     her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips
     behind the wheel.

     And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door
     so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in
     the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around
     the car and gets in behind the wheel.

     Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare)
     and pulls out of his parking spot.

     This is torture for Jacey. Doug looks out the window at
     the striped tent in the Abbott's front yard as they pass
     by. A party for the "Class of 1959" is underway (as a
     banner on the tent proclaims). The street is lined with
     parked cars and busy with late-coming guests.

     Doug checks the rearview mirror for Jacey's reaction, but
     his brother keeps his eyes on the road.

               Lloyd's mother was a tough old
               bird. She sold eggs. They had a
               place way out on Ditch Road near
               County Line. That was ages ago.
               Poor Lloyd had to walk all that
               way in to school and then back
               everyday. Charlie used to call
               Lloyd 'Egg-head' and he didn't
               mean smart.

     Jacey and Doug sit on the porch steps eating bowls of ice
     cream. Helen rises from the porch swing and takes her
     empty bowl inside the house.

               everybody that I come from
               Hicksville, U.S.A. So if you're
               going to go to Philadelphia,

               get your own life? Stop being my
               fucking shadow.

     Doug digests Jacey's insult, then scoops a ball of ice
     cream out of his bowl with his spoon and flings the gooey
     ice cream into the side of Jacey's face. Doug rises and
     goes to the front door.

</b>               Missed me, peckerhead.

     As Doug opens the screen door Jacey dives into him --
     they fall into the porch swing with such force that its
     chains rip out of the porch ceiling and Doug, Jacey, and
     the swing go overboard off the end of the porch into the
     shrubs.

     A collection of GARBAGE CANS EXPLODE in all directions as
     Doug pops up from behind them and bolts down the
     driveway. Jacey chases after him, following him across
     the street. They pay no heed to Helen (in the b.g.)
     standing in their front yard, calling out to them:

     Doug jumps up onto a tall wooden fence. He gets halfway
     over when Jacey leaps up and grabs him and the fence
     collapses, dumping them into a back yard vegetable
     garden.

     Doug and Jacey wrestle and grapple in the muddy soil,
     cursing each other and crushing the rows of green crops.
     MRS. PORTER appears at her back door brandishing a broom.

     She sails into combat with her broom swinging. But Doug
     and Jacey are unwilling to give up the fight -- they are
     finally separated by a strong blast of water. They
     sputter for breath and discover that Helen is holding the
     hose.

     Helen sits in a lawn chair in the back yard wearing a
     large straw hat and reading a book. Doug and Jacey are
     repairing and painting the fence. Helen looks up from
     her book:

</b>               That board doesn't look straight,

     Doug and Jacey clean their hands with turpentine. Doug
     picks up a ping-pong paddle and bounces the ball on it,
     trying to see how long he can keep it bouncing. Jacey
     finishes cleaning up, picks up a paddle, and then,
     without a word, Doug serves the ball and they begin to
     volley.

     The Plymouth drives along the two-lane blacktop past the
     fields of tall, green corn. Doug is driving, Helen sits
     beside him. She reacts to something in the distance:

<b>                             HELEN
</b>               Isn't that Pamela Abbott?

     In the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries
     to remove a flat tire on her convertible.

     Doug grimaces as he recognizes her.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>               It is Pam.    Pull over.

     Doug reluctantly pulls over beside Pam's car. She's no
     more pleased to see Doug than he is to see her.

<b>                              HELEN

</b>               Well, maybe Doug can give you a

     Doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the Plymouth.

               This.

     Doug releases the load on the jack and strains to extract
     it from the molten pavement.

</b>               Pam, would you mind running Doug

     Helen slides over behind the wheel and drives away.

     Doug fumes silently while he reassembles the jack.

     Jacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner
     sipping an iced tea. He sees Alice Abbott enter -- she
     pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches
     the cash register near the front door. She calls out
     to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill.

     The waitress is too distracted to take notice of Alice

     behind her.

               hypocritical. It's insincere.
               People should do and say exactly

     Their conversation is stifled by this new standard of
     absolute honesty.

     The sunset provides a convenient excuse for their
     silence. But then Pam realizes he is staring at her.

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               Hi.

<b>                             DOUG
</b>               Yup.

     Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her
     index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you."
     Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she
     hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response -- she
     places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug
     leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for
     a long time. They will always remember this kiss.

     The movie has already begun. Alice enters the sparsely

     the darkness. A hand reaches out and takes her hand --
     it is Jacey. He's seated beside the door. He rises and

     screen for a few moments, then he moves his mouth to her
     ear and nibbles on her lobe. She turns her lips to his

      match. They are watching an episode of "Sea Hunt" on the

      She pushes harder against his feet and her foot slips off

      up.

         Pam's convertible barely comes to a halt at the curb
         before Jacey comes charging out of the house to Pam.
         Doug is occupied with the lawn mower; he doesn't notice
         Pam and Jacey at first. (Jacey and Pam have to speak
         over the din of the LAWN MOWER.)

         Jacey turns and dashes up the driveway.

         Doug watches Jacey jump into the Plymouth and speed down
         the driveway and then up the street.

         Doug SHUTS OFF the LAWN MOWER and walks over to Pam.

              and... well, some mornings I'd be
              crying before I even woke up.
              Then you were born. And Jacey
              just got lost in there. I didn't
              have anything for him. Mother
              took him over. He'd cry or call
              for me, and then I'd hear Mother
              answer him, and I'd go back to
              sleep.
                     (sighs bitterly)
              I should've taken us away from

<b>                            DOUG

<b>                            HELEN
</b>              After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott
              started dropping by on his way
              home from work. He felt so bad
              about that bet Charlie made with
              him at the lake. That foolish,
              idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt
              sorry for him. He'd have a cup of
              coffee with Mother and me. If a
              doorknob had come off he'd fix it.
              He'd carry the garbage cans to the
              curb. Someone dies, people try to
              be helpful. But he was by here so
              often that people started to talk.
              It was fairly obvious that he
              wanted something more from me than
              just a cup of coffee. I suggested
              that he didn't need to stop by
              here so often, but... then one
              afternoon I was at Woolworth's,
              having lunch at the counter. All
              of sudden Joan Abbott was standing
              there -- screaming and yelling at
              me to stop sleeping with her
              husband, with Lloyd. I was
              speechless. She was gone before I
              could find my tongue.

       Helen is overcome with tears. Doug stares at her

       A vintage, third-floor, railroad flat -- sparsely
       furnished and neat as a pin. Jacey is hosting a party.
       A TONY BENNETT record ("When Somebody Breaks Your Heart")
       plays on the hi-fi. The apartment is elbow-to-elbow with
       Penn men and attractive coeds from Radcliffe, Mt.
       Hollyoke, and Byrn Mawr. Doug sits in the middle of the
       sofa wedged between two coeds having separate, but
       equally animated conversations with two of Jacey's
       classmates (who are perched on the arms of the sofa).
       Doug wears a jacket and tie but his knack at looking out
       of place is intact.

       Jacey is apart from the others wooing a gorgeous CO-ED in
       a tight cashmere sweater.

      Jacey smiles and then kisses her. Doug is spying on them
      from the safety of the crowd. Jacey winks at Doug. Doug
      shakes his head in wonder.

      Doug is revising a set design -- deeply concentrating on
      his task. He's startled by a KNOCK on the door.

      Doug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on
      his face. He stops at the front desk and the student
      clerk points to another part of the lobby. Doug walks
      across the cavernous lobby and finds Pamela Abbott
      slumped in a chair.

<b>                              DOUG

      legs, but her panties start to slide off along with her
      pants.

</b>                 Everything's too screwed up.

       Doug kneels in front of her and anxiously tries to
       console her.

<b>                               DOUG
</b>                 No, no, it's not too late. It's
                 perfect timing. We're on our own
                 now. No Jacey and Eleanor or
                 Jacey and Alice. That's what
                 stinks about being the youngest,
                 we have to sweep up after
                 everybody else. But now it's just
                 us. It's our turn.

      Doug leads Pam by the hand down the aisle from the lobby.

<b>                              PAMELA

      He escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions
      her center stage near the footlights.

<b>                              DOUG
</b>                Just stand right there.

      He takes the work light with him as he walks off stage.
      Then with a METALLIC CLANK everything goes dark.

<b>                               PAMELA

</b>                It's all right -- don't move!
                Stay put.

      There's the RUMBLE and SQUEAK of a piece of SCENERY being
      rolled onto stage -- then the SWOOSH of a backdrop being
      lowered from the fly loft.

<b>                              DOUG (O.S.)
</b>                Almost, almost... hold on.

      We hear Doug RUNNING somewhere backstage then a beautiful
      sunset slowly illuminates the stage -- creating the
      perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that
      Doug has put into place: It is the roof of a weathered
      farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney.
      Doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick-
      change routine.

<b>                              PAMELA
</b>                Oh, Doug, it's beautiful.

                deal. So, there's this
                competition among all the theater
                design students to do the sets.
                And -- anyway -- I'm the one
                whose design got picked.

       goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft
       KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He
       opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her
       coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is

      lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face -- the impact
      knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has
      split open, he is blinded by blood.

      his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood.

       The second-grade students are in the midst of an art
       project where they make a design by gluing various sorts
       of dried beans to colored paper -- but the beans are
       being thrown about the room and other beans have been
       spilled on the floor. Helen wearily attempts to rein in
       the unruly children:

       Helen suddenly loses her energy and interest in policing
       the children. Their hijinks continue as she steps out of
       the classroom.

      Doug and Jacey enter from a door near the casket -- they

                Do me a favor. Don't stand here
                and wave good-bye... it makes me
                think of Mom.

</b>                Okay.   See you.

      Doug turns and walks away.   Jacey climbs onto the bus.

      Doug drives home from the bus depot in the old Plymouth.
      He slows as he sees... the party tent in the Abbotts'
      front yard (with its canvas sides rolled up).

      Susan's third birthday party is underway, dozens of well-
      dressed children and their parents are in attendance.
      Alice (who is very pregnant) and Peter Vanlaningham and
      Lloyd and Joan Abbott watch Susan riding her new pony, a
      gift from her grandparents. A new generation of Abbott
      parties has begun.


<b>171     EXT. HOLT HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY                                 171
</b>
      A "For Sale" sign has been placed on the front yard.
      Doug pulls up the driveway in the Plymouth. He turns OFF
      the ENGINE but doesn't get out of the car. Then he
      STARTS the CAR again and backs out of the driveway.

</b>
      Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old,
      this is very much a grown-up affair. The band is
      playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting
      from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while
      Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with
      his cronies. Doug enters the tent -- one-by-one the
      guests take notice of him as he works his way across the
      tent -- and all are very aware of his uninvited presence
      by the time he reaches Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd scrutinizes
      Doug, then:

<b>                              LLOYD
</b>                What do you want?

      Doug follows Lloyd into the dark-paneled room.

<b>                                 LLOYD
</b>                Shut the door.

      Doug closes the door.   Lloyd lights a cigarette.

<b>                                 LLOYD
</b>                Smoke?

<b>                                 DOUG
</b>                No thanks.

<b>                                 LLOYD
</b>                Sit down.

<b>                              DOUG
</b>                I don't want to.

<b>                              LLOYD
</b>                Then don't.
                       (slight beat)
                I'm sorry about your mother.

<b>                              DOUG
</b>                Sorry about what?

<b>                              LLOYD
</b>                You didn't know your mother at all
                if you think someone like me
                would've ever stood a chance with
                someone like her. That just goes
                to show you how stupid this town
                is -- that they'd believe she
                slept with me. That'd make
                Charlie laugh. Your old man was
                my best friend. He used to call
                me 'Egg-head' -- hell, everybody
                did. And back then everybody knew
                that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand
                a snowball's chance in hell with
                Helen Riley. Of course, that was
                all before I became Lloyd Abbott
                -- Mr. Abbott. That was back when
                I still had chicken shit on my
                shoes and twelve cents in my
                pocket. Charlie Holt was the only
                one good enough for Helen. I used
                to spy on 'em -- yup, I did.
                       (fixes a drink)
                Used to watch them sit on the
                front porch of her house -- your
                house -- and watch 'em talk.

                say to a girl. Never could just
                talk. Could dance, could listen
                to the radio. But I couldn't
                talk... except with your mother,
                except with Helen. I talked more
                to her after your dad died than
                I'd ever talked to any woman
                before then -- or since then.
                Jesus, I talked. Just like this.
                Just like right now. Just pouring
                out. Helen would listen and
                whatever I said, she'd never make
                me feel bad or ignorant or guilty.
                I mean... for Christ's sake, she
                never blamed me for what happened
                at the lake, for letting Charlie
                drive out on that ice. She never
                did anything but try to make me
                hurt less and I...

      Lloyd is startled by Joan as she opens the door.

<b>                              JOAN
</b>                Lloyd...?

                Goddammit, Joan, go way! Get the
                hell out of here! Leave me alone!

      He hurls his GLASS at her and it SHATTERS on the door
      jamb. Joan recoils in dumb-founded shock and backs out
      of the doorway. Lloyd fumes over and slams the door shut
      in her face. He leans against the door and catches his
      breath.

                I wanted sons and I got three
                daughters. I wanted a woman I
                could talk to and I got a woman
                whose ears are stuffed full of
                money and Percodan. But I got the
                chicken shit off my shoes.

                I know that's what Jacey thinks.
                I could always tell by the way he
                looked at me -- even when he was a
                little boy -- like I owed him
                something. But, goddammit, he's
                wrong. That bet was your father's
                idea and I never meant your mother
                any harm. I would've done
                anything for her -- anything. I
                loved her. But the only thing she
                ever wanted from me was just for
                me to leave her alone.

      He pours himself a fresh drink, then turns to Doug:

<b>                              LLOYD
</b>                So, what do you want?

      Doug navigates the busy sidewalk to the entrance of the
      building. He checks the number over the door to the
      address on the scrap of paper in his hand.


<b>175   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING DOORWAY - ELEANOR'S APARTMENT - 175

      Doug knocks on the door. Eleanor opens it, she's dressed
      for work in her stewardess uniform. She's obviously
      surprised to find Doug on her doorstep, but she greets
      him with a warm smile.

      Pamela dresses a mannequin in the display window. As she
      moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees
      Doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her
      from the sidewalk. Doug writes a message on the plate
      glass window with his index finger (printing the letters
      in reverse so that the message is legible from Pam's
      POV); his message reads: "I love you."

</b>                But... oh, Jesus... how do we
                start all over again?

      Pam's eyes fill with tears. Doug steps over to her and
      embraces her tenderly, holding her close.

<b>                               DOUG

      He wipes her tears from her cheeks with his fingers, then
      gives a short, but sweet, kiss. Then he smiles:
