<b>1       405 FREEWAY - LOS ANGELES - EARLY EVENING              1 
</b>
        Christmas tinsel on the light poles.  We ARE LOOKING east past
        Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly
        we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the
        noise is deafening.

<b>2       INT. 747 - PASSENGERS - SAME                           2 
</b>
        The usual moment just after landing when you let out that sigh
        of relief that you've made it in one piece.  As the plane TAXIS
        to its gate, they stir, gather personal belongings.

</b>
        mid-thirties, good-looking, athletic and tired from his trip.
        He sits by the window.  His relief on landing is subtle, but
        we NOTICE.  Suddenly, he hears --

<b>                                 SALESMAN'S VOICE
</b>                  You don't like flying, do you?

        McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.  Caught,
        he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear.

<b>                                 MCCLANE
</b>                  No, no, where'd you get that idea?

<b>                                 SALESMAN
</b>                         (smiling)
                  Ya wanna know the secret of successful
                  air travel?  After you get where you're
                  going, ya take off your shoes and socks.
                  Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot
                  and make fists with your toes.

<b>                                 MCCLANE
</b>                  Fists with your toes.

<b>                                 SALESMAN
</b>                  Maybe it's not a fist when it's your
                  toes...I mean like this...work out
                  that time zone tension.
                         (demonstrating)
                  Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot
                  shower for the old jet lag.  I know
                  it sounds crazy.  Trust me.  I've
                  been doing it for nine years.

        The plane stops.  Passengers rise, start to take down overhead
        luggage.  McClane does this, but as he opens the door above,
        the businessman BLANCHES seeing:

<b>3-A     HIS P.O.V. - MCCLANE'S BARETTA PISTOL                  3-A 
</b>
        Peeking out from his jacket.

<b>3-B     BACK TO SCENE                                          3-B 
</b>
        Recognizing the look, McClane smiles reassuringly.

<b>                                 MCCLANE
</b>                  It's okay.
                         (showing badge)
                  I'm a cop.
                         (pause)
                  Trust me.  I've been doing it for
                  eleven.

        The businessman relaxes, moves off.  McClane now wrestles down
        the biggest Teddy Bear FAO Schwartz had to offer.  Balancing
        this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out a topcoat
        and an overnighter.  Barely managing all this, he turns,
<b>        COLLIDING WITH:
</b>
<b>3-C     A PRETTY STEWARDESS                                    3-C

        She bumps noses with the bear, gives a look.

<b>                                 STEWARDESS
</b>                         (smiling, about the bear)
                  Maybe you should have bought her a
                  ticket.

<b>                                 MCCLANE
</b>                  Her?

        He scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear, shrugs.

<b>                                 MCCLANE
</b>                  She doesn't complain.

<b>                                 STEWARDESS
</b>                         (eying him)
                  Neither would I.

        McClane smiles, with just enough of a sigh to know he's as
        wistful about things-that-might-have-been as she is...moves
        down the aisle.

<b>4       INT. THE NAKATOMI BUILDING (LOS ANGELES) - EVENING     4 
</b>
        CLOSE ON A bottle of Dom Perignon as the cork explodes across
        a large office floor decorated for Christmas.  A Japanese man,
        mid-fifties standing on a desk holds up the bottle triumphantly
        and looks out at an adoring audience of junior executives and
        office personnel.  He is JOSEPH TAKAGI, Sr V.P. of Sales for
        Nakatomi, a multinational corporation.

<b>                                 TAKAGI
</b>                  Ladies and gentlemen...I congratulate
                  each and every one of you for making
                  this one of the greatest days in the
                  history of the Nakatomi corporation...

        In the b.g., obviously still at work, an attractive BUSINESSWOMAN
        in her mid-thirties, studying a computer printout, heads toward
        her office.  Falling into step with her is HARRY ELLIS,
        thirty-seven, V.P. of Sales.  Well-dressed, with stylish,
        slicked-back hair, he looks and acts very smooth.

<b>                                 ELLIS
</b>                  What about dinner?

                  Stockings...chestnuts...Rudolph and
                  Frosty...those things ring a bell?

        She turns into:

<b>5       HER OFFICE                                             5 
</b>
        Her name is HOLLY GENNARO MCCLANE, though the nameplate on her
        door stops after the first two.  She puts the printout down
        on her secretary's desk.

<b>                                 ELLIS
</b>                         (in reply)
                  I was thinking more of roaring
                  fireplaces...mulled wine and a nice
                  brie...

        Holly ignores the come-on, turns to her secretary.

<b>                                 HOLLY
</b>                  Ginny, it's 6:40, you're making me
                  feel like Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Go on,
                  join the party, have some champagne.

        Ginny slowly manipulates herself out of her seat.  She is
        enormously pregnant.

                  Do you think the baby can handle
                  a little sip?

<b>                                 HOLLY
</b>                         (eyeing her)

                  How about tomorrow night?

        Holly just points to the door.  He follows Ginny out, clearly
        not giving up.  Just then the party on Holly's phone picks up
        and we:

        where a five-year old LUCY MCCLANE races her YOUNGER BROTHER
        to the phone, winsthe wrestling match, and answers with a sense
        of importance.  An Xmas tree is in the b.g.

                  speaking.

        Holly suddenly smiles.  It is the first time we've seen her
        smile and it speaks volumes about the person hidden under a
        tough business exterior.

<b>                                 HOLLY

                  mother.

        She looks up and watches Ellis leave.  He "shoots" her with a
        "catch ya later" wink.

        Lucy hands the phone to a young Salvadorian woman, PAULINA,

        McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest
        stuffed animal FAO Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag,
        comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal.
        He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an
        act which drives him into another fender bender with a CUTE
        GIRL who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma.  As she
        smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear
        and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend.

        FAMILY REUNIONS are going on all around his as grandparents
        greet grown children and their children, YOUNG WIVES greet
        uniformed SOLDIERS, our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant
        wife and two pleasant kids.  It's all very traditional, very
        touching and not the least bit corny.

        McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the
        waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting.
        Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, ARGYLE, in an
        ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform.  As he waits he beats out a
        rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with J. McCLANE written
        on it in magic marker.  McClane pauses in front of him, unsure.

        Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat.

        gives up, looks out the window.

        TILT DOWN FROM one of the stars of this film, the well-lit,
        impressive and spanking-new NAKATOMI BUILDING.  The limo pulls
        up, parks, and Argyle gets out.  McClane lets himself out,
        which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to
        do it.  They both go to the rear of the vehicle.

        Argyle climbs out of the limo and stops by the trunk.

</b>                  I'll find someplace.

        He looks up at the highrise lit by huge spotlights, then
        back at Argyle who's made no attempt to open the trunk.

<b>                                 ARGYLE

        Beautiful and -- on first glance -- deserted.  Finally a
        SOUND in the sterile lobby reveals the presence of a
        SECURITY GUARD hidden until now behind a massive desk.
        McClane goes there, signs in.

<b>                                 MCCLANE
</b>                  Holly McClane?

        The Guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console.

<b>                                 GUARD
</b>                  Just type it in there.

        McClane is confused for a moment, then he moves to the screen.
        He gives the Guard a look...the Guard raises his eyebrows as
        if to say give it a try.

        McClane types, "McClane, Holly".  Pause.  The screen replies,

        Frowns...thinks.  Simultaneously inspired and suspicious, he
        types again.

        McClane types, GENNERO, HOLLY.  This time the screen CHANGES,
        shows an elevation of the building and then a floor plan of the
        30th floor with Holly's office BLINKING.                      *

                  Take the express elevator and get
                  off at the noise.

        McClane nods, moves off.  He moves to the elevators, and as he
        does his experienced eye takes in:

<b>13-E    ANOTHER SECURITY GUARD                                 13-E

<b>                                 MCCLANE
</b>                  Lots of hardware...

        The guard shrugs.  McClane gets in the elevator.

        McClane hits "30" and REACTS to the hyper-powered SPEED with
        which he rises.  He rotates his head, getting out the travel
        cricks.

        As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING,
        THROBBING NOISE.  McClane stops and listens before he
        realizes -- it's the party.  As the doors open the noise
        ATTACKS us.

<b>15      30TH FLOOR - SAME                                      15

        McClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually
        spiraling inward.  He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch
        from a passing tray, sips...scowls.  Spotting open beers in
        an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even
        burying the plastic glass.  Sipping the beer, he moves through
        the dense party.  People he doesn't know throw streamers over
        him.

        A WOMAN kisses him.  He grins.  A MAN kisses him.

                         his head)
                  California...

        Finally he queries a DANCING WOMAN.  The MUSIC drowns out their
        words but she nods, points off in some generic direction.

        McClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses
        his bearings.  He sees:

        Takagi smiles, leads the way.  As they approach Holly's office
        door, McClane notices the name there is -- again -- "Gennero".

        A moment.  Does the sound of the party stop for him?  We know
        it.  For her?  It's more cryptic.  We sure hope so.

                 A little token of our appreciation
                 for all her work.

        the wrist away from Ellis, looks at the watch.

         Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the
         door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty
         retreat.  The interruption temporarily dents the mood.  Holly
         tries to smile.  But for McClane it's the last frustration.

         There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to
         say...something but he sets his jaw, says nothing.  Just then

        only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the
        building and two extremely well-dressed BUSINESSMAN (late

        lights up a new Marlboro, dials a number on the (bathroom)

        stands in front of an intimidating matrix of phone lines -- but
        what he has in mind won't require a doctorate in Electrical
        Engineering.  Karl comes over, gives his an elder brother's
        punch on the arm, points out what to do.  Together they focus
        on four CPV plastic conduits which run out of the main panel
        over their heads.  Tony nods.  Opens a case REVEALING a

        Two terrorists, FRANCE and FRITZ, armed with M-5 machine guns
        searching the offices on the hall one by one.  They open a door,
        look in from the hallway, and move on quickly to the next.

        They are four offices away and moving fast.

        McClane looks across the corridor and sees the stairwell door
        -- too far to reach without being seen.

        Franco and Fritz reach the office just before Ellis' and throw
        open the door REVEALING the man and woman who interrupted Holly
        and McClane a few minutes before, now in the throes of
        passionate lovemaking on the desk.  The two terrorists smile
        at each other, then enter the office.

        A moment later the man, (trying desperately to pull up his
        pants) and the woman (buttoning her blouse) are pushed out
        into the hall and toward the larger group by Fritz.  The other
        terrorist, Franco, goes to Ellis' office and opens the door.

        It is...empty.

        This is the mezzanine floor immediately above the main
        Nakatomi lobby.  McClane sees Theo and KRISTOFF wheeling carts
        of equipment.  McClane ducks back into the stairwell, he runs
        up another flight and out onto:

        Eventually it will be one large secretarial pool, but only a
        portion is completed.  Half-finished partitions and office
        furniture in its original plastic wrappings are everywhere.
        One end has a few lonely finished working areas.

        A high-rise apartment building a half-block away sparkles with
        lights.  McClane stares at a PRETTY GIRL in her bedroom.  She's
        wearing drop dead underwear right out of the Victoria's Secret
        catalog.  As we watch, she flops down on her bed, and with
        one long leg in the air, effortlessly dials

        She looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on
        this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward.
        Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her

        As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly.
        He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her
        hand "reassuringly."

        Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He
        reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he
        comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks

        executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.

        Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels
        his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it
        back into his coat pocket.

        His look drops to the wall and focuses on a small red fire alarm
        switch by the door.

        McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance
        he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto
        Avenue of the Stars.

        Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the
        second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and
        turn down separate side streets, heading for home.

        Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS
        OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine
        gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he
        reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire
        floor.  McClane is gone.

        The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane
        Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series
        of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path
        if he can make it past Tony.

<b>                                TONY

                        of his machine gun)
                 I promise not to hurt you.

        Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then
        around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As
        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another
        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near
        the cubicles.

        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past
        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches
        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the
        partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle.

        grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not
        realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane,
        steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel
        against Tony's temple.

        calmly.

        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony
        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.

        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the
        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends
        his pistol into the hall.

        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.

        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that
        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they
        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen
        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash
        into:

        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.
        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto
        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly
        to the side.

        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,
        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets
        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very
        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on
        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND
        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.

        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.

        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during
        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.

        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the
        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's
        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take
        a couple of steps.

        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking
        the boots off.

        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then
        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.
        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:

        chair into the elevator.  (NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)
        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and
        30th floors.

        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden
        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.

        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's
        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with
        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.

        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the
        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and
        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof
        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the
        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting
        the car in motion again.

        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center
        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are
        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny
        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.
        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern
        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.

        gun held ready.  His jaw drop as he sees:

        As Fritz stands there, confused, Hans comes to the elevator with
        Franco, lifts Tony's chin and sees that his neck has been
        snapped.  He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar,
        takes it out.

        McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him.
        CAMERA ADJUSTS from Fritz in the b.g. to Hans and France just
        below.

        McClane is WRITING in his weather-beaten cop's notebook.  The
        first notation is NUMBER OF HOSTAGES:  HOLLY + 30 -- odd.  Then
        it says, NUMBER OF TERRORISTS?  As we watch, he adds "3 ? 1
87-H    in Lobby (?) and 2+ with hostages??  Plus ones on     87-H  
        roof (3)."

                 Yes...we have to tell Karl his brother
                 is dead.  Tell him to come down.

        Now McClane writes "HANS=LEADER.  Karl=BROTHER.  USE THIS?"
        As Fritz calls Karl on his CB, Hans looks at Franco.

<b>                                HANS
</b>                 Franco, you and Fritz take the body

        On top of the car, listening to the conversation below.  Franco
        and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close.
        The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy,
        grease-coated cables to keep his balance.  Already his clothes
        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the
        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car
        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the
        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the
        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.

        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.

        pulls himself up onto it.  As he moves along the catwalk looking
        for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'.  McClane
        pushes it open and looks in.

        takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel.
        Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we
        HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't
        have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop.

        He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder
        leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door
        McClane enters a darkened:

        TIGHT as one after another after another HOSTESS TWINKIE is
        stacked up on the counter.  CAMERA WIDENS and we SEE the
        young male CLERK, who stifles a smile.  Another teenage
        employee behind the counter also smothers a laugh.

        The customer is POWELL, young for a police veteran, old for
        the rest of the world.

<b>                                CLERK

                 the company.

        The Clerk nods and puts them in a bag.  As Powell pays, suddenly
        his BELT RADIO crackles to life.

        Powell grabs the radio, speaks into it.

        He moves to the door, steps outside.

        Powell looks towards the horizon and up.

        There it is, Nakatomi, in all its gleaming glory.

        Powell is already moving to the car.  He tosses in the twinkies,

        And he BURNS RUBBER leaving the store:

        running for his life, from Fritz and Franco, doesn't realize
        he is being herded around the building toward Karl.  Suddenly
        McClane turns a corner and sees Karl.  The big man fires a
        burst and McClane ducks back stopping at the exterior door
        to the pump room he used before.  It is locked from the inside.

        He BLOWS the lock off with a burst from his machine gun and
        slips into the darkness of the:

<b>109     ELEVATOR SHAFT NEAR PUMP ROOM                         109  
</b>
        Coming quickly out of the pump room, McClane picks his way
        over the same ground as a few minutes before and opens the door
        to the elevator shaft.  The dimly lit shaft yawns before him.
        He starts down the ladder back to the catwalk, moves along
        it -- STOPS.

        The catwalk ends, and the elevator is gone.

        Karl crosses, starts to open the door to the elevator shaft
        when suddenly their radio crackles with --

                 Karl, I know you want him, but the

                 Maybe we can convince them it was all
                 a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots!
                 If you lock him in he'll be neutralized
                 -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!

        Karl turns off his radio.  In the light of their flashlights,
        the two other terrorists look at Karl in stunned disbelief.
        He opens the door to the elevator shaft.

        He's OVERHEARD enough of this to realize he's in deep shit.
        He backtracks to the air shaft door, strikes a cigarette
        lighter.

        Karl steps off the ladder to the catwalk, his own gun held    *  
        ready.

        HEARING Karl's approach, McClane thinks fast, looks down at
        his narrow confines, and then at:

<b>118-A   HIS WEAPON                                            118-A

        and its canvas gunsling and metal strap slides.

<b>118-B   BACK TO SCENE                                         118-B  
</b>
        Quickly, McClane lets out all the slack in the sling.  Then,
        he BRACES the weapon across the outside opening of the air
        shaft door and lowers himself into the:

<b>119     AIR SHAFT                                             119  
</b>
        meanwhile holding onto the canvas sling with his elbows bent
        over it like a kid doing a half-asses skin-the-cat on a swing
        set.

        His feet slowly move down the smooth aluminum walls until they
        reach the top of the air duct, then DANGLE in the open space.
        He straightens his arms to give him length enough to touch
        the bottom edge of the duct.

        Suddenly he FEELS something GIVE above him and looks up.

<b>120     CLOSE ON THE SLING                                    120

        It was designed to carry a gun on a man, not vice versa.  The
        few inches of extra canvas are sliding through the clips.
        When they're gone...he will be too.

<b>121     KARL                                                  121

        He moves silently toward the corner.

        now only inches from the bottom edge.  McClane's arms are
        fully extended now.  He hears Karl on the metal catwalk.  His
        muscles strain and quiver.

<b>123     THE SLING                                             123

        One of the canvas end slips through the clip.

        FALLING.  He grabs the ledge of the air duct as he falls and
        his body slams into the aluminum wall with an echoing BOOM.
        Above him on the catwalk the rifle rattles on the metal outside
        the door.

<b>125     ON KARL                                               125

        Around the corner Karl FREEZES, unsure of the sound:

<b>126     ON MCCLANE                                            126

        holding onto the ledge by his hands.  With every ounce of
        strength he tries to pull himself up into the horizontal duct,
        clawing for a hold.

<b>127     ON KARL                                               127

        He rounds the corner and sees McClane's rifle lying beneath
        the doorway.  He moves to the small door, shines his light and
        aims his rifle down into the air shaft ready to fire.

<b>128     HIS P.O.V.                                            128

        The shaft is deserted.  Moving his light around he sees the air
        duct.  Without hesitation he turns and backtracks to the pump
        room door.

        He lies exhausted and motionless in the narrow crawl space.  He
        awkwardly fishes out the lighter from his shirt pocket and
        thumbs it ON.

        The flickering GLOW shows him this ain't no place for
        claustrophobics -- it's a long, long long dark and narrow
        corridor full of weird shadows.  The far end (if there even
        if one?) is BLACK.

        The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit,
        Karl leading the way through the door.  Karl points quickly to
        the left and right where there are a series of rooms.  The
        others checks these while Karl approaches the CAMERA, trigger
        finger ITCHING.  Almost immediately, the others return.

                 Nothing.

        Karl looks puzzled.  Then he thinks, mentally retracing McClane's
        few options.  Karl's eyes scan the architecture here, and then
        suddenly he looks UP.

        McClane remains motionless in the air duct.  Three quarter-size
        holes inches from his face show how close Karl came to nailing
        him.  Sweat covers his face, drips silently onto the aluminum.

        Karl hesitates a moment, fighting his instincts before finally
        turning to go.  Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly
        under his weight.  Karl stops and looks up at the matrix of
        aluminum duct work, trying to single out the source of the
        sound.  He steps back into the room and raises his rifle.
        Holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly
        of McClane's air duct, feeling for weight -- the weight of a
        body.

        McClane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the
        aluminum fifteen feet away.  There is a pause and another
        three feet closer.  He can hear Karl's footsteps on the
        concrete -- moving slowly below the duct.

        His eyes are fixed above him on the air duct.  He presses the

        Silently he moves his hand, slowly draws his Beretta.  The

        gun downward and waits.

        touches the duct under McClane when Franco returns to the

        scans the premises.  In the lobby we SEE Eddie, sitting behind

        They move quickly toward the windows on the Avenue of the Stars
        side where a terrorist, ALEXANDER, with a BAR rifle has set up
        a machine gun nest under a half-opened window.  Directly below
        him we SEE Powell's car.

        McClane draws the chair back for the final hit when a terrorist
        (MARCO) appears at the door.  Both men react, but Marco already
        has his gun up.  He FIRES a round at McClane.  The bullets rip
        into the table top and the chair, and McClane goes down behind
        the table.

        beneath the table and sees:

        Suddenly a barrage of MACHINE GUN FIRE from Alexander on the
        third floor drowns out his call!  Powell ducks and flattens
        against the seat as bullets blow out the front window,
        covering him in glass.

        But Powell accelerates in reverse away from the building,
        keeping his head low and praying he doesn't hit anything
        as the bullets follow him, digging into asphalt.  A half block
        away his car runs off the pavement and down a SLOPE, finally
        BOUNCING to a jarring HALT in a parking lot which is destined
        to become police H.Q. a few pages from now.  Powell sits up
        and clutches the mike.

                 BZZZ!  Sorry, Hans, wrong guess.
                 Would you like to go for
                 Double Jeopardy, where the stakes

                 change?

        He rolls Heinrich over and is delighted to find a pack of
        Gauloise's in the man's pocket.  He takes them, pats the      *

        McClane STOPS in mid-speech.  He's just opened the kit bag
        Heinrich had over his shoulder when he died.  Now McClane
        takes out the contents...dozens and dozens of EXPLOSIVE

        SMILES at the tell-tale STATIC as Hans goes off and on.  He
        knows what's happening.  Now, he starts to walk down

        The service elevator arrives on the 3rd floor and James and
        Alexander move across the room toward the windows with the
        anti-tank weapon.  At the window, they prepare the weapon
        for use.

        Outside the window the armored car has stopped in front of the
        wounded man and paramedics quickly load them in from the
        sheltered side of the vehicle.  Alexander quickly sights on
        the armored car.

        A blast ROARS from the third floor window and the shell hits
        the armored car.  The car pitches forward like a beast whose
        front legs have been shot out from under it -- its front axle
        destroyed, unable to move.  Alexander looks back at James and
        grins.

        of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers
        the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to
        share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and
        Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.

        BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS

        from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out

        They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see
        a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP
        behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,
        unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs.
        He looks over the edge, hesitates:

        DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the
        side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The
        shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS
        sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the
        building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his
        arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in:

        McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls
        onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally
        he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee:

        CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window,
        he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the
        weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his
        already wounded foot keeps him indoors.

        He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free
        just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond!

        for:

        recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is

        and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath

        He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.
        Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to
        the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.
        Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a
        tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:

<b>386     MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                          386
</b>
        At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta
        from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS
        Hans high in the chest!

        The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind
        him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is
        happening, McClane SPINS:

<b>387     EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS             387
</b>
        Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.

<b>388     BACK TO SCENE                                         388
</b>
        Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood
        in shock.

<b>389     MCCLANE                                               389
</b>
<b>                                MCCLANE
</b>                 You were right about us Americans.
                        (he blows smoke
                        from his pistol
                        barrel)
                 We are cowboys.

<b>390     VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                    390
</b>
        Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and
        disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to
        TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward
        place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:

<b>391     HOLLY'S WRIST                                         391
</b>
        and she is YANKED off her feet!

<b>392     BACK TO SCENE                                         392
</b>
        Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane
        LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the
        last minute!

<b>393     EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                             393
</b>
        The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the
        window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto
        Holly as Hans drags her out!

        McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to
        pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with
        her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins
        to INCH towards Holly's wristband.

<b>394     HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                    394
</b>
        A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood
        flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand
        to bring up the gun he is still holding!

<b>395     MCCLANE                                               395
</b>
        Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one
        last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:

<b>396     VERY CLOSE                                            396
</b>
        McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed
        metal SNAPS, links flying:

<b>397     WIDER                                                 397
</b>
        Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch
        suddenly drop.

        We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.

        McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.

<b>                                MCCLANE
</b>                 It's okay, babe.  It's okay.

        He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband
        he's still holding.

<b>                                MCCLANE
</b>                 You got a warranty on this?

        She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.

        Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.
        Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.

<b>399     CLOSER                                                399
</b>
        A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We
        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by
        SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane
        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into
        the crowd.

<b>                                MCCLANE
</b>                        (calling out)
                 Al?  Al, you here -- ?

        The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and
        McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet
        apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.  But
        somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other
        like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,
        is the truth.

<b>                                MCCLANE
</b>                        (emotional)
                 Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I
                 couldn't have made it without you.

<b>                                POWELL
</b>                 Bullshit.

<b>                                MCCLANE
</b>                 I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife...
                 Holly Gennero.

<b>                                HOLLY
</b>                        (taking Powell's hand,
                        correcting)
                 Holly McClane.

        Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.                 *

<b>                                POWELL
</b>                        (to her)
                 A pleasure.  I guess John doesn't
                 need me to give you that message
                 anymore.

<b>                                HOLLY
</b>                        (puzzled)
                 Message?

        McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's
        direction.

<b>                                POWELL
</b>                 You know, about him being such a
                 jerk -- and how he's really sor --
                        (seeing McClane)
                 -- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill
                 you in.

        Just then Robinson barges forward.

<b>                                ROBINSON
</b>                 I want you for debrief, McClane.
                 You've got some things to answer
                 for -- Ellis' murder -- property
                 damage -- interfering with police                    *
                 business --

        A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.

<b>400     HIS P.O.V.                                            400
</b>
        There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.
        Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his
        machine gun.

<b>401     EXT. BUILDING                                         401
</b>
        As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with
        McClane and levels his gun.  McClane throws Holly to the
        ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinson's sidearm.

        But he doesn't get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl --
        knocking him back through the doorway.  McClane looks back to
        see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his .38.

        His hand is rock steady.  He sees McClane's look.

<b>                                POWELL
</b>                        (shrugging)
                 You were right.  You couldn't have
                 made it without me.

        They smile.  Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan
        onto them.  Thornburg pushes his way forward, mike extended
        like a weapon.

<b>                                THORNBURG
</b>                 Mr. McClane...Mrs. McClane...any

                 What are your feelings now that it's
                 all over?

        Without a beat, Holly PUNCHES HIM in the chops.  He FALLS,
        dropping the mike with an electronic SQUEAL.  McClane looks at
        his wife, amazed.  Behind them, Thornburg sits on the ground, *
        nurses his lip, turns to his camerman.

<b>                                THORNBURG

                 Did you get that?

        McClane and Holly continue on, turn towards:                  *

<b>402     ARGYLE'S LIMO                                         402

        It's a little smashed up, but still running.  Argyle is
        standing beside the open door.  McClane and Holly get in and
        Argyle closes the door.

<b>                                ARGYLE

                 If this is their idea of Christmas
                 I gotta be there for New Year's.

        CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW the read window where McClane and
        Holly are kissing.  As they drive off, we:
