</b>               He stands at the foot of the bed, a man in his mid-twenties,

               bottoms and a Mostly Mozart T-shirt.

               chant.
<b>          
</b>               Steven holds his arms parallel to the floor. Slowly he begins
               to turn, clockwise. The beat picks up and he whirls more
               quickly, his mouth coming open.
<b>          
</b>               Now he begins to whirl about the room. The chanting grows in
               intensity. Although he is blindfolded, Steve deftly avoids
               running into furniture and other objects.
<b>

               away, leaving a hole in the floor. Brownish water drips from
               the tap into the wash basin, which is indelibly stained. The

                         always unfair. Why do you think I
                         live this way? Hiding out. Stealing
                         electricity from a lamp post.
                         Because people who write the truth
                         are outcasts of society. I can't
                         live openly, in a nice clean
                         doorman building, with my name on

          the shadows, his gun lowered. Oddly, he seems distracted by

          TV set on the counter.

                    games a year. All by myself. I was
                    one of those kids with scabby
                    elbows. I called out to the

                    crumples up and dies. I wait for

                    pitch by pitch, inning by inning.
