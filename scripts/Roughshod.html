<b>               EXT. DESERT - DAWN
</b>
               FULL SHOT. The sun, spinning up from behind the dark rim of 
               eastern hills, is bleaching the cloudless, morning sky. This 
               is volcanic country, barren, desolate, forbidding. There is 
               no sign of life, no sound. Then on a distant hill, a man 
               appears, to be followed by two others. They walk steadily 
               forward.

<b>               EXT. NARROW CANYON - DAWN
</b>
               MED. SHOT. A dry watercourse threads its way through the cut 
               in the treeless hills. The sun is not high enough as yet to 
               drive night from the canyon. A man appears around a bend; 
               another and still another. They are McCall, Peters and Lednov, 
               clad in prison clothes, hatless, their heads closely cropped. 
               As Lednov's face comes into a closeup,

<b>               EXT. HILL - DAWN
</b>
               LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. A narrow valley lies below. Through 
               it runs a cottonwood-bordered stream. Smoke curls up out of 
               the trees. Horses graze in a small meadow near the creek. 
               From O.O. comes the SOUND of heavy boots crunching across 
               the dry, eroded earth. The three men file past camera to 
               stop in the immediate F.g. and look down into the valley. 
               They exchange glances and start down.

</b>
<b>               EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN
</b>
               MED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH willows. A bearded man, Cal 
               Forster, and two young fellows in their late teens squat 
               beside a campfire eating breakfast. O.s. there is the SOUND 
               of movement. Lednov moves cautiously into the scene. He has 
               a revolver in his hand.

               Forster turns toward camera and fear comes into his 
               expression. Lednov fires. Forster crumples near the fire. 
               The two boys jump to their feet and reach for rifles. Lednov 
               fires again and again. McCall and Peters come into the scene, 
               both firing revolvers.

<b>               EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN
</b>
               MED SHOT - ANGLED ACROSS campfire. On the fire smoulders the 
               prison clothes the convicts had worn. Smoke spirals up. In 
               the B.B. Lednov, Peters and McCall, now wearing the clothes 
               of the three Forsters, saddle the horses. CAMERA PANS AROUND 
               and ANGLES DOWN. The bodies of Forster and his sons, now 
               clad in underwear are sprawled by the fire. Forster's arm 
               lies close to the smouldering clothing.

</b>
<b>               EXT. CREEK - DAWN
</b>
               MED. LONG SHOT. Smoke climbs above the trees. Into the 
               clearing ride the three convicts, to cross it and move 
               westward. They disappear over the hill. A dust cloud marks 
               their passage. CAMERA HOLDS ON the scene and over the shot 
               comes the MAIN TITLE CARD:

<b>               EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
</b>
               LONG SHOT. A buckboard drawn by two horses comes along the 
               road. Graham, a middle-aged rancher, is driving. As the horses 
               trot forward and dust rises above the road, the NEXT TITLE 
               CARD is shown.

<b>                                                                   DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>               EXT. CREEK - DAY
</b>
               LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Graham's buckboard moves down the 
               road toward the clearing, as the TITLE CARDS follow and 
               change. When the buckboard reaches the creek, the LAST TITLE 
               CARD is ended.

<b>               EXT. MEADOW - DAY
</b>
               MED. SHOT. Graham drives the horses through the creek and 
               into the meadow. Through the trees the Forster camp can be 
               seen. Graham glances over, then suddenly pulls on the reins. 
               As the horses stop, he twists the reins around the whip stock, 
               grabs his rifle from under the seat, leaps out and hurries 
               forward toward the camp.

<b>               EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAY
</b>
               MED. SHOT. Graham hurries through the trees to stop in horror 
               near the dead men. Then very slowly he moves forward to the 
               smouldering fire. Stooping he lifts Forster's arm away from 
               the fire, then picks up one of the prison coats and looks at 
               it.

<b>                                                                   DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>               EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
</b>
               MED. LONG SHOT. The surrounding hills are covered with scrub 
               pinon pine and mesquite. Graham's buckboard, moving slowly 
               up a hill, passes camera, which PANS WITH it. In the bed, 
               covered by a tarp, are the three bodies. The narrow, one-way 
               road climbs easily up the gentle hill. Beyond, a dust cloud 
               rises. As Graham's buckboard nears the crest, a surrey appears 
               and starts down. Graham pulls his team into the bank, trying 
               to make room for the surrey.

<b>               MED. SHOT
</b>
               There are four women in the two-seated surrey, which is 
               heavily loaded with trunks, hatboxes, etc. Mary Wells, the 
               loveliest of the four, is driving. She is more poised, more 
               self-assured than the others. Her clothes, though a trifle 
               showy, are attractive. She wears a large spectacular hat. 
               Helen Carter, showier, harder and more cynical, sits beside 
               her. In the seat behind are Marcia Paine, placid, younger 
               looking than her years, and Elaine Ross, a striking blonde 
               with a pale haunted face. Elaine is obviously ill. Mary is 
               riding the brake and holding the team back.

               SHOOTING PAST Graham.

                         What in thunderation --
                              (calling)
                         Wait a minute -- stop --

               He jerks on the reins and tries to make room for the surrey. 
               A steep bank is on camera left. On camera right, the road 
               drops off into a gulley. As the surrey comes up Mary reins 
               the team in. The women all look frightened. Graham, trying 
               to force his team to pull the vehicle up the bank, is too 
               occupied to recognize the women at once. Having made just 
               enough room for the surrey, he turns and looks at the women.

                              (then surprised)
                         What are you girls doin' way out 
                         here?

               Mary looks ahead at the narrow road and the canyon to her 
               left.

                         to Sonora.

</b>                         What do you know about that. Did you 
                         sell your place?

                         Not exactly. They decided gambling 
                         and dancing were bad for people.
                              (pointing)
                         Can I make it?

<b>                                     GRAHAM
</b>                         Depends on how good you drive.

</b>                         She's a little out of practice.

               Graham jumps over the wheel.

<b>               MED. CLOSE ON SURREY
</b>
               Graham reaches the surrey.

                         I'm slidin' all the way over.

               She climbs out. Marcia looks at the narrow space ahead.

                         So am I. Come on Elaine.

               Elaine leans back against the cushions and shakes her head.

                         What's the difference if we fall in 
                         the canyon.

</b>                         Don't talk like that.

               Helen is out on the road now. Mary has moved over and Graham 
               picks up the reins. Marcia gives up and jumps out.

<b>                                     GRAHAM
</b>                         Nothin' to it --

               He releases the brake.

<b>                                     GRAHAM
</b>                         -- once you know how. Trouble is, 
                         never was a woman knew how to handle 
                         a team. Shouldn't let 'em loose on 
                         the roads. No disrespect meant, Miss 
                         Wells.

               Mary isn't listening. She is looking at the road. Elaine 
               closes her eyes. Helen and Marcia scurry back out of the 
               way.

<b>                                     GRAHAM

               Adroitly he drives the surrey past.

               featuring buckboard. Helen and Marcia start along the road 
               past the buckboard. Helen stops and looks at its cargo in 
               horror. She grabs Marcia's arm. The girls look at each other 
               and hurry after the surrey which has stopped below the 
               buckboard.

                         around and drive right back to Aspen.

               The women exchange glances. Elaine is sitting up, her eyes 
               open.

                         Like I said if I was you, I'd go 
                         back, because the men who killed 
                         them might be on this road.

                         from.

               As Mary speaks, Helen pushes Marcia into the surrey and climbs 
               up beside Mary.

</b>                         We tried to point that out. But there 
                         were some pretty nosey citizens who 
                         wouldn't listen to reason. They said 
                         Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right

               Mary unwraps the reins from the whipstock.

</b>                         I don't like to see you go.

               Mary releases the brake and the surrey starts rolling forward.

</b>                         But that's the way it is. The live 
                         ones go out and the dead ones come 
                         in.

               The surrey starts down the hill. Graham looks after it, then 
               turns to go back to the buckboard, CAMERA PANNING WITH him.

               The town lies in a lush green valley. It is surrounded by 
               meadowland and shaded by cottonwoods, alders and aspen. In 
               the F.g. Graham's buckboard moves fast down hill.

               FULL SHOT. In the F.g. a smallish crowd, mostly men and 
               children idle in the street in front of Mary Wells' Gambling 
               and Dance Hall. The wooden sidewalk is cluttered with those 
               articles belonging to the women that were too bulky to get 
               into the surrey. Several women stand on the porch supervising 
               the locking up of the place and the removal of the sign of 
               Mary Wells' name on it. Graham's buckboard rounds a corner 
               at a fast trot. He slows the team to let the people get out 
               of the way.

               The team has slowed to a walk. The people give their attention 
               to the buckboard. A boy clambers up over the tailboard, sees 
               the cargo and jumps off with a frightened yell. The crowd 
               turns from the dance hall and follows the buckboard leaving 
               the women and their pious male assistants on the porch.

               the street. Far down the street comes Graham's buckboard 
               followed by the small crowd. The sheriff's office is a one-
               story wooden structure. Next to it is the general store. In 
               front of the blacksmith shop stands a wagon with one wheel 
               off. In the corral alongside are eleven blooded mares. Clay 
               Phillips, his brother Steve and the blacksmith are inside 
               the shop. Clay's saddle horse is tethered to the hitching 
               rail beside two harnessed work horses.

<b>               INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

               ANGLED to include sheriff's office. The blacksmith, Sam Ellis, 
               an elderly bent man in a leather apron stands at the forge 
               in which he is heating the rim from the big wheel which lies 
               on the table nearby. Clay, a long-legged wrangler in clean 
               but faded work clothes stands near the forge pumping the 
               bellows and watching his brother, a freckled kid of sixteen 
               trying to roll a cigarette. Steve has progressed to the most 
               difficult step, that of licking and sealing the paper. Clay 
               reaches over and takes it from him. He puts the skinny 
               cylinder in his mouth and Steve lights it for him. The first 
               third of the cigarette burns with one quick flare.

                         hand.

               Clay, the cigarette dangling from his lips, moves over to 
               the table, picks up a hammer and helps Sam hammer the rim on 
               the wheel. Steve stands watching.

               Together they lift the wheel and plunge it into the tub of 
               water. Steam rises to fill the blackened shed.

               From O.s. comes the SOUND of the approaching buckboard and 
               crowd. Steve hears the noise and moves to the front of the 
               shed.

               From his pocket, Gardner takes several communications, thumbs

               Steve picks up a rifle, puts it to his shoulder and squints

               Clay takes the makings from his pocket, starts to roll a 
               cigarette.

               Steve looks at Clay hopefully. He likes the prospect of having 
               these lovely women along.

               Clay finishes the cigarette, starts to put the makings back. 
               Mary holds out her hand. Clay gives her the makings. Mary 
               speaks as she casually rolls a cigarette.

               Clay motions to the remuda that grazes in the b.g.

                         horses like these.

               Mary has finished rolling her cigarette. She passes the bag 
               to Helen, who starts rolling one.

                         horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite

               Helen has finished her cigarette. She passes the makings to 
               Steve. He hesitates, looks at his brother and, when he sees 
               Clay is occupied with Mary, starts rolling one.

                         the horses.

               Steve finishes his cigarette. Again he hesitates, then not 
               wanting to seem young in front of these women he takes a 
               bold step and lights it. Clay reaches over and takes it from 
               him. Mary watches the byplay.

               Steve, embarrassed and hurt, turns quickly away. Helen looks 
               after the boy.

               He lifts some things out of the surrey and carries them toward 
               the wagon.

               She starts around the surrey. Helen follows.

               Clay bends over Elaine.

                         Can you fix it?

               As Clay turns from Elaine, Marcia joins the other two, their 
               attention on Clay and the surrey. Left alone, Elaine is 
               suddenly alert and no longer sick. She glances around, then 
               unobserved slides out from under the shade of the surrey.

               stop, jumps off, and comes running over. Elaine stands for a 
               moment, searching the ground with her eyes.

               Helen moves toward Clay. She smiles without humor. With this 
               new diversion, Elaine, still unnoticed, starts away -- back 
               toward where they dropped the trunk.

               Elaine stops now and turns as Clay takes the folding 
               daguerrotype case from his pocket. Elaine, her eyes wide and 
               frightened, starts back as Mary takes the case from Clay and 
               opens it.

               She jerks the case from Mary's hands, snaps it shut, and 
               stands staring at Mary with a strange mixture of fright, 
               anger and hysteria. Mary glances around as if to say what-
               did-I-do? To cover the embarrassed silence, Clay kicks the 
               unbroken back wheel. The spokes rattle.

               and starts toward the blanket again.

               side, Elaine is abruptly weak again. She leans against it 
               for support. Mareia moves to her as she slides back down on

               FULL SHOT. Dust rises over the road as the cavalcade moves 
               forward. Clay, rifle across his lap, rides in front. The 
               wagon, with Mary driving and Helen beside her on the seat, 
               follows. The two horses that pulled the surrey are tied to 
               the tail gate. Then comes the remuda with Steve bringing up 
               the rear.

<b>               EXT. CAMP SITE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               FULL SHOT. Long shadows of the hills lie on the grassy meadow 
               along the stream that is bordered by cottonwoods and willows. 
               A knoll overlooks the camp site. The caravan can be seen as 
               it halts in the lush grass a few yards from the stream. The 
               girls sit lifelessly on the wagon; they seem too tired to 
               dismount. Then, finally, Marcia helps Elaine to climb stiffly 
               down. With the exception of Mary they all let themselves 
               down in the grass. Mary walks to the head of the team and 
               starts fumbling with the harness. Steve comes into the scene, 
               dismounts quickly and pulls the saddle off his horse. The 
               remuda has fanned out, the horses moving toward the water. 
               Steve crosses to Mary and takes over the job of unbuckling 
               the harness. Mary smiles gratefully and rubs her hand across 
               her face.

               Steve straightens, looks towards the horses and moves off. 
               He speaks to Mary over his shoulder.

               Mary smiles after him, then moves across the grass, CAMERA 
               DOLLYING AHEAD of her. She sinks to her knees in the patch 
               of sand by the stream and leans down and puts her face under 
               the water. Then, sitting up, she wipes the water and dust 
               from her face with a handkerchief. Clay rides up from behind, 
               dismounts, scoops up some water from the river in the brim 
               of his hat and drinks it. For a second he watches Mary.

                         that dust off.

               Mary's manner is business-like. She and the girls are along 
               for the ride. She wants no favors -- wants to do her part.

                         Toward morning the dew gets kind of 
                         heavy so maybe you better fix up a

               unsaddling it. Mary rises.

               on the wheel, he gets the grub box under the seat and lifts 
               it down. Steve comes from out of scene and starts unharnessing

               Clay comes past him, carrying the grub box. He puts it down 
               near where some stones make a crude firebox.

               Clay squats by the stones and starts building a fire.

               letting the team drink. O.s. the women can be heard laughing 
               and splashing. Steve gives all his attention to what is going 
               on downstream. Clay puts wood on the fire, opens the grub 
               box. He sees Steve, takes the coffee pot out of the box and 
               heads for the stream.

               ANGLED PAST Steve downstream. Behind the willows the girls 
               are bathing. However they are too far away to be seen clearly 
               and the willows make a fairly effective screen. Clay walks 
               upstream and fills the coffee pot, then comes back to stand 
               for a moment beside Steve. Steve, who hadn't seen Clay until 
               now, suddenly gets very busy giving all his attention to the 
               mules.

               He jerks them from the water and leads them away. Clay frowns

               carries to the fire. He puts the iron strips across the blaze, 
               sets the coffee pot on, feeds the fire with some more wood, 
               then going back to the wagon, he takes his rifle out, throws 
               a shell into the chamber and starts off up the knoll.

               the campfire, and the shadowy forms of the girls as with 
               Steve's help they make up a bed under the wagon and cook the 
               evening meal. Clay suddenly reacts as O.s. a horse whinnies.

               over rolling hills. Faintly can be heard the SOUND of 
               hoofbeats. Below, where the remuda grazes, a horse whinnies 
               again. Clay moves down toward the camp.

               has spread out a tarp in the circle of firelight and Mary is 
               setting the tin plates, cups, etc., out. Elaine, a blanket 
               around her, sits near the fire. She looks tired and ill.

               the SOUND of men's voices. Clay, Steve and Clayton, leading 
               his horse, come into view.

               Marcia hugs him. In the B.g. Clay goes over to the fire,

                         won't work.

               The joy goes out of Marcia's expression. She looks up at 
               Jim, her eyes begging him to tell her it will work. Jim, a 
               naturally shy man, loses his tongue momentarily. Clay jumps

               Clay moves out of the circle of firelight to stop and pick 
               up his rifle, tarp and blanket, then climbs the knoll. Mary

               down the slope. Suddenly he stops and listens, as from O.s. 
               comes the SOUND of distant sobbing.

               In her anxiety, her tone is accusing. Clay drops the reins, 
               climbs into the wagon and bends down beside Elaine. He puts

               LONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH gate in barbed wire fence. The 
               ranch is nestled in a valley at the base of the Sierras. 
               Green meadowland surrounds the farm buildings which consist 
               of a cabin, barn and sheds, all in good repair and white-
               washed, as are the corral fences and the picket fence around 
               the house, which stands in a clump of trees. The wind has 
               pushed the clouds back over the hills, but far off there is 
               still thunder. The gate in front f.g. is of barbed wire. It 
               is closed. On the fence post a board is tacked. Neatly 
               lettered on the board is the name:

               From o.s. comes the SOUND of horses moving restlessly and 
               the creaking of saddle leather, as a man swings out of the 
               saddle. Footsteps approach. A man's head and shoulders, back 
               to camera, comes into scene. He unloops the strand of bailing 
               wire and lets the gate fall open, then turns and we see his 
               face. He is Lednov. His cheek and jowls have a dark growth 
               of beard. He wears a black leather jacket and a wrangler's 
               grey hat. The clothes Forster was wearing. As he moves back 
               to his horse, CAMERA PULLS BACK and PANS AROUND.

               His companions, McCall and Peters, also wear black leather 
               jackets, sombre, dusty pants and hats. They are mounted on 
               matched roans. The horses are winded, lathered and dirty. It 
               is obvious they have ridden hard. Lednov strides forward and 
               as he reaches for the reins the horse shies away. Brutally 
               he jerks on the reins. The horse rears. He snatches his hat 
               from his head and whacks the horse across the nose. McCall 
               rides over and grabs the reins. Lednov scrambles into the 
               saddle.

               There are cloud patches overhead and faintly in the back 
               country thunder rumbles. The mules pull the jolting wagons 
               forward in a slow trot. Clay rides ahead. Steve and the remuda 
               follow.

               up to the horses' trough. The horses plunge their muzzles 
               deep into the trough. As the men dismount, Wyatt, a sinewy 
               little man, hurries from the direction of the barn.

                         boys dropped in.

               He extends his hand to Lednov. Lednov ignores it. The three 
               men are looking around them. Two work horses, fat and elderly, 
               amble across the corral to nuzzle the roans through the fence.

               Wyatt is a little taken aback by Lednov's manner.

               Wyatt frowns up at Lednov, angered by the order.

               McCall and Peters move closer to Wyatt, who glances around 
               worriedly. Realizing he better do as he's told, he goes to 
               the roan and rubs his ears.

</b>                         Whoa, boy. Let's have a look.

               Bending, he lifts the horse's hoof. Lednov, McCall and Peters 
               watch him. He drops the hoof, straightens.

                         you're told.

               Wyatt hesitates. Lednov steps toward him.

               He picks up the roan's reins and starts leading him into the 
               corral. Lednov, with a jerk of his thumb, indicates that 
               McCall is to go with him. McCall follows. Lednov and Peters 
               turn toward the house.

               As Lednov and Peters start for the house, Mrs. Wyatt, a woman 
               of about fifty, small, plump, browned from the sun and hard 
               from work, comes out on the porch. She has taken off her 
               apron and holds it in her hand. She smiles at the two men.

               At his tone, the welcoming smile leaves her face. She looks 
               from one to the other. Lednov pushes past her up the steps 
               and into the house. Mrs. Wyatt follows him with her glance.

<b>               INT. RANCH HOUSE

               ANGLED PAST Wyatt. This is the main room of the house -- a 
               living room and kitchen combined: wood-stove against one 
               wall, a sink with a pump against another, a fireplace, some 
               simple furniture and, hanging from one of the rough walls, a 
               concertina. Through an open doorway can be seen the Wyatt's 
               bedroom. Another door, closed, leads into the second bedroom. 
               The house has a warm, well-scrubbed look. Wyatt enters.

               Mrs. Wyatt, stoking the stove, turns. She glances nervously 
               in the direction of the bedroom. Wyatt shifts his glance to 
               the fireplace -- there is no gun hanging from the hooks above 
               the mantel. Lednov appears in the doorway of the bedroom.

               Wyatt has had as much of this as he can stand. He starts

               She crosses to him and stands in his way. Wyatt pushes past 
               her and grabs for the guns. Lednov gives him a swipe with 
               the back of his hand, knocking him away easily.

               of shells, he slips it in his pocket.

               Through the gate ride Lednov, McCall and Peters. They stop 
               for a moment then turn right and trot along the fence line. 
               As they disappear, the SOUND of the caravan's approach is

               She turns back into the kitchen. Clay looks after her, then 
               hurries down the steps. Wyatt follows his wife inside.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Wyatt goes to the stove and starts stoking the fire. Mrs. 
               Wyatt takes the lamp from the wall bracket and goes into the 
               bedroom.

<b>               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               FULL SHOT. It is a pleasant room with a large, handmade, 
               double bed, white flour sack curtains at wide windows. Mrs. 
               Wyatt puts the lamp on the dresser. Going to the bed she 
               pulls back the covers, feels the sheets.

               Turning from the bed, she crosses to the dresser. Beside the 
               dresser is a camel-back trunk. She starts to open a dresser 
               drawer, pauses and looks down at the trunk. Moving to the 
               trunk, she hesitates. Then making up her mind, she bends 
               down and throws open the trunk.

               DOWN ANGLE. A girl's clothing is neatly packed in the trunk. 
               A framed picture is face down on top of the clothing. Mrs. 
               Wyatt kneels by the trunk, pushes the dresses aside and finds 
               a nightgown. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as she rises and shakes it 
               out. It is frilly, dainty, very feminino; obviously the

               as she goes to the bed, Wyatt comes through the door carrying 
               the towel-wrapped stove lid. She lays the nightgown on the 
               bed, takes the stove lid and puts it between the sheets.

               her down. Her eyes are closed. Slowly the Wyatts enter the 
               room to stand close together staring at the girl on the bed. 
               Clay suddenly realizes that something is wrong. He glances 
               up. Elaine opens her eyes and looks up at her mother and 
               father.

               out of the wagon.

               Mary smiles at her, shrugs and exits. Helen looks after her. 
               Mary's footsteps are heard going down the steps. Then Helen 
               swings around and going to Elaine's door, opens it.

               table by the bed and on it is a breakfast tray. Mrs. Wyatt 
               sits by the bed. Elaine looks happy for the first time. Mrs. 
               Wyatt is holding a cup to her lips. Helen enters and closes

                         catch you touching the dishes.

               She closes the door behind Mrs. Wyatt and comes back, sits 
               on the edge of the bed and holds the cup to Elaine's lips.

               She glances back at the bedroom, half smiling, then crosses 
               to the window and looks out.

               Helen enters the bedroom and closes the door as Clay comes 
               in. Clay looks around, then seeing the open bedroom door,

                         they cook and drive the mules. They

               Clay moves past them toward the corral. Mary looks after 
               him, then turning, motions to Helen. Helen starts toward the 
               wagon.

               Clay's horse stands saddled at the fence. He vaults into the 
               saddle, turns the horse.

               He rides off. Steve, delighted, runs to start loading the

               red granite domes of the higher range. O.s. there is the

               slowly. Far in the distance and down can be seen the waste 
               of desert and the barren hills of Nevada. Clay, a rifle across 
               his legs, is riding on one side of the wagon. Steve rides 
               beside Mary, who is driving. The remuda trails behind. Helen,

               Clay, as he peers down. He cocks his rifle. The voices of 
               Mary and Steve and the SOUND of the approaching wagon can be

               MED. SHOT of Lednov as he pulls in his limping horse, steps, 
               looking back over his shoulder as though he sensed an 
               unfamiliar presence. The other two watch him, frowning. Then 
               he shrugs and glances down at the bad leg of his mount.

               LONG SHOT. Clay, in close foreground, stands, leaning on his 
               rifle. The sun has set and the valley below is in shadow. 
               There is the silence of dusk. No wind stirs the trees. There 
               is some light outlining the high mountains -- treeless crags 
               and domes and spires. Clay turns.

<b>               REVERSE SHOT
</b>
               Down the hill in the forest, is the wagon. Beyond it the 
               horses stand. Steve is stretched out on his stomach studying 
               his magazine. Helen is sitting on a tarp playing solitaire. 
               Clay starts down the hill toward the camp.

<b>               MED. SHOT - UP ANGLE
</b>
               Clay walks through the trees. As he comes around a big yellow 
               pine, he stops suddenly and looks down.

<b>               MED. CLOSE
</b>
               ANGLED DOWN PAST Clay. Mary lies on the carpet of pine 
               needles, her head pillowed on her arms, her dress pulled 
               taut across her chest. She is looking up through the trees 
               at the fading sky.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
               Clay stares down at Mary. She does not look at him. She is 
               aware of his presence, but she doesn't show it. In the soft 
               light of dusk she is very lovely. Clay is conscious of her 
               lovliness. He would like to drop down beside her.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT
</b>
               Mary. She turns her face to look at him. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. 
               Clay stands above her, looking down. For a moment their eyes 
               meet. Clay starts away. CAMERA HOLDS ON Mary.

</b>
               ANGLED PAST Mary, who rises slowly. Clay looks back, 
               hesitates, then crosses to where the horses are tethered and 
               starts saddling his mare. Mary moves down toward him through 
               the trees.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Clay tightens the cinch. Mary moves up to stand beside him.

               He swings into the saddle, pulls the rifle out of the scabbard 
               and lays it across the pommel.

<b>                                     CLAY

</b>                         No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is 
                         keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead.

                         pick us out a new trail.

               He touches the mare with his spurs and trots down the hill. 
               He disappears around a bend in the trail.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Mary, in the f.g., is staring after Clay. Helen is watching 
               her. Steve has risen and walks up behind her. He smiles at 
               her.

                         I saw him saddling up and thought he 
                         was ready to leave.

               She starts down toward the wagon, Steve walking beside her 
               and CAMERA TRUCKING WITH them THROUGH the forest.

                         so you look at people and figure 'em

               They have passed Helen, playing solitaire on the canvas, and 
               have reached the place where the grub box stands. Steve 
               spreads a tarp for her.

               Mary sits down. Steve opens the grub box and takes out some 
               plates, tinned food and hardtack.

                         what you were thinking. Because I've 
                         been watching you.

               Helen.

               Steve looks over at her, embarrassed, a little hurt by her 
               tone. He rises, takes Mary's empty plate and his own and 
               goes over to the little spring to wash them. Mary looks

               around. The trail leads up through a canyon then narrows 
               along the edge of a cliff. The cavalcade toils forward. Clay,

               river, which boils out of a narrow canyon, then follows the 
               river through the canyon. Clay hands the reins to Mary, takes 
               his rifle.

               Clay swings down. The wagon moves past him. He frees his 
               horse, swings into the saddle and gallops down toward the 
               canyon.

               The wagon moves down toward the river. Clay disappears into 
               the canyon. Steve and the remuda follow the wagon.

<b>               EXT. CANYON TRAIL

               his rifle at the ready. Now he moves warily, keeping a sharp 
               lookout. The canyon is dark, sinister.

               Clay. He rides around the bend in the trail. He hears 
               something. He reins the horse in. Some pebbles rattle down 
               the cliff. He looks up.

<b>               FROM CLAY'S ANGLE

               The muzzle of a rifle is visible. Clay starts to bring his

               Clay lets his rifle rest across his knees. He looks up. 
               Fowler, a well-set-up young man in jeans, blue shirt and 
               worn jacket and wearing a battered hat, moves into scene.

                         and drove all night.

               at the edge of the meadow is Fowler's camp. The cavalcade is 
               driving up to the camp. There are two horses tethered in the 
               meadow.

<b>               EXT. FOWLER'S CAMP

               MED. FULL SHOT. A tarp is stretched over the camp. There is 
               a crude stone fireplace, a rough table and two benches. 
               Shelves are nailed between the trees. In a small lean-to 
               there is a bunk with Fowler's bedroll on it. Fowler stands 
               watching Mary and Holen as they get out of the wagon. The 
               horses sproad out across the meadow. Steve and Clay dismount. 
               Both unsaddle. Helen, Mary and Fowler exchange glances. Then 
               the two women walk toward the camp, which is behind a screen 
               of trees.

                         and climbing into it.

               She goes off and across the meadow. Mary looks after her, 
               shrugs and going to the fireplace, takes moss and twigs from 
               the pile and puts them in. Clay, carrying saddle bags and 
               canteens, enters.

               He puts them down, goes over to the fireplace and kneels to 
               light the moss. Mary has stepped back.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - LOW
</b>
               As he lights the fire, the lower portion of Mary's body comes 
               into the shot. Clay becomes aware of her closeness. He rises 
               slowly. CAMERA ANGLES UP. Mary is standing facing him, almost 
               touching him. They stare at each other without speaking. 
               Both suddenly move togother. They kiss. There is a SOUND 
               over shot and they step apart, looking off.

               Steve has come into scene and is looking at them. He smiles 
               with pleasure and surprise.

               Steve nods, smiles at both of them and goes out of scene. 
               Clay and Mary face each other. Suddenly Clay swings around 
               and goes out of shot after his brother.

               She looks after him, clearly in love, disappointed that they 
               were interrupted. Then she turns to the fire.

               Clay and Steve. CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of them as they walk toward 
               the wagon. Steve has begun to whistle blithely. Clay looks 
               sideways at him. Steve whistles even louder. They stop at 
               the wagon. CAMERA HOLDS. Steve climbs inside and hands down 
               the grub box.

               Clay puts the grub box on the ground. Steve tosses out the 
               bed rolls, then jumps out. He grins up at Clay.

                         Just because a man kisses a woman, 
                         doesn't always mean -- well, he can 
                         kiss her and not want to -- have her 
                         around all the time.

               Steve watches him, puzzled. His exuberance has gone.

                         keep it the way it is.

               him.

               Steve nods and carries the grub box out of the scene. Clay 
               stares after him. Then he picks up the bed roll and moves 
               around the wagon.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Clay in the f.g. In front of Clay stretches the meadow with 
               the river beyond. The horses are grazing in the meadow. Fowler 
               can be seen hurrying toward the aspens and alders that screen 
               the river.

</b>
               MED. SHOT. Here the river moves quietly down. The bank is 
               sandy. Alders and aspens screen it from the meadow. Helen 
               sits on the sand taking off her shoes and stockings. Her 
               toilet box is beside her. Something on the bank catches her 
               attention, she rises and climbs the bank. Some branches of 
               aspen cover an object. She pulls the branches away, revealing 
               a crud, miner's cradle or rocker.

               Fowler comes over and sits down beside her. He takes [a] 
               sack of tobacco and papers from his pocket. She reaches for

               She turns to the toilet case on the sand beside her, takes 
               out a comb. He glances at the box, then reaches over and 
               from it takes her powder box. He sniffs it. Without 
               irritation, as though borrowing a toy from a child, Helen 
               takes the powder box from him.

               Fowler hesitates. Helen hands him back the powder box as 
               matter-of-factly as she took it. He accepts it gratefully, 
               again putting it to his nose. Now he looks up at her, 
               regarding her calculatingly for a moment or two. Their eyes 
               meet.

                         thought to look for gold before.

               He reaches to his throat and lifts over his head a braided 
               loop of rawhide. Attached to the loop is a small, plump, 
               soft-leather poke. Still holding the powder box, he passes 
               her the poke. She starts to work with the thong.

                         week's work.

               Helen still struggles with the thong. He takes the poke, 
               pulls it open, pouring grains of gold into his palm. Helen 
               looks at the shining heap in his hand. Then she takes the 
               poke and pours some of the grains in her own palm. She looks 
               down at it. Her expression is calculating. She looks up at 
               Fowler and then the hard look goes away. She gives him a 
               soft smile.

               It is very quiet. She stirs, opens her eyes. Her expression

               Clay looks over at her. Then rising he moves closer, squats 
               and rolls a cigarette. He holds it out. She licks it, then 
               puts it in her mouth. Clay lights a match, holds it out. She 
               catches his hand and holds the flame to her cigarette.

               She holds his hand, smiling up. Clay hesitates, then desire 
               for her is more than he can bear, so he takes her in his

               For answer, Clay kisses her again -- hard, ruthlessly. His

               then draws back, waiting for him to say the words she wants 
               to hear. His hands pull her toward him. Mary wants the kiss -- 
               but she also wants a declaration of love. She makes one last

               Clay's grip on her shoulders tightens. She searches his face 
               with a glance -- stares into his eyes -- then pushes him 
               away and sits up.

                              (nervously)
                         Two men and some women. They packed 
                         their stuff on horses and went on.

</b>                         Yeah.

               He has edged closer to the gun rack. Lednov seems unaware 
               that he is near the guns. His interest is centered on the 
               lean-to. He moves to the entrance, stands with his hand on 
               the canvas.

               Lednov pulls back the flap. His back is to Fowler, who starts 
               quickly for the tree, only to stop as McCall comes out from 
               behind it.

</b>                         Looking for something?

               Fowler drops his hands to his side. Lednov turns, grins at 
               Fowler, and enters the lean-to.

               The shelter is dark. Lednov strikes a match and looks around. 
               The place is empty. There is a bunk, made up. On the left 
               hand wall a curtain of gunny sacks covers the clothes hanging 
               there. The match burns down to Lednov's fingers. There is a 
               SOUND of a scuffle outside a blow, and a groan. Lednov drops 
               the match and hurries out.

<b>               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
               Lednov comes out of the lean-to. Fowler is sprawled by the 
               table. McCall stands over him, rifle raised.

               Fowler sinks on a bench, his head in his hands. Lednov moves 
               closer.

               A twig snaps underfoot. Helen freezes.

<b>               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
               MED. SHOT. Lednov is staring off in the direction of Helen. 
               McCall moves to the edge of the lean-to, looking off.

<b>               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
               MED. CLOSE SHOT. Helen starts forward again, more cautiously 
               than ever. She reaches a tree, turns to look back.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
               Helen, back to camera, is in immediate f.g. Through the trees 
               can be seen the camp and the flickering fire. She turns, and 
               then fright comes into her expression.

<b>               REVERSE SHOT
</b>
               Peters stands in front of her. As he reaches out for her, 
               she tries to get away. He grabs her, wrapping his arms around 
               her.

<b>               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
               MED. SHOT. From o.s. comes the SOUND of Helen and Peters 
               struggling. Fowler, hearing the SOUND, gets to his feet. 
               Lednov and McCall turn on him.

               the camp.

<b>               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
               ANOTHER ANGLE. Fowler makes a futile dive for Lednov. McCall 
               swings his rifle. Fowler goes down. In the b.g. Peters drags 
               the struggling Helen around the lean-to into the camp.

<b>                                     LEDNOV

                         So you were all alone.

               He moves forward to meet Helen and Peters. Lednov reaches 
               out for Helen. Peters pulls her away.

<b>                                     PETERS

                         You keep your hands off.

               McCall has taken his attention from Fowler and gives it to 
               Helen. Unnoticed now, Fowler is struggling back to 
               consciousness. He tries to pull himself up. McCall turns 
               back and kicks him again.

<b>                                     HELEN

                         Let him alone!

               She rakes Peters' face with her fingernails, tries to fight 
               free. Lednov reaches out and grabs her arm. Peters knocks 
               his arm down. Free for the moment, Helen launches an attack 
               on McCall, who is getting ready to boot Fowler again. She is 
               on him like a cat, swarming all over him. He defends himself. 
               Helen is yelling furiously as she fights McCall.

                         back.

               Lednov has reached her now. He wraps his arms around her and 
               pulls her away from McCall. Helen tries to fight him.

               As the pain increases she blurts out Clay's name.

</b>                         Up the trail.

               In a fury, Lednov crushes her arm.

               He hurls her from him. She goes back against the table. Fowler 
               is trying to struggle to his feet. In blind rage, Lednov 
               raises his gun and fires. Fowler crumples. Helen looks down, 
               too horrified and terrified to scream. Lednov looks at her, 
               then almost casually he shoots her. McCall and Peters stand 
               watching as though frozen.

<b>               EXT. OPEN RIDGE FADE IN

               MED. FULL SHOT - ANGLES east. Behind the ridge rises the 
               range through which the pass to Nevada cuts its way. The 
               trail which has dipped down into a canyon comes up to follow 
               the ridge a ways and then drops down again. Lednov, McCall 
               and Peters ride along the trail. Lednov, in the lead, stops 
               suddenly and looks off.

<b>               EXTREME LONG SHOT
</b>
               DOWN ANGLE from Lednov's point of view. Far below is a meadow 
               and crossing it is a wagon road. This is the road from 
               Yosemite to Sonora. The road comes down the hill to the south 
               and, as the forest is open at this point, anything approaching 
               along the road can be seen for some distance. It crosses the 
               meadow and continues into the northwest. In the meadow is a 
               snake-rail corral. Clay's pack train comes out of the woods 
               above the meadow and starts down.

                         sitting up. I'm getting to the point 
                         where I don't think there's any place

               follows with Mary.

               Clay leads the pack train out into the clearing and toward 
               the road. A small creek threads its way through the meadow. 
               Clay rides up to the creek and swings out of the saddle. He 
               is taking the saddle off as the others ride up.

                         into the corral.

               He throws the saddle down, takes his rifle out of the 
               scabbard. Steve doesn't move.

               He turns a way abruptly and goes toward the road. Mary looks

               Steve goes back and starts unpacking the horses. Mary looks 
               off in Clay's direction, then stretches out and pillows her 
               head on her arm. Now the sun is coming up and driving the 
               darkness out of the meadow. In the distance Clay can be seen 
               climbing up on a rise.

               INTO the meadow. Steve has unpacked the horses. They graze 
               inside the crude corral. Steve is collecting wood for a fire. 
               Clay hurries down toward him.

               Steve squats beside the pile of needles, twigs and pine cones. 
               He strikes a match and sets the needles aflame. Clay hurries 
               into the scene and roughly kicks the fire out. Steve rises.

                         shirt or fire your rifle.

               Steve is ashamed of his thoughtlessness and for a moment is 
               apologetic.

                         You better start.

               Clay turns and goes over to where the packs lie. He kneels 
               beside the pack, rummages in them for hardtack and tinned 
               food. Steve looks after him.

               Steve. He is hurt and angry. Knowing he was in the wrong 
               about the fire doesn't help matters. He'd like to go off in 
               the woods and cry, but that's out of the question. Instead 
               he follows Clay and stands above him.

               Clay spreads the food on a tarp, sits down and starts eating 
               a hardtack.

               [As this scene continues, there is heard, faintly o.s. the 
               SOUND of little bells, the kind that teamsters put on the 
               hames of their horses. Over the hill, in the direction of 
               Yosemite, a stage is approaching. It is coming slowly uphill. 
               Soon it will be visible on the rise about a mile south of 
               the meadow.]

                         man enough to do that.

               Steve's voice rises during this speech. In f.g. Mary stirs 
               and opens her eyes. Then she sits up.

               Mary has risen. She is listening to Steve. She is also 
               listening to the bells.

                         you kiss her?

               Clay is ashamed but won't show it. He puts his hand on Steve's 
               shoulder and pushes him.

               Steve swings for his chin. Clay ducks the blow, grabs Steve's 
               wrist. Steve swings with his left, hitting Clay ineffectually. 
               Clay pins Steve's arms to his side.

               She walks toward them as Clay releases Steve and steps back. 
               Steve puts his hands up, making ready for another round.

               She turns and starts going through the kyacks, looking for 
               her things. Clay frowns down at her.

               Mary's attention is on the kyacks. From where Clay stands 
               near her he can see the trail leading down through open 
               country toward the meadow.

               He jumps out of the stage and follows Clay, carrying Mary's 
               belongings, around back of the stage. Mary gets into the

               Before Clay can speak, the driver snaps his whip and the 
               stage jerks away down the road. Mary doesn't look back. Clay, 
               in f.g., looks after it. Dust rises. It disappears around a 
               bend in the road. Clay turns and starts across the meadow. 
               Steve looks after Clay, hesitates, then follows.

                         amount to much to me. Look at the

               Recklessly Clay raises his rifle and fires three shots at

               LONG SHOT - DOWN. Lednov sees Steve running. He swings his 
               rifle away from the horses and tries to get the boy in his 
               sights. Clay fires again. A bullet smacks into the tree. 
               Lednov flinches. Then again he tries to center on Steve.

               Steve. He lies still a moment, then painfully he crawls to 
               the rails and with a great effort tries to tear the rails 
               down. Lednov fires. The bullet whistles past. Steve pulls 
               the fence down, crawls away from the opening. The horses, 
               milling around the corral break through. Steve lies still, 
               face down.

</b>
               Clay, now the hunter, moves toward Lednov's position. Lednov 
               fires. Clay runs and jumps into the creek. Sheltered by the 
               bank he makes his way up the creek.

               Lednov. He waits, his rifle ready. O.s. a twig snaps.

               of light filter through the trees, making patterns on the 
               forest floor. The light is dim, deceptive. Lednov, rifle 
               ready, searches for some sign of Clay. Then from another 
               direction comes the SOUND of movement. Lednov swings his 
               rifle in that direction, waits. The SOUND has stopped.

               His voice echoes across the hills. Lednov sights along his 
               rifle at the direction from which the SOUND of Clay's voice 
               came. Momentarily Clay is seen as he runs from one tree to 
               another. Lednov fires.

<b>               MED. CLOSE

               Clay. Clay cautiously edges around the base of a tree. He 
               picks up a stick, stops.

</b>                         Come on out.

               His voice can be heard echoing across the hills. He tosses 
               the stick. Lednov fires at the SOUND of the falling stick.

</b>                         Come and get me.

               As his voice echoes across the hills Clay quickly moves into 
               the open and fires.

               Lednov crumples forward as his echoing voice fades out. Clay 
               moves over to him to stand looking down.

               shirt is off and his shoulder is crudely bandaged. Clay, who 
               has been putting the bandage on, stands and takes a sack of

               Clay looks at him for a moment, not angry, but not admitting 
               he's wrong yet.

               posse, the bodies of Lednov, McCall and Wheeler slung across 
               the backs of horses, and Clay's remuda, trot down the street. 
               People come out of the hotel to watch the cavalcade pass. 
               Clay and Steve are not with the posse. Clay's horse is 
               tethered in front of the doctor's office which is next door

               holding a kerosine lamp. The doctor, a lanky, middle-aged 
               man, is working over Steve, who is stretched out on a table.

               which are the doctor's instruments. The room is cluttered. 
               The lamp, held by Clay, throws a circle of pale light down 
               on Steve. The doctor is working on Steve's shoulder and arm.

               as the doctor probes the wound in Steve's arm. Steve groans.
