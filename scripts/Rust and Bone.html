<b>          1. THE CHILD
</b>          Gradually more and more visible in the darkness, the face
          of a child, Sam. He is 6 years old, blond, pale and
          miserably thin. As we move in on his eyes, we see his lids
          quickly contracting.
          Under his eyelids: vestiges of the day's lights and
          shadows, of the day's noise.

<b>          2. EXT. - NORTHWEST LANDSCAPES. DAY
</b>
          A grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can
          knock a man off his feet.
          On the side of the highway, a large, muscular man with
          spiked blond hair: Ali Van Versh, 25.
          He has a big bag in one hand and a cell phone in the other.
          He talks on the phone as he continues walking:

<b>                         ALI
</b>          It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid
          with me. She can't take care of him anymore.
          I got into a fight with the guy she's with.
          I don't know where to go. What do I do with
          the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more
          credit... Call me back!
          He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Move it!
          His phone rings. He immediately answers.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do
          I get there? I don't know. Today or
          tomorrow. Yeah...
          Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny,
          he looks like a squirrel on his father's back.

<b>          3. INT. TRAIN.DAY
</b>
          There is a map of the French rail system near the toilets
          in a regional train. While Sam pees, Ali examines it. He
          follows the lines to plot out their trip. He arrives where
          France ends, at the Mediterranean. Sam comes out of the
          bathroom, straightening his pants.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I'm thirsty.

</b>          I'm thirsty!

<b>          4. INT. TGV. DAY
</b>
          A different speed, different countryside.
          Ali notices a half-empty bottle of Evian water left on a
          tray. He takes it. He searches through the garbage under
          other empty seats.
          Ali and Sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit, and finish
          off abandoned bottles of water.

<b>          5. INT. TGV. DAY
</b>
          Another TGV. Rain evaporates off the windows. Ali has
          fallen asleep. He's too big for his seat. Sam watches the
          landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat. Ali
          opens one eye.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Stop it.
          Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their
          banging.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I said to stop it.
          The sandals freeze.
          Cut.

          quickly.

<b>          7. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY
</b>
          Ali's face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon
          sun.
          Ali and Sam look at the sea, the beaches and hotels. It's
          hot and beautiful. They walk by tanned people in shorts,
          short skirts, sandals...
          In their shapeless grey track pants, they look like hoboes.
          Ali drags his sport bag with one hand and Sam with the
          other.
          Ali is on the phone:

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I don't know. A big street that started at
          the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We
          just came from there!
          Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to
          the beach...

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I'm tired.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on!
          Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder.

<b>          8. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY
</b>
          A four-lane avenue near the outskirts of town.
          Ali is walking on the shoulder of the road, with Sam piggy-
          back. A horn beeps. A refrigerated truck, blinking to get
          to the side of the road. The window rolls down to reveal a
          moustache and a cap: Richard.

</b>          (Southern accent)... A couple miles back I
          saw a blond guy. (Imitates screeching
          brakes) I stop short! "You Ali?" I ask. He
          says "No, me Kurt". Another few hundred
          feet, another big blond guy! (Screech) I
          ask "You Ali?" again. This time I didn't
          even understand what he answered. Another
          few hundred feet... Ten of them! Ten! Every
          Kraut and Flemish guy on the coast! So I go
          call your sister...
          Ali is thrown for a loop.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          (uncertain) You kidding?

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          A little.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          (to Ali) Is he a little crazy?

<b>                         RICHARD

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Yeah I do.

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          (pretending to be shocked) He doesn't like
          my truck!

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I do too like it!
          Worked up, Sam shrieks, holding his hands over his ears:

<b>                         SAM
</b>          (screaming) I like your truck!
          The road hugs the seashore. Ali watches beaches, homes, a
          railway line pass by... Voice over, we hear Richard's

<b>          10. EXT. SUBURBAN KITCHEN. DAY
</b>
          A kitchen with mismatched furnishings. China and cheesy
          wallpaper. Sam devours the cookies and Coke that Richard
          gives him.

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          We all got fired after some Spanish guy
          bought out the trucking company... Eight
          truckers. I thought it over, discussed it
          with your sister and figured I could do it
          on my own. So I bought this truck with my
          severance pay...
          Ali has finished his cream cheese sandwiches. He gets up
          and opens the old fridge.

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          Oops, poor man, not those! She'll kill you!
          Start with the expired ones, on the top
          shelf! They're organized by date. First the
          top shelf, then move down.... Anna brings it
          home from the supermarket where she works.
          As soon as they reach their expiration date,
          those idiots throw it all away, even if you
          can still eat it for a week! (to Sam) You
          want some more?

<b>          11. INT. SUBURBAN HOME. DAY

          Anna empties Sam's Spiderman bag onto the table, spilling
          out old, dirty, crumpled clothes.

          you have for him?
          Anna Van Versh, Ali's sister, is in her thirties. She is a
          huge woman, very tall with a pretty face. She wears
          leggings that make her ass look like a workhorse's and a
          pair of flip flops. At the bottom of the bag, Anna finds a
          passport and opens it. It is Sam's.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          She didn't remember anything. It was already
          in there. She forgot about it, that's all.
          When they went to Amsterdam, they'd use the
          kid to smuggle dope...

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          You got to be kidding!

<b>                         ALI
</b>          That's what she told me.
          Anna shakes her head in disbelief. A beat.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          How will you tend to the kid? I won't be
          able to all the time. I work, and so does
          Richard... Was he in school there?

<b>                         ALI

</b>          Um, no. (turns to Sam) You in school?
          No answer. Sam is watching TV.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          Back at your mom's place, did you go to
          school?

</b>          I can try to enroll him at the school. I'll
          see... We also need to get him some clothes.
          He can't go like that... I'll ask the
          neighbors.

<b>          12. EXT. GARDEN. EVENING
</b>
          Evening is falling. At the back of the garden are a home-
          made pen and doghouse. Four puppies come running. Sam
          touches them through the chicken wire.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          You want to pet them?
          She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws.
          They're just babies.
          Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          (to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next
          month. Brings in some money. Otherwise,

</b>          I have no idea, but if you stay here you
          have to pay your share, or else go somewhere
          else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy:
          we can't! How long were you thinking of
          staying?

          She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house,
          calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel,
          giggling in delight.
          He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to
          one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special
          50 moped, plastic junk, etc.
          Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights
          shining.

<b>          13. INT. BASEMENT. NIGHT

          In the cluttered basement, Sam is rolled up in a sleeping
          bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the
          antique Special 50 moped by the light of a flashlight.

<b>          14. INT. ELECTRONIC GOODS SHOP. DAY

          Ali wanders through an electronic goods shop, pretending to
          be interested in cameras. Through the shop window, he can
          see Sam waiting outside in the sun.

<b>          15. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY
</b>
          Suddenly, Sam sees his father run out of the shop, trying
          to shake a security guard hot on his tail. Sam watches them
          disappear into a tiny lane.
          Sam looks around a bit frightened.

          Farther off, in a busy shopping districtâ€¦
          Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists. The security
          guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a
          wall. They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath.

<b>                         SECURITY GUARD

          Ali keeps his cool.

</b>          Unzip it yourself!
          Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The
          guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges:
          The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right
          hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him
          flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the
          benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own
          biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off.

          Sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the
          terraces and ice-cream stores, looking for his father.
          Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot
          where they had left it chained up. He walks toward it. A
          voice calls out.

          Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who
          is sniffling, tears in his eyes.

          Saturday evening. The door to the Fever Ray night club.
          Patrons wait, bouncers pick and choose. An imposing
          Caucasian maneuvers the red rope. Behind him, Ali Van
          Versch and Foued Latahoui, who looks like a lightweight
          boxer, guard the door.
          Ali wears a faded blue "ALTA Secu" jacket and stiff,
          matching pants. Looking well-groomed, Foued is wearing a
          white shirt and tie. Well-groomed.
          A group of girls passes through the security barrier. Foued
          acts like he's hesitating:

<b>                         FOUED

          outnumbered. Four against one, I don't stand
          a chance!

          vanish.

<b>                         FOUED
</b>          You say something nice, anything. That way,
          when they leave, they remember you and you
          can hit on them. If they're a little
          plastered, if things didn't go too well for
          them, you're there with a nice thing to
          say...

<b>                         ALI
</b>          And it works?

<b>                         FOUED
</b>          Sometimes. But you can't be dressed like

          They are interrupted by the bouncer.

          They go running. Three guys are fighting like savages. Ali
          and Foued clean house. Foued gets rid of gawkers. Ali
          delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off

          While Foued chases the rowdy men toward the parking lot,
          Ali helps a girl back to her feet. She's a pretty blond,
          must be about 27 or 28, who has taken a punch in the face.
          It is Stephanie.

<b>                         ALI

          He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her
          to walk. She looks groggy.

          We hear a voice from the parking lot.

          Ali drives. His head seems to touch the roof of the little
          Fiat and his thighs are too thick for the seat. He glances
          over at Stephanie.

          Two rooms adjoining the locker room. Two desks, and on the
          walls pictures of the trainers with their orcas, laminated
          posters of various training methods, files for each animal.
          Stephanie is in her diving suit, sitting in front of
          Louise, a 23-year-old woman who is reading a document about
          her internship.
          A trainer leaves the locker room, his backpack slung over

          relationship with the orcas is stability.
          During your internship you've had your ups

          The empty stadium above the pool. The trainers walk along
          the gangplanks busily.
          In her diving suit, Stephanie leans over the "beach" of
          pool 3. She taps on the surface of the water. A wave
          forms, whirling around the pool.
          The whale washes up on the "beach" beside her. She performs
          what looks like a daily ritual. She examines the whale,
          caresses it. The whale responds with uncanny gurgles.

          Stock shots of a show at Marineland, or images which we

          the stadium.
          The sound equipment blares "Jump" by Van Halen, orcas shoot
          out of the water, the audience applaudsâ€¦ Little kids clutch
          electric-blue dolphin balloons, getting splashed by the
          orcasâ€¦ Images of the show are relayed on giant video
          screens, orcas shoot by like torpedoes behind the plastic
          protective wall in front of the main pool, etcâ€¦

          All at once, silence. Then surface noise, but muted by the
          cubic meters of waterâ€¦
          Underwater shots from pool number 3.
          Overhead, the surface shines like a mirror. In pool number
          3, a five-ton black shadow bides its time: it is Niska.
          Behind the grate in pool number 3, Niska watches her mates
          diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles.
          A mechanical creak, then the grate slowly begins to lift.
          It's about to be her turn.

<b>                         25

          Niska swims into the big pool, slowly at first, but then
          picks up speed. She surfaces, disappears for a long beat,
          then again reappears, churning up a whirlpool of bubbles.
          On the other side of the mirror, the music blares and the
          crowd cheers.
          What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into
          the pool. We recognize Stephanie. She caresses Niska's
          rostrum, then kisses it, hanging onto her fins, waltzing
          with her up to the surface. Her hands look ridiculously
          tiny on the huge black fins. We see her face mirrored in
          one of the orca's huge black, gentle eyes. A liquid world
          of greens and blues whirls around them.
          Now, with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum,
          Stephanie has Niska swim around the pool, accelerating the
          water pressure and speed. The plastic wall rushes by, a
          rush of adrenalineâ€¦ clouds of sediment are lifted as if by
          a gust of wind.
          A young male, Tom, joins Niska in pool number 1. Niska
          immediately rushes him, as if riled by the intrusion, and
          flattens him against the plastic wall.
          In the shifting reflections at the water's surface, we can
          make out Stephanie and two other trainers' faces on the
          â€˜beach'. Their palms beat on the water, summoning the orcas
          for their next number.
          Tom gathers some momentum, then shoots around Niska to jump
          into first place. He disappears a moment, then is back into
          the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning.
          Niska then gets into place and takes a running start, but
          just as she is about to shoot out of the water, Tom appears
          out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him.
          We sense chaos up above. Then we see Niska crash back into
          the water, with, one after the other, a piece of the huge
          video screen that towered over the stage, bits of scenery,
          and all kinds of random objects, as if Niska had carried
          away half the platform in her wakeâ€¦ It all seems to fall
          in slow motion, like flecks of snow in a snow globe.
          Something sinks toward usâ€¦ a body, floating weightless and
          disjointed in a cloud of red.

          Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving

          hanging on to them as they relearn to walk with their
          prosthetics. Most of them are old. Nurses help them along.
          From her wheelchair, Stephanie watches, looking glum and as
          if at a great distance. Her hair is greasy and her face
          swollen by her medication and induced sleep.
          She looks through the big window that opens onto the
          exterior. Outside, amputees smoke and chat. She notices one
          group, livelier than the rest. At its center, a guy is
          smoking a cigarette he holds in a pincer in the place of
          his hand. His name is Gilles.

          parking lot.
          Stephanie is sitting up front. She passes the joint to
          Gilles, who takes it in his chrome pincer. She notices the
          scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth.
          There is a couple in the backseat, making out: Raphael (his
          arms are missing and his sleeves are pinned up at his
          shoulders) and Julia.

          She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote

          Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there
          are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T-
          shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom
          whose legs hang limp.

          He notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a

          Heavy chain, padlock... he comes back with soiled hands.
          When he comes back, she's gone. He sees the wheelchair

          Ali rents the whole shebang: parasol, beach towel, deck

          and clumsily crawl some laps. His body is pink and white.

          wiggles out of her pants, revealing what remains of her
          legs. Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their
          extremities.

          She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually.
          She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and
          grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread
          water. He joins her. She grabs onto him.

          She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put,
          holding her t-shirt.
          Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a
          burst of laughter.
          Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time
          to see how she's doing.
          She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She
          motions for him to come and get her.
          He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on
          to him, still out of breath.

          The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck
          chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away.
          They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her
          lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe.

          Anna finally manages to rip Sam free and drag him back into
          the house.

          Anna storms into the living room. Sam is shrieking, having
          a tantrum. He kicks and bites.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I'm on the phone!

</b>          Cut it out, dammit! You're such a pain!
          He flings the child away. Sam's head hits the coffee table.
          Silence.
          Anna rushes over and picks up Sam, who has stopped crying.
          He's been knocked out. Anna is frightened. She examines his
          scalp, she strokes his head. She trembles. A cut on his
          head begins to bleed. She kisses the wound. Ali comes over,
          upset.

<b>          66. EXT. BEACH. DAY

          The day is over. The beach boy has already packed away most
          of his paraphernalia. In the water, Ali and Stephanie are
          out with some of the last swimmers.
          Faithful to what by now seems to have become a habit, he
          carries her piggyback to their lounge chairs. They come out
          of the water in the middle of a discussion.

</b>
          A narrow road. Down below, a town. The Mercedes Vito with
          the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust.
          Stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the
          overhead strap to avoid hurting herself.
          At the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge
          homies. They signal Martial to over.
          He rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside.
          They see Ali and Stephanie in the back.

          Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his
          reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial
          drives in.

          Ali and Stephanie are alone in the car. Through the tinted
          windows, they can see a concrete yard with boats dry-docked
          around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding
          every balcony. Some men are over in one corner,
          discussing: Martial, his cousin and some other mean looking
          guys.
          In the shade, a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans,
          is a bare-chested, muscle-bound North African. He warms up,

          Martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into
          the passenger seat.

          The blazing sun is melting the asphalt. A coin bounces
          between pairs of basketball shoes.
          The cousin picks it up. He points to Ali and the guy in the
          black shorts.

          fighters move away.

          Stephanie watches the faces leaning over the balconies
          overhead. She hears the spectators' hostility and cheers.
          A circle has formed around the fighters.
          She sees the shadow, and only the shadow, of his opponent's
          fist barely miss Ali's face.
          Then things speed up. Ali uses his feet, knees and fists.
          When his opponent begins to totter to one side, Ali hangs
          onto him like a pit bull. When he falls, Ali pounds on his
          face with his fists and elbows. The â€˜ref' has to enlist
          Cousin's help to pull Ali away.
          Ali returns to his place in the car. Stephanie looks at
          him: he can't sit still.

          She sees heads leaning over balconies.
          She sees an opponent's fist hit Ali behind the ear.
          She sees another of Ali's opponents get back to his feet,
          and Ali's fist split open his nose like a ripe fig.
          She sees another opponent's head bounce off the concrete.
          She sees a tooth roll across the concrete, like dice in a
          crap game.

          He looks at her, suddenly surprised.

          He tosses the envelope at her. She looks away. Ali finally
          gets back into the car with a big box. It's a toy: a green
          John Deere tractor with all the accessories.

          The afternoon sun has the entire coast sparkling. Ali is on
          his moped, with the box between his knees, driving up the
          coastal road. He looks splendid, wearing new clothes.
          He finally sees what he was looking for: a group on the
          beach, Anna, Richard and their neighbors, having a picnic.

          Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls
          out the envelope of money and hands it to her.

          of the group.
          They are packing away ice chests and folding things up. Sam
          and his little friends are playing in the sand with the
          John Deere tractor. Sam has a bandage on his forehead. Ali

          reads: "Stef". He doesn't answer. JoÃ«lle comes noisily. Ali
          puts his hand over her mouth.
          Through the window, we see Sam in Anna's garden, playing

          Sitting on the couch in a T-shirt and boxers, Stephanie
          finishes her dinner, watching TV distractedly.
          Balancing on her stumps, she puts her plate in the
          dishwasher. Then, supporting herself on her hands, she
          leaves the kitchen, wiggling her way into the bedroom. She
          lifts herself into bed as best she can.
          Evening falls over the bougainvilleas. Stephanie watches
          old people coming home in their wheelchairs or hanging on

          No answer. He knocks again. Finally, room 431 opens behind
          him. Martial looks out.

          disappear before coming back to cross the screen once

          that I turned them on... Afterwards, I don't

          Ali looks at her, strangely attentive, as if he didn't
          understand, or didn't believe her.

          She is thrown for a loop.

          He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous
          laugh.

          She wheels herself away from the table and into the

          Unsure of herself, she pulls a face.

</b>          Let's try.
          He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her,
          but she pushes him away gently.

<b>                         STEPHANIE

          He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering
          her. She tries to wriggle herself free.

          His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her
          thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets
          herself go.
          She grabs hold of him.

          Ali opens the fridge. He is dressed again. Stephanie
          appears in a robe, sitting in her wheelchair. We can tell
          she feels too shy to look at him.

          Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer.

          Stephanie uses one of her canes to push open the door to
          the staff room. The room is apparently empty.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Louise? Louise, are you here? Is anyone
          here?
          No answer.
          She looks over the office she once knew so well and that
          hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the
          wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names,
          etc...

          Up in the bleachers, Stephanie looks over all the pools,
          the big one as well as the others... suddenly, in nÂ° 3, a
          huge but limp black dorsal fin appears.

<b>          89. EXT. POOL N3. DAY
</b>
          Weighed down by her prostheses, Stephanie has to lie down
          on the rim of pool nÂ° 3 to reach the water. She reaches out
          and slaps the water with the palm of her hand. Nothing

          really happens, a black mass just keeps circling at the
          bottom of the pool... She slaps again and the black mass
          swims faster and faster... a wave is formed around the
          sides of the pool, a wave that swells higher and higher...
          Stephanie's hand again slaps the water and, suddenly, Niska
          emerges.

          Stephanie looks back to discover Louise and three other ex-
          colleagues. They have been there a moment, surprised,
          unsettled and ill at ease.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          I stopped by the office but there wasn't
          anyone.
          Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes. The guys
          rush over to help her. They hug and kiss. All four remain
          like that for a moment.

          Sun and music. The public is beginning to invade the lanes
          and paths.
          Stephanie, Louise and the other keepers are on the terrace
          of the employees' cafeteria. They are thrilled and
          reassured to see her again. At times a hand touches her
          arm or shoulder. Sometimes an acquaintance comes over and
          kisses her.
          Under the table, Stephanie types â€˜oper?' into her cell
          phone, then looks up and returns to her surroundings.
          We can imagine the "How are you?" "And you?" "Great". The

          her, leans over to her:

</b>          (softly) See? It wasn't hard!
          They smile at each other and return to the conversation in
          progress. Stephanie's cell phone vibrates on the table. She
          discreetly checks the answer, and when she looks up,
          exchanges a glance with Louise.
          From that glance, we cut to:

          her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie:

<b>                         ALI
</b>          (to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my
          sister! (to Anna) This is Stephanie. You
          know the girl from Marineland.
          Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then
          realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth:

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          Oh, my God. Poor thing!

          Sam arrives with his snack. Stephanie looks at him.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          So that's him?
          They are sitting around the garden table. Anna comes
          carrying a tray.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          They were out of grapefruit. I took tropical
          fruit.
          She puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on
          the table. Through a hole in the oilcloth, Stephanie can
          watch Sam playing under the table.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          I'll make tea. I have some cookies. You
          drink tea, don't you?

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Don't bother. This is perfect, I swear.
          Thanks.
          Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the
          way back to the kitchen.

<b>                         ALI

</b>          You freak her out. Can't you see? She feels
          like a cashier with you. Pathetic with her
          tea and cookies. It's a pain.
          Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          What are you doing?

          Later, Sam guides Stephanie up the narrow stairs of the
          house. She has a hard time with her â€˜legs' and canes.

          A child's room with cheap wall paper depicting dolphins.

</b>          So this is where you sleep? It's a nice

          Sam nods in agreement. He gives her a strange look.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Why are you looking at me like that? Does it
          scare you? You want to see them, is that it?
          He nods.
          She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis
          underneath. Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand,
          touches it carefully.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Does it hurt?
          Stephanie smiles at him.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          No... Want to touch it?
          Sam reaches out his hand.

          In CU through the tinted windows of Martial's Mercedes
          Vito: the face of a boxer who is lying on the ground and
          being pummeled.
          Ali is sitting bare-chested in the back seat, a towel
          around his neck and a bottle of water between his knees.

          Ali watches the fight. Sitting next to him, Stephanie fills
          a plastic bag with ice cubes. She hands it to him.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Here.
          He applies it to his eyebrow. She displaces a bloody strand
          of hair and replaces it with another.
          We see Martial return to the car and open the front door.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          You okay?
          He puts a wad of money in the glove compartment.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          You ready?
          Ali nods â€˜yes'. He opens his door, gets half out and
          empties the bottle of water over his head.
          Stephanie is left alone in the car. She hears the
          spectators' cheers. She closes the window and turns on the
          air conditioning full blast.

</b>
          His opponent's guard is up, closed tighter than a safe.
          Behind his fists, Ali can see the guy's frozen stare. And
          then suddenly he breaks loose: a series of feints and a
          kick behind the ear.
          He hears himself growl, the light becomes electrifying. He
          is on the ground, protecting himself as best he can. He
          tries to block his opponent's arm. He hears himself
          wheezing and panting like a pair of bellows. He sees his
          blood splatter his opponent.

<b>                         ALI (OFF)
</b>          ... All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's
          like it tasted like bone. A taste of rust
          and bone.

</b>          Yeah, there I did.
          Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something:
          sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just
          opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a
          pair of shortsâ€¦ He also sees the heads of the tough guys
          who turn back to look.
          He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of
          blood and returns to the task at hand.
          His opponent tries to get up. Ali jumps on him to finish

          The car is driving back into town. Martial is driving. The
          windows are open. Ali holds a bag of ice against his cheek
          bone, while Stephanie applies her Band-Aids to a cut over
          his eyebrows. They are talking, but we can not hear what
          they say. All we hear is the noise of the wind against the
          open windows. Ali suddenly breaks out laughing. Martial
          does too in the rear view mirror. Stephanie follows suitâ€¦

          Ali and Martial follow the head of security into the store.
          Some of the personnel are near the cash registers, silent,
          hostile and immobile. The morning customers wonder what's
          happening.
          The head of security elbows his way through.

          Ali recognizes the place with the palettes up to the
          ceiling. In the back, he also recognizes the manager,
          protected by two guards and being harangued by union
          representatives.

<b>                         MARTIAL

          been piled up on the floor. It looks more like the crime
          squad has been at work. Ali opens a garbage bag and bends
          over to retrieve the equipment.

<b>                         WOMAN (OFF)

          He is lying nude on the bed of his Formule 1 hotel room. He
          smokes and stares at the ceiling. His suitcases and bags
          are packed, all he has to do is close them.
          He hears knocks next door. He gets up with a sigh, pulls on
          his pants and opens the door. Stephanie is waiting in front

          health plans. Am I wrong?

          A shadow crosses Stephanie's mind. She looks at the open
          bags and suitcases, without really seeing them. The place
          looks like it's expecting a police raid.

          the tattoos on his arm: a green and red snake that seems to
          be slithering out his sleeve. The barman brings two bottles
          of champagne.
          Ali leans toward her:

</b>          Want to boogie?
          She doesn't understand.

          She looks frightened, but then smiles when she sees what
          he's up to.

          He goes to the dance floor and begins to rock. He dances
          badly, clumsily. Martial pours champagne.

          The smoking area is located outside, and a bit farther off,
          the dope smoking area. Behind the smokers, we hear noise
          from the club. Cousin is puffing on a spliff. Stephanie
          watches, holding her champagne goblet. He offers it to
          her. She accepts and takes a drag.

          We are back inside. Ali is working on a girl a bit farther
          off on the dance floor. Stephanie follows Cousin through
          the noise and sticky heat. When she next looks at the dance
          floor, Ali is no longer there.
          Ali and the girl are on their way to the exit. Ali looks
          for a friendly face, meets Stephanie's glance and motions
          that he's leaving. She waves: "Yeah, ok, I get it."
          Ali disappears with the girl.
          Stephanie is at the bar, drinking. She types an SMS into
          her cell phone: "operational?" She hesitates, then puts

          The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He
          might be thought to resemble Simon.

</b>          Come here often?
          Stephanie is on automatic pilot. When she turns to the
          room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her. She
          can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts
          under her T-shirt. She answers his questions, she returns
          his smiles. When she finishes her glass and puts it down on
          the counter, he kisses her. She doesn't push him away
          immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time
          to put a good face on it.

          away.

          Foued runs to warn Martial, Khadi and Cousin that something
          is wrong.
          When Martial arrives, he sees Stephanie collared by a
          bouncer three times her size. She lashes out with one of
          her canes, while under the bar, another bouncer tries to
          help the blond guy back to his feet. There's a deep gash on
          his skull.
          Cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand.

          Early morning. The shrill screech of the sea gulls and the
          milky light of a day that looks like it's going to be
          sunless.
          Stephanie drinks her coffee at the only table on the
          terrace. Behind her, chairs are still piled up and the
          waiter is slowly getting to work.
          A silhouette appears on the sidewalk. It's Ali, in the same
          clothes as last night. He joins her and takes a seat.

          flesh resounds. Outside the ring, Ali cheers Foued on.
          He notices on the other side of the ring a young thin,
          bearded guy in a Lacoste polo shirt buttoned up to his neck
          - Leonardini - who is following the fight with the eye of a
          pro.
          When Ali and Joao are later working out on their bit of
          tatami, Ali sees Foued sitting on a bench, with a towel
          around his neck and talking with Leonardini.

          Through the tinted windshield of a Nissan Pathfinder SUV,
          Ali watches Stephanie, wearing a tight T shirt and leaning
          on her cane, talking with Cousin and some bettors. The
          discussion looks intense.
          Stephanie returns to the car. Below her pedal pushers, her
          prostheses sparkle in the sunlight. We hear salacious jibes
          from the surrounding buildings.
          She opens the car door.

          Walking with a slow, deliberate sway - aware of the effect
          she's having - she ceremonially opens the passenger door.
          The remarks cease.

          CU: a black and red arrow with, in industrial characters:

</b>          It's the tattoo on Stephanie's right thigh. Ali's hand
          grips and squeezes the thigh. They are making love.
          The room is half-lit. Ali growls and grinds his teeth in
          his sleep. Stephanie slowly and noiselessly rolls over to
          her side of the bed. She gets up and, using her hands,
          drags herself toward the bathroom.
          Suddenly, feeling like he's suffocating, Ali awakens. It
          takes a few seconds for him to realize where he is. His
          hand sweeps across the bed.

          They look at each other.
          He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her.
          Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places
          her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving.
          She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock.
          She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away,
          surprised.

          Italian cities. The landscape has changed.
          Wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses, Stephanie drives
          with her elbow out the window. On the radio, we hear the

          puffing. He stops, takes a few steps, then continues, but
          soon stops again. It looks as if his feet are weighing him
          down. Traffic speeds by. He stands still and stares into

          Ali's head spins.

          How much did you get for that? You get paid
          per person or a flat rate? Nothing to say? I

          Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand
          delivers a resounding slap.
          He takes it like a man. A moment passes. Ali is red from
          the slap, red with shameâ€¦ until he suddenly straightens up
          and knocks over the table.

          begins to stuff things into a bag.

          Night has fallen. Sam's nose is stuck to his bedroom

          the garden downstairs with her face in her hands.
          A door slams. Sam rushes to the bathroom window. He sees
          his father stomp down the street, never once looking back.
          Sam remains glued to the window pane.
          Ali's silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight
          before again disappearing into the dark. Sam watches him

          A path runs through fields and into a clump of fir trees.
          Ali pulls a plastic sled with Sam on top. Whenever there is
          a slope, he lets Sam glide down it and runs after him.
          Snow falls from the trees. He looks up and sees a couple of
          squirrels jump from branch to branch. Sam has never seen
          any before. Ali neither.

          On the way back, they find a frozen pond. Ali carefully
          advances on the ice. He tests it. Jumps on it. Then he
          lets himself go and glides across the ice.

          Ali pees behind a tree.
          Sam is far away.

<b>                         ALI

          And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He
          tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is
          forming over him.

          kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole.
          Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks
          everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise,
          blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawls

          sees Sam's face, staring wide-eyed.
          Ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice, like pistons
          or pestles... As if pounding on his punching bag.

          Leaning against the window of the Intensive Care Unit, Ali
          sees Sam's nude, tiny body being worked on by doctors...
          his skin is blue from the cold... there is a tube in his
          mouth... his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a
          respirator... his mouth spits out brackish water
          brutally...
          A door opens and a nurse appears. Ali straightens up.

<b>                         NURSE
</b>          We'll take care of you. Come with me.
          He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his
          hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred
          fingers, his broken, bloodied hands.

<b>          143. INT. SAM'S HOSPITAL ROOM. EVENING
</b>
          Sam is lying in a hospital bed. His eyes are closed and
          coils of tubes attach him to control apparatus.
          Ali is at his side. His hands are now wrapped in thick
          bandages. The disinfectant makes him look like he is
          wearing yellow gloves halfway up his arms.
          Richard is standing behind him, near the window.
          Ali takes Sam's fingers, places them in the palm of his
          bandaged hand and looks at them.
          Sam's eyes begin to dart wildly under his eyelids... his
          fingers quiver... his eyes open.

<b>          144. INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR. NIGHT
</b>
          There are not many people in the corridor at this late
          hour. Richard is bent over a coffee machine. A cup slowly
          fills up. Farther off, Ali is KO, leaning against a wall.
          Richard brings him a coffee. Ali takes it clumsily into his
          damaged hands.
          Richard's cell phone rings. He moves away to answer and
          speaks into it softly. A few moments later, he returns to
          Ali and hands him the phone.

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          Here. She wants to talk to you.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Anna?
          Richard shakes his head.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Hello?

<b>                         STEPHANIE (OFF)

</b>          Okay. He woke up an hour ago.

<b>                         STEPHANIE

<b>                         ALI
</b>          No, I don't think so.

</b>          And how are you?

<b>                         ALI

</b>          I'm not asking for anything. I'll be going.

<b>          145. INT. POLAND. HOTEL ROOM. DAY
</b>
          A child sleeps.
          His eyes are darting under his eyelids: vestiges of light
          and shadow, of noise.
          Sam opens his eyes: he is in a hotel room. At the foot of
          the bed, a TV with the sound turned down low is
          broadcasting a cartoon of mice fighting in Polish.
          Stephanie comes and goes, picking up things littering the
          floor and packing their bags.
          Over these images, we hear Ali's voice:
          The human hand contains 27 bones. Some
          monkeys have more: gorillas have 32, five in

<b>                         121
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         
          each thumb. For humans, it's 27.
          If you break an arm or a leg, after a while
          calcium gathers around the bone and joins it
          together. In the end, it's stronger than
          before. But if you break a bone in your
          hand, you know it'll never fully heal.
          You'll think about it before every fight.
          You'll pay attention... And even if you pay
          attention, the pain will come back... like
          needles, like broken glass...
          Ali is wearing a T-shirt. He still bears the marks of
          yesterday's fight. His eyebrows and hands are bandaged.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Wake up, kiddo. It's over. We're going home.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Did you win?
          He smiles and kisses his biceps.

<b>          146. INT. POLAND. HOTEL - LOBBY. DAY
</b>
          The lobby of a Holiday Inn, the day after an Ultimate
          tournament... (much the same ambience as in Turin) The
          fighters, winners and losers, are about to leave. They
          greet each other, pose for photographers, answer
          interviewers, sign autographs... Ali's hands are still
          bandaged. He is being interviewed along with a kind of
          Viking with a closed eye and broken arm.
          Ali goes to join Stephanie and Sam outside the hotel, where
          a taxi driver is loading their luggage. A young Polish fan
          calls out: "Ali! Ali!" He wants a photo.
          Ali lifts Sam into his arms and pulls Stephanie closer.
          They pose.
