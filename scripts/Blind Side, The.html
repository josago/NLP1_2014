<b>          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
</b>          There's a moment of orderly silence
          before a football play begins.
          Players are in position, linemen
          are frozen, and anything's
          possible. Then, like a traffic
          accident, stuff begins to randomly
          collide. From the snap of the ball
          to the snap of the first bone is
          closer to four seconds than five.

<b>          2 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT 2
</b>
           We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday
           Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the
           two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the
           ball. As the play begins --

<b>          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
</b>          One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the
          Redskins quarterback, takes the
          snap and hands off to his running
          back.
          JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps
          forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann.
          The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film.

<b>          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>          Two Mississippi. It's a trick play,
          a flea flicker, and the running
          back tosses the ball back to the
          quarterback.
          HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has
          the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and
          to the side and Carson flies past.

<b>          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>          Three Mississippi. Up to now the
          play's been defined by what the
          quarterback sees. It's about to be
          defined by what he doesn't.
          LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins
          lineman trying to block him.

</b>          The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses.
          Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann.
          The image FREEZES.

<b>          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>          Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor
          is the best defensive player in the
          NFL and has been from the time he
          stepped onto the field as a rookie.
          The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes
          Theismann's body.
          PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating.
          TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman.

<b>          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>          He will also change the game of

          just don't watch.

          down of football.

          often than not the highest paid
          player on an NFL team is the
          quarterback.

<b>          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>          And you'd be right. What you
          probably don't know is that more
          often than not the second highest

          Taylor, a left tackle.

          the first check you write is for
          the mortgage and the second is for
          the insurance. The left tackle's
          job is to protect the quarterback
          from what he can't see coming. To
          protect his blind side.

          A street anchored by project housing and littered with broken

          about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving
          TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed.
          He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully
          steps instead of strutting. His name is MICHAEL OHER.

          is due to lack of records. He has
          a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th
          percentile. He's been enrolled in
          seven different institutions,
          including a gap of eighteen months
          around the age of ten when he
          apparently didn't attend school at

          eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry
          their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with
          friends they haven't seen over the summer.
          Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the
          arch. Beneath the school name we read "WITH MEN THIS IS.
          POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE". Michael takes a
          deep breath and enters. He carries his "school bag" - a
          plastic grocery sack.

          Just as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those
          around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only
          the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants
          and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to
          the fact that he doesn't belong here.
          Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a
          wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone.

          It's Mrs. Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the
          board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters. He
          pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to
          stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then...

<b>          MRS. BOSWELL
</b>          Class, this is Mike Oher and he's

          corner, looking terrified. He barely fits in the seat.
          Mrs. Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row. As
          students pass them back to others...

          Just answer whatever you know.
          The student in front of Michael hands a sheet back to him and
          eyes the size of his feet.
          The students start to work while Michael stares at the sheet
          like it's written in Greek. Mrs. Boswell watches him for a

          Michael sits alone while Mrs. Boswell collects the last of
          the papers. She walks over to Michael, looks down at his
          sheet. Nothing filled in, just his name scrawled at the top.
          She tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for --

</b>          It's okay.

<b>                         MICHAEL

          She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances
          down at the sheet, turns it over and sees...

          single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a

          expecting me to do the problems on
          my own. I have never done homework
          in my life. I go to the bathroom,
          look in the mirror and say, "This
          is not Michael Oher."
          (a pause for effect)
          He entitled it "White Walls."
          The room is dead quiet.

          sits by himself without a tray in front of him.

          else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up.

          says she's about to give up when
          He lifts his eyes to her and points to --
          -- the question on the test - specifically to the word

          the huddle and Michael just stands there. He notices the
          other defensive linemen get in a stance and kind of squats a

          It's a good school. Not at the

</b>          When they find a body the police

          lots of body parts - arms, legs,
          hands - from hospitals and medical
          schools. Do you know where they
          store them?

</b>          Courage is a hard thing to figure.
          You can have courage based on a
          dumb idea or a mistake, but you're
          not supposed to question adults, or
          your coach, or your teacher because
          they make the rules. Maybe they
          know best but maybe they don't.

          least one of the six hundred guys
          think about giving up and joining
          with the other side? I mean,

</b>          That's why courage is tricky.
          Should you always do what others
          tell you to do? Sometimes you
          might not even know why you're
          doing something. I mean, any fool
          can have courage.

</b>          But honor, that's the real reason
          you either do something or you
          don't. It's who you are and maybe
          who you want to be. If you die
          trying for something important then
          you have both honor and courage and
          that's pretty good.

          courage and hope for honor. And

</b>          She's an onion, Michael. You have
          to peel her one layer at a time.
          Michael walks over to the car, knocks on the window. She
          rolls it down, dabbing tears from her eyes.

          She gets out of the car and holds him for a long time.

</b>          In the last paragraph they talked
          about his superb athletic skills
          and how different his life might
          have been if he hadn't fallen
          behind and dropped out of school.
          He was twenty-one years old the day
          he died. It was his birthday.

          the other Michael/crowd shots with one difference - this time
          he moves at the same speed as everyone else.
