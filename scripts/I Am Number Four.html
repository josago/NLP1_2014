          sleeping jungle. A fingernail moon silvers the whispering
          canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise.

</b>
          CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS

<b>          A BUNGALOW.
</b>          It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden
          shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been
          crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness.

<b>          INT. HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the
          space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies
          in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.
          The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until

<b>          THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.
</b>          The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks
          over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold
          their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.

<b>          ANOTHER RATTLE.
</b>          It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as
          the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow
          and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans
          in and peers through the bamboo slats.
          WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.
          Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his
          face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of

<b>          A SERRATED METAL BLADE
</b>          protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously
          protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted
          eyes and whispers his last, desperate word...

<b>          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints
          through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off
          the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves
          impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.

<b>          A MONSTROUS HOWL
</b>          ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins
          thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread
          and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.
          He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races
          up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of

<b>          A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!
</b>          GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He
          kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite
          lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of

<b>          A HULKING BEAST.
</b>          It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.
          It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,
          the Teen turns to make his escape when

<b>                         A HAND
</b>          wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a
          TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.

<b>          THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.
</b>          He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the
          briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the
          geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted
          against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises

<b>          A SWORD.
</b>          Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps
          towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA
          ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.

<b>          FORM CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          THE SAME SYMBOL.
</b>          It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles
          away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet-
          ski race with TWO BUDDIES.

<b>          3.
</b>          The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages
          on the beach.
          Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his
          opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of
          triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels

<b>                         THE SYMBOL
</b>          searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his
          ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams
          across the water.

<b>          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
          LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light
          flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh
          like a brand.

<b>          EXT. BEACH - DAY
</b>
          Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand,
          clutching his ankle. He rolls onto his side as a CROWD OF
          PARTYING TEENS gathers. A BLONDE GIRL leans down to help.

<b>                         BLONDE GIRL
</b>          Daniel, what's wrong? Did you
          break your ankle?
          But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from
          between his fingers and reels back.

<b>                         BLONDE GIRL
</b>          Oh my God.
          He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to
          his feet and takes off running.

<b>          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY
</b>
          The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.
          Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure
          outrunning the hurtling vehicles.

<b>          EXT. COASTAL FOREST - DAY
</b>
          Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track. The
          pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same
          hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique. He
          peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive.

<b>          A STILT HOUSE
</b>          sits at the end. It's cake-frosting pink and is built right
          on the edge of a coral-white beach.

</b>
<b>          EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          The door flies open and Daniel stands on the threshold.
          HENRI looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news
          feeds. He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays
          and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French.

<b>                         DANIEL
</b>          Number 3 is dead.
          Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his
          feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on
          the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully
          raw. Directly below this fresh wound are

<b>          TWO OTHER GEOMETRIC BRANDS.
</b>          They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different.
          Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.
          Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Did anybody else see this?
          OFF Daniel's panicked nod...

</b>          skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as
          Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag. The
          walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality.
          Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables.

          TIGHT ON A BOX. It's exquisitely carved and inlaid with an
          intricate geometric design.
          Henri carefully hides it under the driver's seat of an old
          Jeep Wagoneer. It's the kind with wooden trim. He looks at
          Daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring FIRE.

<b>                         HENRI

<b>          5.
</b>          Daniel clicks the SIM card from his cell phone, snaps it in
          two and drops it into the fire. Bitter, he takes one last
          look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep.
          As the engine HUMS to life, CAMERA FOLLOWS

<b>          THE GECKO.
</b>          It darts up the fender, squeezes into the jamb of the trunk,
          and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its tail.

          The Jeep powers across the long elevated bridge. The dying
          sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues.

<b>          DANIEL (V.O.)
</b>          This is the part I hate the most.
          The running. But it's the only
          thing in my life that's real. The
          rest is a lie. My name. My
          birthday. Even Henri. People
          think he's my father. He's not.
          His job is to keep me alive.

<b>          INT. JEEP - NIGHT - MOVING
</b>
          Henri's eyes scan the rear view, on constant vigil. The
          speedometer never brushes past 60. Daniel has his head
          against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod.

<b>          DANIEL (V.O.)
</b>          We are hiding from the Mogadorians.
          A brutal race that wiped out our
          entire planet, Lorien.

<b>          EXT. USED-CAR LOT - DAY
</b>
          Plastic flags whip overhead. Daniel leans against a silver
          SUV and watches Henri negotiate with the DEALER.

<b>          DANIEL (V.O.)
</b>          Only nine children escaped the
          genocide. We were each given a
          number and sent here to hide. I
          don't know where the others are. I
          only know when one of them is
          murdered.

          Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the
          bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat
          scab that has formed over the wound.

<b>          DANIEL (V.O.)
</b>          I got the first scar when I was
          eight. I woke up screaming. We
          lived in Vermont. The second was
          on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in
          Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was
          the third.
          His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.

<b>          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

          The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant
          farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony.

<b>          DANIEL (V.O.)
</b>          Because of the spell our Elders
          cast, the Mogs can only kill us in

          Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over,
          his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a
          soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won.

          There are 335,321 John Smiths in
          the United States.
          (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.)
          John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away.
          Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.

</b>
          A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the
          buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches.
          They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen.

          Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
          frustration.

          John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.

          Henri pulls up in front of a small house. It sits by itself,
          surrounded by trees. Water sluices off the weather-worn
          garage in the yard behind it. A WOMAN steps out of a minivan
          to greet them.

          They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need
          of a makeover. A grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the
          end of the hall. Annie remains relentlessly optimistic.

          notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out.

          John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot.
          The camera is cabled to one of the laptops.
          TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital

          Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door.
          Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE.
          SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes.
          Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently
          signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of
          an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek
          crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door...

<b>          INT. CLOSET - JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          ... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat.
          Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds
          his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is
          relieved to see Henri.

          John enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of
          school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a
          plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in
          front of him.

</b>          I already have a backpack.

          John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He
          pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out
          the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of
          hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out.
          It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.

          Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he
          passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a

          checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne,
          who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to
          react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.

<b>          VOICE (O.S.)

          John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a
          battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an

          Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs
          young John and charges up. As the Commander breaks cover,
          Henri hurls the dagger.

          Henri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one
          direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other.

<b>          A MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT
</b>          suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants
          ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes
          the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as
          two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat-
          haze and catches a impressionistic view as

</b>          leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and
          their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken
          mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to
          help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON
          YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams...

          too overwhelmed and runs out.

          A stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to
          toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles
          the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the
          woods and crosses to his side.

          in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at

          An annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters.
          The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the
          shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron.

          candy. John subtly scans the crowd.

          John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some
          KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye,

          local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie
          her camera. Sam whispers to John.

          John angrily strides forward, palm outstretched.
          NIGHT-VISION POV: Everything is an overexposed blur until --

</b>          John brutally clotheslines one, then pummel-rams Kevin in the
          chest, sending him flying back 10 feet into a tree. Kevin
          slumps, out for the count. John arcs a glowing hand through
          the darkness.

          Sarah is carried through the woods by TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS in
          camouflage fatigues and night-vision goggles. She SCREAMS.

          head towards it when

<b>          TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS

          the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and
          CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS.

          Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.
          WHAT HE SEES: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a
          luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles.

          A rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall
          which drops into a swimming hole below. The Zombie Jocks
          carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark. She's

          Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance
          and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by
          concern. He steps towards her to help when --

          festooned trees. John walks with Sarah. They come to the

          As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her.
          Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his
          passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,

          when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs
          grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from her.

          blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'-
          lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells.
          Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an
          explanation. He does his best to cover his stunned reaction.
          Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall. John puts up his hood.

          The Halloween decorations have been replaced by a
          Thanksgiving display.
          Wearing khakis and a pale blue Oxford, John tentatively walks
          up the front path. The warm sound of LAUGHTER drifts from
          inside. He takes a breath and rings the doorbell.

          It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch
          of counter space is filled with platters of food.
          John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF
          RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving
          feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag.
          John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration --
          things he's never known in his own life. Sarah steps over.
          She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress.

          The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an
          elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last
          turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John.

          bowl of mashed potatoes.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          Don't mind me.
          She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera.

          The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around

          the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag.
          Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings.

          Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for
          good. John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just as

          but as the light bulb sweeps past, he causes it to EXPLODE.

          stairs. John flashes on his palm, casting everything in
          eerie blue light.
          On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon. It's
          almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by
          an invisible force.

          Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big
          man's face. It's like a blinding interrogation lamp.

          John â€œreleasesâ€� Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale
          and is knocked out. At that moment, a razor-thin line of
          dust drops from the floorboards above.

          FOUR MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS stalk through the house. Their long

          bloodhound and motions towards the basement door...

          BLAAAAM! -- the door is shredded off its hinges and flies
          down the stairs. The Mogadorian patrol storms through the
          cloud of splinters. Frank and Bret lie where they fell, but
          there's no sign of John, Henri or Sam.
          Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small
          blacked-out window. He punches out the glass with his fist

          John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog
          unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he
          lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of
          the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in
          the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair.
          As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri
          sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck.

<b>          VRRRROOMMM!

          scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same
          Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin

          Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the

          open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the

</b>          The gym's this way.
          A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of
          lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The
          paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that
          use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One
          FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off
          its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES.
          John spins back and SCREAMS --

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Go! Go! Go!
          They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to
          fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the
          fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a
          projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by
          napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on

<b>          THE SPRINKLER HEADS
</b>          that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing
          the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the
          corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find

<b>          SIX IS WAITING.
</b>          BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range.
          Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting
          hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder.

          Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees
          something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze.

<b>          IT'S THE SECOND PIKEN!
</b>          It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward.
          Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one
          hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to

          icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles
          to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip-
          slides after John and Six, who disappear into...

          CRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off
          the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids
          to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes
          scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen.
          The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off
          its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing
          something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans
          that are stored below.
          REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
          arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes.
          Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken
          pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare
          right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on.

<b>          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Henri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops,

          He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when

<b>          A MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
</b>          steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for
          Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes
          the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right

</b>          Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are
          still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they
          steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug.
          The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of
          sight. It's over in a violent blink.

          Henri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark
          hide in the one opposite. Henri pulls a selection of weapons
          from the backpack. He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark.

          Bernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which

          duo SHATTER-SMASHES into

</b>          Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the

          finally jerks to stillness. As Bernie sinks to the floor, he
          MORPHS back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding...

          John leads the group past the bleachers and points to the
          side of the stage.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          The door's over here. The tunnel
          leads out to the stadium.
          Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
          metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and
          whips the chain free. The doors fly open,

<b>                         TWO MOGADORIANS

          blindsides John. Henri struggles until

          and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks.
          The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony
          and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing

          Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and
          Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! -- three Mogadorian
          knives razor the air. One impales Six in the shoulder. She
          slumps at John's feet. Henri opens FIRE on the

          Sarah glances back at John and follows after them. Henri
          takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and

          Sarah is in the lead. Sam and Mark follow, holding the

<b>                         A MOGADORIAN
</b>          lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's
          hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark looks
          at him in shock as they race through the embers. Sam shrugs.

          Sam, Mark, Six and Sarah hurtle across the field. When they
          reach the track, Sarah looks back and smiles with relief when
          John and Henri burst out of the tunnel.

          John and Henri head onto the field after them when

<b>          THE SECOND PIKEN
</b>          leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's
          seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards John. Its
          fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards
          him. At the last second,

</b>          nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the
          Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and
          flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished,
          as Henri lands in a heap.

          seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood.
          John's face hardens into a mask of rage.

          ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their
          bases and fly skyward.
          ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
          ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth
          open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its
          flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks.
          The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks
          onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red
          life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side.

          Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked
          with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to
          drag him to his feet.

          His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip.
          Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily
          flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face

<b>          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
</b>          But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps
          his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air.
          He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick
          uselessly as he's lifted face to face.

<b>                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER

          The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it.
          John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is

          It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles.
          Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated

          Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes

</b>          As the two teens size each other up, CAMERA FINDS Mark. He
          hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are
          talking intently by the motorcycles. John is now wearing a
          pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          The Sheriff's Department is
          starting to put up roadblocks. You
          guys better get moving.
          Six and Sarah join them.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You good to go?

<b>                         SIX
</b>          Don't worry about me.
          John nods to Sam.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Sam, ride with Six.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          We don't need baggage.
          Sam steps in front of her, determined.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I have to find out if the Mogs took
          my dad.
          Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.

<b>                         SIX
</b>          You slow us down, I'll shoot you
          myself.
          Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I want to come too.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You need to stay here.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          Why?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          You could have died last night.
          I'm not putting you in danger
          again. Mark's promised to look
          after you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          105.
</b>          Tears tumble down her cheeks.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          I don't want to say goodbye.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          I'll come back for you.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>          When?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          When it's safe.
          She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Where I'm from, we only give our
          heart to one person. I've given
          mine to you.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I love you, Sarah.
          Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears
          an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch as

<b>                         BERNIE KOSAR
</b>          limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is
          scratched but he's alive. OFF John's relief...

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. PICNIC AREA - DAY
</b>
          Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle. John holds Bernie as
          he straddles his Harley. Bernie morphs into a gecko and
          darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure.
          John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah.
          He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at
          Mark's side. RAIN spits as the motorcycles start off.

<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          This is the first town I've left
          without Henri. The first one I
          have a reason to come back to.
          John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to
          brand the image of their faces onto their memories.

<b>          EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b>
          The bikes blur past the â€œWelcome to Paradiseâ€� sign.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          106.
</b>
<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          He warned me the pain would be
          unbearable if I left her. He was
          right.

<b>          EXT. TEXAS PLAINS - DAY
</b>
          A straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness.

<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          But I don't regret it. The pain
          reminds me what's at stake.
          A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.

<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          We must find the others and face
          our enemy together. I'm not sure
          how we can stop them. But nothing
          is inevitable. I know that now.
          Thunderheads darken the horizon.

<b>          JOHN (V.O.)
</b>          I am Number 4.
          His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the
          battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future
          unmapped and uncharted. Ready.

<b>          FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>                         THE END
