</b><b>          
</b>          WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his
          modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of
          wine and peering out through the drapes.
<b>          
</b>          After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly
          overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up
          to the house.
<b>          
</b>          Walter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell
          rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass
          down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens
          it.

</b>          She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both
          stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and
          overcompensates with a forced pleasantness.

</b>          Walter starts to play the piano. It's a lesson in progress.
          They are sitting at a beautiful GRAND PIANO but Walter is
          only a beginner. And not a very good beginner.

</b><b>                              BARBARA
</b>                    I said "make room for the train."
                    It's something that I tell my kids.
                    If you curve your fingers like
                    this...
                        (She demonstrates)
                    Then the train can pass through the
                    tunnel.
<b>          
</b>          She passes her pencil through her curved fingers. Walter
          looks at her for a long moment.

</b>                    Well, for what it's worth, it's
                    difficult to learn an instrument at
                    your age. Especially if you don't
                    possess a natural gift for it. I'm
                    not saying this to be mean. But if
                    you do decide to give up then I
                    would really like to buy your
                    piano. It's a beautiful instrument.
<b>          
</b>          Walter nods, not quite sure how to receive the comment.

</b>                    Charles, the truth is this is
                    really Shelley's paper. I just
                    agreed to co-author it because she
                    asked me to. I'm not really
                    prepared to present it.

</b>                    That may be the case but you are
                    the co-author and she can't go.
                    Look Walter, you can take it up
                    with the Dean if you want, but, as
                    your friend, I wouldn't advise it.
                    Not with that argument.

          looks down onto the street.

          street. Zainab's cart tips on the curb and the contents spill
          out onto the sidewalk. Tarek quickly moves to help her.
          Zainab yells at him.

<b>          
</b>          He sits down in the chair next to Tarek's drum. He takes the
          drum between his legs and he hits it a few times.
<b>          
</b>          Then he starts to play. He stops and then he plays again.
          This time he is slightly more successful at finding a rhythm.
          He closes his eyes and bobs his head. He's really getting
          into it.

</b>          He opens his eye's open and Tarek is standing in front of

</b>                    Fear of being deported. It used to
                    be that when your asylum case was
                    denied, they let you go until your
                    appeal. A lot of people didn't
                    bother with it. Getting denied once
                    was enough to spook them.

</b>                    Then there may be a final order of
                    deportation on him which means he
                    won't even go before a judge this
                    time. He'll just be deported.

          bit more barbed wire.

          SODA MACHINES and TWELVE BLUE PLASTIC CHAIRS. In one corner
          is a guard booth with THREE GUARDS. One FEMALE GUARD is
          wearing a Muslim headdress. Walter approaches the window and
          waits in line. The other people waiting comprise a mix of
          nationalities: African, Latin American, Chinese, Indian.
<b>          
</b>          The Guard talks to a MAN in front of Walter. The Man has a

<b>          
</b>          Walter waits for the sliding metal door to open. It does and

          slides open.
<b>

          lawyer consultations.
<b>          
</b>          Walter enters into a large bright room. It resembles a prison
          visitation room. Along the perimeter of the room is a clear
          fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles. Each cubicle
          has one seat and a phone. On the other side of the fiberglass
          is another seat and a phone.

</b>          They each move toward the other and settle into a vacant

<b>          
</b>          Walter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some
          privacy. He watches the various immigrant families speaking

</b>          Walter buys the morning paper from a kiosk. He walks to the
          corner and waits to cross the street. A large group of
          CHINESE TOURISTS led by a TOUR GUIDE step up next to him. He
          is surrounded by them.

          Suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and
          a VERY YOUNG LATIN WOMAN walks out tentatively. She almost
          looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit.

          the glass and talk to him. Walter just stares back, also
          unsure of what to do. They are caught in awkward moment.
          Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is
          the innocent smile of a child.

          the Young Girl back inside. The Young Girl looks at Walter
