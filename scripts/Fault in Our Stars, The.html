          HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at
          the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           You have a choice in this world, I
           believe, about how to tell sad
           stories.

          CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:
          - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS"
          WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
          [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           On the one hand, you can sugar coat
           - the way they do in movies and
           romance novels.

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH
          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.
          She rests her head on his shoulder.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Where villains are vanquished
           and... heroes are born and...
          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... beautiful people learn
           beautiful lessons...

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together.
          They look deep into one another's eyes.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... and nothing is too messed up
           that can't be fixed with an apology
           and a Peter Gabriel song.

          BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
          those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           I like that way as much as the next
           girl, believe me. It's just not the
           truth.

          Hazel closes her eyes.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           This is the truth.
          And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:

</b>          The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Late in the Winter of my 17th
           year...

          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
          help her to breathe.

          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
          grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the
          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
          years before.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... my mother decided I was
           depressed.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm not depressed.

          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
          to the DOCTOR:

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           ... she eats like a bird. She
           barely leaves the house,

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm not depressed.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           ... she reads the same book over
           and over...

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           She's depressed.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm not depressed!

          QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:

           list depression as a side effect of
           cancer...

          - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,
          laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.
          With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.

          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the
          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
          Hazel eyes them with indifference.

<b>                          HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... it's a side effect of dying.

          - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily
          underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter
          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
          - goes back to the book.

          Frannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to
          dangle her feet.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           ... some days she won't even get
           out of bed.
          The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           I may switch you to Zoloft. Or
           Lexapro. And twice a day instead of
           once.

</b>           Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm
           like the Keith Richards of cancer

</b>           Have you been going to that Support

</b>           I'll spare you the gory details of

</b>           Not because I wanted to or because
           I thought it would help. But for
           the same reason I did anything
           these days...
          Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's
          assistance.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... to make my parents happy.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Are you gonna sit here and wait the
           whole time?

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Of course not, no. I...
           (she totally is)
           I have errands to run.
          Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She
          doesn't press the issue.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Ok.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Love you.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Love you too Mom.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           The only thing worse than biting it
           from cancer - is having a kid bite
           it from cancer.
          As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:

<b>           9.
</b>
                         

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Make some friends!
          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT CHURCH - SAME
</b>          Hazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING
          KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'll take the stairs.
          The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could
          always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:

                         

<b>                          GUS HAZEL
</b>          Ooph. Sorry!

                         
          A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).
          Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue
          eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.

<b>                          GUS HAZEL
</b>          My bad. No, it's...

                         
          For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at
          one another. Hazel is speechless.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Excuse me.
          With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,
          Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:

                         

<b>          INT BATHROOM - SAME
</b>          Hazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at
          herself.
          She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The
          Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATER
</b>          Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Who would like to begin?
          No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,
          sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same
          flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away.

<b>           10.
</b>
                         

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Isaac, I know you're facing a
           challenging time. Perhaps you would
           like to say something...
          Isaac nods, rises.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye
           cancer.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           It's looking like another surgery
           in a couple weeks. After which,
           well, I'll be blind...
          Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's
          difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           Not that I'm complaining or
           anything. I know a lot of you have
           it way worse but, still, I mean,
           you know, being blind's gonna
           suck...
          As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from
          Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation
          irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,
          meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.
          A staring contest.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           ...My girlfriend helps. And friends
           like Augustus here...
          Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -
          AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           So... yeah. That's what's up.

<b>           ALL IN UNISON
</b>           "We're here for you Isaac."
          The staring contest continues another few beats until:

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           And does your friend want to speak?
          This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,
          he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up
          as if to say "Victory is mine!" He smiles back at her, the
          most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a
           touch of osteosarcoma bout a year

          Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           But really I'm just here at Isaac's

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           And how are you feeling Augustus?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller
           coaster that only goes up, my
           friend.
          Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops
          smiling and looks away.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Perhaps you'd like to share your
           fears with the group, Augustus.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           My fears?
          Gus thinks about this.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Oblivion.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Oblivion?
          ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Yeah, see... I intend to live an
           extraordinary life. To be
           remembered. If I'm scared of
           anything it's... not doing that.
          Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Would, uh, anyone like to speak to
           that?
          And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Hazel! That's unexpected.
          Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus
          watches her, waits for it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I just wanna say... there will come
           a time when, you know, all of us
           are dead.
          Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.

<b>           12.
</b>
                         

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It might be tomorrow. Might be a
           million years from now but... it's
           gonna happen. And when it does,
           enough generations will come and
           go, there'll be no one left to
           remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or
           Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,
           right?
          The look on Gus's face is unreadable.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oblivion's inevitable. And if that
           scares you, well, I suggest you
           ignore it. God knows it's what
           everyone else does.
          A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,
          not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER
</b>          Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.
          Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a
          redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow
          against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between
          kisses, we can hear:

<b>                          ISAAC MONICA
</b>          Always. Always.

                         
          And Hazel hears:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Literally.
          Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing
          right next to her.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I thought we were in a church
           basement but apparently we were
           literally in the heart of Jesus.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Someone should probably tell him,

           dangerous keeping all these kids

          Gus laughs.

<b>                          GUS

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What?

<b>                          GUS

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Because you're beautiful.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I enjoy looking at beautiful people

           deny myself the simpler pleasures
           of existence. Particularly given

          Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course
          they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
          each other. She hears:

           to each other at least four million
           times this year.
          They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac
          squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.

          pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in
          disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between
          his lips.

           isn't there? And yours is - even

           give money to a corporation for the
           chance to acquire EVEN MORE
           CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so
           well.
          As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on
          his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.

<b>                          HAZEL

</b>           Hamartia?
          Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           A fatal flaw.
          Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still
          etched on his face.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           They don't hurt you unless you

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It's a metaphor. See? You put the
           thing that kills you between your
           teeth. But you don't give it the
           power to do the killing.
          Hazel is floored. And impressed.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Metaphor.
          Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.

<b>                          FRANNIE

          Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as
          anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom.

           (off her confused look)
           I've made plans with Augustus
           Waters.
          And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with
          the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or
          awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT GUS'S CAR - LATER
</b>          Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst
          driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the
          seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck
          snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I failed the test a couple times.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Tell me about it!
          Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           The fourth time I took the test...
           it was going about how this is
           going... and when it was over, the
           instructor looks at me and goes,
           "your driving, while unpleasant...
           is not technically unsafe."

<b>                          HAZEL

<b>                          GUS
</b>           So what happened to you?
          Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but
          somehow this seems different.

</b>           And then stopped working.
          - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe.

          14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any

          the color has returned to her cheeks.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           The antibiotics kicked in. They
           drained the fluid from my lungs.

          He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm

          Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway.

</b>           Nice to meet you!
          They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier
          time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and
          weak lungs.
          Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a
          TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole
          host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school
          trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them.

          Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on

</b>          Hazel at the dinner table with her parents. She's a little
          sullen, barely touching her food.
          Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to
          check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly
          looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her
          eyes bug out. We see:

<b>           24.
</b>
                         
          "Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something."
          Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share
          a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text.
          "Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!"
          Hazel smiles again.
          And then a third text:

<b>          "A BOOK CAN"T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD'S
</b>
<b>          NAME IS THIS MADNESS! AAAAHHHH!"
</b>          Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel
          looks up.

<b>                          MICHAEL

<b>          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

          appears at the base.

           Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is
           coming downstairs.
          Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to
          follow him into the room. Before he does:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the

</b>           You look nice, by the way.
          Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac
          sitting upside down in a gaming chair. Tears are flowing down
          his reddened cheeks. Empty soda cans and bags of junk food
          lie around him.

</b>           How ya doing Isaac?

</b>           "Pain demands to be felt."

          Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another
          howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank
          Isaac. He finally speaks.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           She didn't want to do it after the
           surgery. Said she couldn't handle
           it. I'm about to lose my eyesight
           and she can't handle it.
          Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           I kept saying "always" to her.
           Always, always, always. And she
           just kept talking over me and not
           saying it back. It was like I was
           already gone, you know? "Always"
           was a promise! You can't break
           promises.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Sometimes people don't understand
           the promises they're making when
           they make them.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           Right, sure, but you keep the
           promise anyway. That's what love
           is. Love is keeping the promise
           anyway.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           That could be an "encouragement."
          It's silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny
          look on his face.

<b>           27.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Here we go...
          The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something
          else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it
          against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the
          pillow like a maniac.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           That's it! Punch that thing.
          And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel,
          cigarette dangling from his mouth.

           But there is an unwritten contract
           between author and reader and I
           think ending your book in the
           middle of a sentence kind of
           violates that contract.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           But that's part of what I like
           about it. It portrays death
           truthfully. You die in the middle
           of your life, in the middle of a
           sentence. But I do - God, I do want
           to know what happens to everyone
           else.

</b>           You need to break something.
          Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission.
          Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy
          breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands
          him another.

          Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces.
          Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left
          Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.

<b>                          GUS

          Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm

          enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every
          moment of it.
          - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It's no use.

          Meanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date. She's put
          the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on
          LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs.
          ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           You're a survivor yourself?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           (taps his leg)
           Didn't cut this fella off for the
           hell of it. Though it is an
           excellent weight-loss strategy.
           Legs are heavy!

<b>                          MICHAEL

<b>                          GUS
</b>           N-E-C for fourteen months.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           That's fantastic.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I'm very lucky.
          ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to
          like what she sees a lot more than before.
          BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           Son, you have to understand...
           Hazel's still pretty sick. She will
           be the rest of her life.
          ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what
          she's doing and listens.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           She'll want to keep up with you -

           Are you really?
          Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.

</b>           See this? This circle is virgins...
          Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.

</b>           And this... is 17 year old dudes
           with one leg.
          Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk
          up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the
          ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a
          set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.

          Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this

          along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole

           growth.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           The not so great news is we're
           still seeing serious problems with
           fluid accumulation.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           So how should we proceed?
          Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to
          answer. No one does.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Um, I feel like I'm not the most
           qualified person to answer that.

<b>                          ONCOLOGIST #1
</b>           I was talking to Dr. Simmons.
          DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.

<b>           DR. SIMMONS
</b>           It's a strange case. Normally the
           tumors start resisting the
           treatment. But that hasn't happened
           here - yet.
          Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest.

<b>           DR. SIMMONS
</b>           Unfortunately, the drug may be
           worsening the edema.

<b>           48.
</b>
                         

<b>           DR. MARIA
</b>           But if we stopped it entirely,
           we're likely to face even graver
           dangers.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           So we're gonna do nothing?

<b>           DR. MARIA
</b>           That's what we have to decide. The
           truth is... very few people have
           been on Phalanxifor as long as
           Hazel has. We don't really know the
           long term effects.
          That comforts no one.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Can't I just get like a lung
           transplant or something?
          The Doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that
          one?" Eventually:

<b>           DR. MARIA
</b>           You would not be considered a...
           strong candidate for a transplant.
          Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother
          her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a
          little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.

<b>           DR. SIMMONS
</b>           We're trying to prevent endothelial
           growth while at the same time
           preventing immunosorbent...
          As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,
          Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates
          what she's doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,

          mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:

</b>           (through the tears)
           Are you ready, sweetie?
          13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The
          anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.
          Cause she totally hears her mother say:

<b>          INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM
</b>          Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her
          staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is
          still talking nonsense when:

          When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone. ANGLE ON IT.
          Hazel sends Gus the following text: "STILL FREE MAY 3? :-)"
          A moment later Gus responds: "EVERYTHING'S COMING UP WATERS!"
          Hazel is over the moon with excitement. She smiles, then

          head to the front door, buzzing with excitement.
          As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A
          WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:

          Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure
          what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.
          A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel
          bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.

          Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just
          says, when they stop and look at her:

</b>          They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's
          Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose.
          Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.
          Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.
          She seems determined to get through this without any help.
          But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these
          few steps without oxygen were a struggle.
          Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady
          herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula
          back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and
          focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,
          nervously.

          OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his
          noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment.
          A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.

</b>           Oh that's not necessary.
          But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.
          We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the
          attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.

           give me oxygen and help me breathe.
          The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.

<b>                          HAZEL

          Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it.

          reattaches it.

<b>                          LITTLE GIRL
</b>           Thanks for letting me try it.
          They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to
          her family. She waves. Hazel waves back.

           before?
          Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a
          cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within
          seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.

           doesn't give it the power to kill
           him.

          the arm rest, his eyes wide.

</b>           This is what it feels like to ride
           in a car with you.
          Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out
          the window - they're flying! - and then back to Hazel.

          watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches
          it with gusto.

          Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt

<b>          INT HOTEL ROOM - HOURS LATER

          paisley CHAIR across from the bed reading a TRAVEL GUIDE.

          A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears
          a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...

          An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens
          all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls
          on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto
          the city. Excited. The night just beginning.

          Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.
          The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:

          Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with
          merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them
          and says something in Dutch.

<b>          EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER
</b>
          Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm so excited I can barely
           breathe.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           As opposed to other days...?
          She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen
          tank, and up they go towards his front door.
          As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from
          inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.
          Like, obnoxiously loud.
          Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's
          no response.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Maybe he can't hear over the music?
          Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He
          tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.
          Still excited.
          A moment later the door swings open.
          It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning
          hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS
</b>           What?!
          Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Mr. Van Houten?
          At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.
          Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed
          door, they hear this:

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
</b>
<b>                          (SHOUTING)
</b>
<b>           LEEE-DUH-VIGH!
</b>
<b>           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Are they here, Peter?
          So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
</b>           There are two --

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Who the hell's "they?"

<b>           71.
</b>
                         

<b>           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           They are Augustus and Hazel, the
           young fans with whom you've been
           corresponding.
          Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will
          help things take a turn for the better.

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
</b>           The Americans?

<b>           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           You invited them, remember?

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
</b>           You know why I left America,
           Lidewij? To never have to encounter
           Americans. Get rid of them.
          Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!

<b>           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           I will not do this Peter. Be nice.
          At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose
          voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ
          (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves
          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.
          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,
          two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Which of you is Augustus Waters?
          Gus raises his hand tentatively.
          Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and
          walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Please. I am sorry. Come in.
          Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes
          a step. Hazel follows. They walk:

                         

<b>          INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME
</b>          Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile
          it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single
          couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.
          Van Houten sits in the chair.
          Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and
          twist-tied.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Trash?

<b>           72.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never
           opens it.
          Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
          slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Yours are the first missives to
           which I've replied and look where
           that got me.
          Hazel and Gus take their seats.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Scotch?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Um, no thanks.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Augustus Waters?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It's 11am.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and
           soda.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           She thinks I have a drinking
           problem.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           I also think the Earth is round.
          Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
          to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           So you like my book.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made
           meeting you his Wish so that we
           could come here and talk to you.
          Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Did you dress like her on purpose?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           (looks at her shirt)
           Kinda.

<b>           73.
</b>
                         
          Van Houten says nothing to that.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           I do not have a drinking problem. I
           have a Churchillian relationship
           with alcohol: I can crack jokes and
           govern England and do anything I
           want to do. Except not drink.
          He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Incidentally, thank you for dinner
           last night.

<b>                          HAZEL

           after... the end of your book.
           Specifically to those who Anna
           leaves behind. Like her Mom, the
           Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>
<b>                          (INTERRUPTING)
</b>           How familiar are you with Swedish
           hip-hop?
          Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I would say... limited?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           But presumably you know Afasi Och
           Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Um...

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'
           immediately.

<b>           74.
</b>
                         
          Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds
          later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.
          Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           (yelling over the music)
           I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak
           Swedish.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>
<b>                          (YELLING)
</b>           Who the hell speaks Swedish? The
           important thing is not what
           nonsense the voices are saying, but
           what the voices are feeling.
          The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
          Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Are you messing with us?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Pardon?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Is this some kind of performance?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Rudolf Otto said that if you had
           not encountered the numinous then
           his work was not for you. And I say
           to you, my friends, if you cannot
           hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic
           response to fearfulness, then my
           work is not for you.
          Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all
          this way for this?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           So anyway... when the book ends,
           Anna's mom --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           (raising a hand to silence

<b>                          HER)
</b>           Let us imagine that you are racing
           a tortoise.
          Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly
          feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           The tortoise has a ten yard head
           start. In the time it takes you to
           run ten yards, the tortoise has
           moved maybe one yard. And so on,
           forever.

<b>           VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
</b>           You are faster than the tortoise
           but you can never catch him, you
           see, you can only decrease his
           lead. Now certainly you can run
           past the tortoise as long as you
           don't contemplate the mechanics
           involved but the question of how
           turns out to be so complicated that
           no one really solved it until
           Cantor's proof that some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities.
          Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           I assume that answers your
           questions.

</b>           And yet you seemed so intelligent

           we're here. We... I need you tell

          She rises from the couch.

          Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is
          if to say "come on, enough of this guy." CUT TO:

                         

<b>          EXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAME
</b>          Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As
          they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN

          Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the
          door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.

<b>                          GUS

           I will. Better than any shit that
           drunk could write. With blood and
           guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.
          Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus
          gives her a hug. Afterwards:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I spent your Wish on that asshole.

<b>                          GUS

           world is not a wish-granting
           factory.
          This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes
          outside. Clearly she's been crying too.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           No, there are many stairs. Steep
           stairs.

<b>                          HAZEL

          Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments
          today. They are going inside. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
</b>          A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of
          Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of
          BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of
          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Shall we?
          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So
          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           This is the bookcase that hid the
           Frank family and four others.
          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set
          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.

<b>           80.
</b>
                         
          Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks
          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the
          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen
          tank.
          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored
          breathing the entire time.
          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.
          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.
          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's
          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall
          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You're a champion.
          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the
          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more
          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this
          he looks at Hazel:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           That's enough --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>
<b>                          (RESOLUTE)
</b>           I'm ok.
          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her
          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.
          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
          herself through.
          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the
          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           We're at the top. That's it.
          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.
          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.
          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.
          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing
          their story.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           The only member of the whole family
           to survive was Otto, Anne's father.
          Gus takes Hazel's hand.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           I don't know how you go on, without
           your family.

<b>           81.
</b>
                         
          Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads
          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO
          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear
          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.
          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the
          same. The room is dark.

<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           "At such moment's, I don't think
           about the misery..."
          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the
          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.

<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           "...but about the beauty that still
           remains."
          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she
          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.
          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...

<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           "Try to recapture the happiness
           within yourself. Think of all the
           beauty in everything around you...
           and be happy."
          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-
          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've
          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a
          small eternity.
          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly
          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,
          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...
          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the
          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes,
          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
</b>          They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the
          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It's above my knee.
          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It tapers a little and then it's
           just skin --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What?

<b>           82.
</b>
                         
          Hazel pulls away from him.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           My leg.

<b>                          (BEAT)

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh get over yourself.
          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off
          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure
          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They
          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I love you, Augustus Waters.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I love you too, Hazel Grace.
          They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
</b>          Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she
          isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.
          It reads: "Dearest Augustus..."
          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled "Virgins." And in that
          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled "17 year old dudes
          with one leg." We'll notice part of that circle is now
          outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.

                         

<b>          EXT CAFE - DAY

<b>                          HAZEL

          Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it
          in check in front of her Mother.

<b>                          FRANNIE

          As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and
          Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie
          has left them:

<b>                          HAZEL

          sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling
          with something.

           hospital... There was this... I
           felt this... ache in my hip.
          Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh no...
          Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth
          tightly, trying not to cry.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I had a PET scan.

          Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next
          to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door,
          and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and

           I am not a mathematician, but I
           know this: there are infinite

           numbers between 0 and 2, or between
           0 and a million. Some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities. A
           writer we used to like taught us

          Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only
          confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents
          embrace her in the bed.

<b>          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAME
</b>          Hazel sits in the car in the dark. She's blaring the loudest
          music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the
          horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           One of the first things they ask
           you in the ER is to rate your pain
           on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been
           asked this question hundreds of
           times and I remember once, early
           on, when I couldn't catch my breath
           and it felt like my chest was on
           fire, and the nurse asked me to
           rate the pain and though I couldn't
           speak, I held up 9 fingers.
          The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.
          She falls apart nonetheless.

</b>           Later on, when I'd been feeling

           I know," she said. "Because you

          family and extend their deepest condolences.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           He loved you so much too.
          More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in
          the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's
          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
          breath, wills herself to walk towards it.
          Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.
          Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches
          herself.

</b>           It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.
          She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.
          Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights
          and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of
          the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.

<b>                          MINISTER

          Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in
          the middle of the room.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>           Augustus Waters fought hard for

</b>           What a load of shit, eh kid?
          Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She
          turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.

<b>           106.

          Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps
          staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           We need to fake pray now.
          Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns
          back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected
          appearance.

<b>                          MINISTER

          Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.
          Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really
          him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.

</b>           Of all the things I've lost in my

          And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or
          if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister
          walks back up.

<b>                          MINISTER

<b>                          HAZEL

          Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.

          Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the
          burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Could I hitch a ride?
          Hazel doesn't want to help this man.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Just to the bottom of the hill.
          Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           How did you even --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           The internet.

<b>                          HAZEL

</b>           The drinks are free drinks in First
           Class.
          Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a
          swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Omnis Cellula e cellula.
          Hazel ignores him.

</b>           I would hardly call him a fan. He
           despised me. But he was quite
           insistent I attend his funeral and
           tell you what became of Anna and

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           She was eight, my daughter. She
           suffered... beautifully. For so
           long.
          Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           She had leukemia? Like Anna?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Just like her, yes.

<b>                          HAZEL

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Not when she died, no. I was
           insufferable long before Anna, my
           dear. Grief doesn't change you,
           Hazel, it reveals you.
          Hazel takes that in.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Well I'm sorry for your loss.

</b>           Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You
           asked me to tell you what happens
           and I wish I could do that. I wish
           that I could. But I can't. No one
           can. No one knows, Hazel. They
           don't talk to us. Unless...
          Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to
          Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           You think I care about that? I
           don't give a shit, Van Houten.
          Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.

          Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told,
          stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands
          there as Hazel peels out.
          In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if
          toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>          Hazel lies in front of the TV. "Top Model" is playing but
          she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she
          can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.

                         

<b>          INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

<b>           MICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>           Can I come in?
          Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down
          next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.
          Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.
          Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry.

<b>                          MICHAEL

          Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.

          Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws

          in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to
          give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath
          the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and
          unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:

           We'd make a good team. I don't want
           to ask you any favors but if you
           have the time, and from what I saw
           you have plenty, please fix this
           for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.
          Hazel is overcome with emotion.

</b>           She asked me to write one and I'm
           trying, I just, I could use a
           little flair. See the thing is...
           we all want to be remembered.
          She smiles to herself, remembering:
          - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.
          - The staring contest in Support Group.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE

           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't
           want a million admirers, she just
           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe

          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE

           without ever being mean.

<b>                         SHE REMEMBERS:

          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we
          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make
          these images less beautiful. They make them twice as
