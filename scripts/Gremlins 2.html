<b>          1 EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - MORNING 1
</b>
          The same crowded Chinatown street where Rand Peltzer first
          found Gizmo the Mogwai. As LOCALS bustle past, ANGLE FAVORS
          the stairs to the basement curiosity shop.

<b>          2 INT. MR. WING'S STORE
</b>
          MR. WING, the storekeeper who took Gizmo home after the
          Gremlins' night of carnage, opens the door, beginning his day.
          As he lights his pipe, he HEARS a commotion upstairs.

<b>          3 EXT. STREET 3
</b>
           PEDESTRIANS dodge a long black LIMOUSINE as it pulls up short.
           ANGLE reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed
           -- GOING OUT OF BUSINESS signs and boarded-up windows.
           FORSTER, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the 
           limo, followed by three beefy MEN, also in suits. The three
           big men take a big-screen TV VT and a VCR out of the car.
           INT. MR. WING'S STORE tj.
           Mr. Wing looks up from ' hers game as the four men sweep
           into the store.

           Mister Wi Daniel Clamp would
           like to see you.

           The men quickly set up the big-screen TV set and VCR. One of
          the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen
          fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New
          York's most successful real estate developer.

<b>          CLAMP (ON TV)
</b>          Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's
          out through to key issues, okay?
          I'm prepared to increase my offer
          substantially.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Now, Mister Wing, you're attached
          to your business. I appreciate
          that. I'm attached to my own
          business. I develop the biggest
          buildings in New York, and you
          sell, ah, little things. Fine.
          But I'm not just talking about
          money here.
          On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE widens to incim a an easel
          beside Clam , holding an architect's RENDER that shows the
          grandiose of a huge office building,..

          When I put up a building, it's the
          biggest -- it's the newest -- it's
          the best. People are going to be
          killing each other to get into
          this building --
          The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove
          of the store.

           Mr. Wing regards the video image impassively. 


<b>           CLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.)
</b>           Please IF us know when you've 
          made a decision, Mister Wing. You
          know, I believe that there's
          always an area of agreement that
          two people can reach.
           The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized "C" -- fills the 
          wereen, replacing Clamp's image.

<b>          MR. WING
</b>          Yes -- a man can always agree with
          others. It is more difficult to
          agree with oneself.

<b>          FORSTER
</b>           Does that mean you -- 
          He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that
          sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he
          answers Forster.

<b>      
</b>
<b>          MR. WING
</b>          I'm sorry. Please tell Mister
          Clamp that the answer is no.

<b>          FORSTER
</b>          Keep the TV.
          As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the
          TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to
          change the TV CHANNEL.
          With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE
          from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie

          Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an
          arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a
          HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES.

<b>          GIZMO (0.3.)
</b>          Neat!

          But as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and
          angrily turns the TV set OFF, addressing the unseen Gizmo.

          it in shock as he gets a GLIMPSE of a growth-hormone
          experiment: a hairy SPIDEbout twelve inches across.
          Then, as Gizmo's singin news, Billy's eyes fall on the right
          covered cage -- and theeaming SCALPELS arranged next to it.
          Billy heads back to the copying machine. On the way, he flips
          the latch on the monkeys' cage --
          -- and is back at the copier in time to look up, "surprised,"
          as the excited monkeys scamper past his into the center of the
          lab, distracting the scientists --

          hard to say which of then is more excited.
          But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo
          into his toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier
          a mess.

          A JANITOR, pushing a cart of cleaning supplies, comes into the
          office area. Gizmo, on the floor, peeks around a corner to
          watch as the cart's wheels rumble past him.
          As SEEN by Gizmo, the towering janitor stops at the department's
          WATER FOUNTAIN and tries to get a drink. The fountain's spigot
          OVERSHOOTS, giving the janitor a SPLASH in the face.
          Gizmo inches away from the source of the water, and -- seeing a
          puddle on the carpet where the water landed -- carefully avoids
          it. He keeps moving, and evades a second ARC of errant water
          from the fountain.
          The janitor decides t )gx,the fountain. Attacking the spigot
           with a wrench, he sends off 1morq STREAMS of water. To duck
          0 them, Gizmo takes cover, back, isu; under Billy's desk...
          .and doesn't see a big SPLASH F'o }wezï¿½ hit Billy's Chinatown
          picture. While Gizmo, thinking the danger is passed, steps out
          from under the desk, the bright colors of Billy's painting blur,
          and the blob of water ROLLS DOWN the illustration board...
          .down the side of the desk...
          Gizmo looks up, but too late. From his POV, the blob of paint-
          tinted water is huge, and coming down fast. It HITS him --
          -- and, as the janitor's feet and the wheels of his cart pass in
          â‚¬.g., CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo on the floor, writhing in pain. The
          janitor leaves, and Gizmo SCREAMS, as -- THWIP! THWIP! -- two
          tiny FURBALLS shoot out of his body and land in the open DRAWER
          of a nearby filing cabinet.
          THWIP! The painful Mogwai replication continues, and a third
          furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket.
          THWIP! The fourth and final offspring shoots from Gizmo's body,
          and -- as Gizmo watches in horror and pain -- BOUNCES crazily
          around the office area, a little Superball of fur.
          As Gizmo sits up and looks up, we watch with him -- four newborn
          Mogwai HANDS reach out of the filing cabinet drawer, gripping

<b>          S
</b>          the top edge from inside.

          Mogwais are revealed, standing in the drawer: GEORGE AND LENNY,
          an inseparable pair. Lenny is big, dumb, and loyal, while
          George is small, with a criminal caginess -- he gets Lenny to do
          everything for him.
          Gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed
          start to ROCK back and forth -- but is distracted as the
          BOUNCING FURBALL hits the floor in front of him, then ricochets
          up onto a DESKTOP.
          To SOUND FX of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball
          rolls into a desk corner, and the third Mogwai unfolds --
          upside-down. This is DAFFY, a dizzy, uncontrollably antic
          Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de vivre we associate
          with the great Daffy Duck.
          In the first seconds following birth, Daffy goes daffy over the
          very fact of being alive. He sees his little hands and feet
          unfold,. and gives a WHOOP

          pure, malicious evil, a new strain of badness. Even as a furry
          Mogwai, he's about as cuddly as a cockroach.

          Gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. There's a grated VENT
          opening low on the wall behind him.
          Lenny grabs Gizmo with a fast-moving paw, and Mohawk, moving in
          close, SPITS in Gizmo's eyes.

          Kate has put Daffy on the kitchen counter. Nearby, she unwraps
          some Kentucky Fried Chicken. On the counter, SPOT a few of
          Rand Peltzer's seldom-used kitchen INVENTIONS.

<b>          KATE
</b>          Billy said to make sure and feed
          you before midnight...
          As she arranges chicken and mashed potatoes on a plate, Daffy
          spots a BLENDER next to him. He recoils from it -- then, with
          an evil grin, he shoves it off the counter while Kate's back is
          turned, BREAKING it. When she turns and looks, Daffy has an
          innocent loops" expression on his face.

<b>          KATE
</b>          Oh, God-you have to be careful
          here, okay, Gizmo? We don't have

          Brown's, clamps 0 -11 n the drumstick, and strips all the meat
          off in one fast ion, bringing out a spotless bone.
          With his other paw, Daffy tries the mashed potatoes. He hates
          them, and PITCHES what he's holding, getting half the wad on
          Kate and half on the refrigerator.

          but his dopey face still recognizable -- sits up in the soup

          backs out of the room.
          As the tourists go, the Gremlins turn savagely toward the ovens.
          George whispers to Lenny, who nods obediently and throws several
          METAL UTENSILS into the microwaves. The Gremlins close the
          ovens and start them up. The ovens fill with furious ARCS of

          The flames lick up toward the ceiling --
          -- and set off the SPRINKLERS. George and Lenny grin, standing
          tall to shower in the spray. As the water hits, BUBBLES appear
          on the Gremlins' backs. Close on the bubbles, CAMERA finds the
          tiny heads of GREMLIN OFFSPRING, getting ready to burst out.
          As the studio fills with the ominous SMOKE and COLORED LIGHT of
          Gremlin multiplication, Kate runs from the room.

          As the letter turns into paper spaghetti, the secretary leaves

          water at Clamp --
          -- who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him.
          Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the
          empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the
          wall.
          The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his
          face, like a kid panicked by a moth --
          -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is

          In the same Xerox room where he was tormented with the copying
          machine and the rubber cement, Gizmo is undergoing his worst
          torture yet at the hands of George and Mohawk, who have lit
          CENSERS and put on Inquisition-style ROBES for the occasion.
          The defenseless Gizmo is TIED with heavy twine to the top of a
          paper-cutting TABLE. Above him, George hangs by one arm from a
          high SHELF. In his other claw, George holds a PENDULUM rigged
          up from a T-square, a protractor, rubber bands...

          pendulum, the knife blade moves closer to Gizmo's chest, a
          fraction of an inch each time.
          Pacing back and forth on the floor below, Mohawk CACKLES at
          Gizmo's dilemma. Like a villain swilling whiskey, he gulps from
          the vial he stole in the genetics lab, the one with the spider
          logo on it.
          The blade moves closer-grazing Gizmo's fur...but as it
          SLICES the topmost fibers of the twine that holds him
          down --
           -- a CHANGE comes over Gizmo's expression. This is one Mogwai
           who's had enough. He sets his jaw in angry determination, and
           BURSTS the frayed twine, freeing one arm -- then another --
           George grabs the T-square like a scythe, and tries to hack at
          Gizmo with the knife blade --
          -- but Gizmo GRABS the pendulum and PULLS down hard, so that
          George TUMBLES from his shelf --

          In a dimmed conference room high up in the building, Forster
          backs fearfully toward a wall...
          .and the GIRL GREMLIN, dressed in a BRIDAL OUTFIT, moves
          slowly across the floor toward him, with what she imagines is
          great seductiveness. The Girl Gremlin saucily undoes a button
          or two...
          .Forster tries to melt into the wall...
          ...and we discreetly BLACK OUT, under END CREDITS.
