           me by embezzling money from the
           local high school, which wasn't
           true. It was a delusion. And we

           happened and that's when everything
           snapped, so I then realized that,
           oh, wow, I've been dealing with

</b>           Let me just set the record straight
           about last night. Hurting my mother
           was a mistake and I hate myself for
           it, and I hate my illness and I
           want to control it. My father, on
           the other hand, had no trouble
           slapping the shit out of me last
           night, which I did not return
           `cause I could've killed him and I
           didn't. He's sixty-five years old.
           You don't think I could've beat the
           shit out of him? I mean....

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>           He was scared for your mother and
           you hurt him as well.

<b>                          PAT
</b>           Yes, last night was a mess. Okay?
           And I think he probably just tried
           to do his best.

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>           Pat, you have to have a strategy. I
           told you earlier. You need to
           recognize these feelings coming to
           you, otherwise you will be sent
           back to Baltimore. So when you get
           these feelings, you need to get to
           a quieter place, and be at peace
           with yourself, however you can.

<b>                          PAT
</b>           Yeah, but that's easier said than
           done.

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>           You have to do it. You have no
           choice. Excelsior.

<b>                          PAT
</b>           Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a

           okay?

</b>

<b>                          PAT
</b>          Oh, I don't know, because I'm
          married and I haven't seen my wife
          in eight and a half months?

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>          Maybe you think that Nikki's not
          around and Tiffany's an attractive
          girl and if you get drawn towards
          Tiffany, you will spoil your

          think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki
          because Tiffany's a slut.

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>          Why is she a slut?

<b>                          PAT
</b>          After the dinner at Ronnie's, she
          said, quote, "We can go to the back
          house and you can fuck me as long
          as we turn the lights out."
          Unquote. And she still wears her
          wedding ring. So she's a loyal,
          married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>          Maybe she just needs a friend and
          she thought if she offers you sex,
          it will be easier for you to become
          friends with her.

<b>                          PAT
</b>          She said she's not a whore anymore,
          but she likes that part of herself
          along with all the other parts of
          herself and can I say the same?

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>          Can you?

<b>           65.
</b>
                         

<b>                          PAT
</b>           Is that....? You're asking me,
           you're really asking me that
           question?

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>           Yes.

<b>                          PAT
</b>           With all my crazy sad shit? What,
           are you fucking nuts?

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>           Pat, the silver lining thing is
           yours. I'm just giving back your
           words to you. This "crazy sad
           shit," as you call it, made you a
           happier, calmer person with a
           beautiful positive philosophy of
           going outdoors, working out, and
           reading books.

<b>                          PAT
</b>           No, not the books.

<b>           DR. PATEL
</b>           You said Nikki's friends with
           Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if
           you become friends with Tiffany,
           Nikki will think that you're a
           kind, generous, large-hearted
           person, who helps people in need,
           who is basically thriving. So if
           you help Tiffany, it will be good
           for you.

           the last couple months, I just
           wasn't into sex at all. It just
           felt like we were so different and
           I was depressed. Some of that is
           just me, some of it was he wanted
           me to have kids and I have a hard
           enough time taking care of myself.
           I don't think that makes me a
           criminal. Anyway one night after
           dinner, he drove to Victoria's
           Secret at King of Prussia Mall and
           got some lingerie to get something
           going. And on the way back, he
           stopped on 76 to help a guy with a
           flat tire and he got hit by a car
           and killed. And the Victoria's
           Secret box was still in the front
           seat. (pause) That's a feeling.

           shit on my time. I can tell you all
           about the "Lord of the Flies." It's
           a bunch of boys on an island and
           they have a conch -- they have a
           shell -- and whoever has the conch
           has the power and they can talk.
           And if you don't have the conch,
           then you don't have the power. And
           then there's a little chubby boy,
           and they call him Piggy and they're
           really mean, and then there's a
           murder. I mean, humanity is just
           nasty and there's no silver lining.

           think it's ridiculous to bet all

</b>           Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you
           heard what I said. It's like a

           about a project, and we have a very
           important part of it that we have
           to go over on Sunday, and it's good
           for me, Dad. It's making me
           disciplined and focused, and it's,

</b>           "Dear Pat, It was very emotional
           for me to get your letter, as I'm
           sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
           you took the risk of discreetly
           getting it to me through Tiffany.
           This gives us a chance to
           communicate while I keep the
           restraining order until I feel
           safe. I must admit you sound
           terrific and I'm happy that you are
           feeling so positive and becoming a
           more loving and caring man, which I
           always knew you were. I was moved
           to read about `Excelsior' and your
           belief in happy endings. I am also
           moved by your act of love to read
           the books I have taught at the high
           school. I'm sorry you find them so
           negative, but I disagree. I think
           they are great works of art that
           reflect how hard life can be and
           they can also help kids prepare
           themselves for the hardness of
           life. In spite of all these
           positive developments, Pat, I have
           to say if it's me reading the
           signs, I need to see something to
           prove you are ready to resume our
           marriage. Otherwise I find myself
           thinking that we might both be
           better off moving on with our lives
           separately. Please don't react
           quickly to this, but take time to
           think about it. I'm glad you're
           doing so well. Love, Nikki."
