<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
               Inside a closet.

               It is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light 
               cutting down through the center of the darkness.

               As we begin to descend, voices echo in our head.

</b>                         I had this image of you, inside of 
                         me, like a part of me.

               We move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags.  It 
               is a woman's closet.

<b>                                     CORKY (V.O.)
</b>                         You planned this whole thing, didn't 
                         you?

<b>                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
</b>                         Where's the fucking money?

               We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to 
               feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to 
               the racks of high heels.

<b>                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
</b>                         We make our own choices, we pay our 
                         own prices.

<b>                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
</b>                         All part of the business.

<b>                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
</b>                         All part of the business.

<b>                                     CORKY (V.O.)
</b>                         What choice?

               We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and 
               reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black 
               Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.

<b>                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
</b>                         I want out.

               We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, 
               lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling 
               tightly around her wrists.

               The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face.  She is 
               gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her 
               forehead.  Her name is CORKY.

<b>                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
</b>                         Like a part of me.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
               Leaning against the back of the elevator is Corky, a very 
               butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather 
               jacket.  She is a lesbian and wants people to know it.

               As the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Wait!  Hold the elevator.

               Corky pushes the "open" button.  A couple steps into the 
               elevator.  His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing 
               an expensive suit and sunglasses.

               She is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in 
               your mouth.

               She hears it again, a guttural sound.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Thanks again for this opportunity, 
                         Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye.

               She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall.

               As she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against 
               the wall.

               The man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally 
               it swells --

<b>                                                           DISSOLVING INTO:
</b>
<b>               INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
               The whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod.

               The spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub 
               drain, black goo splattering everywhere.

               The machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone 
               pounding on the apartment door.

               Killing the motor, she stands and goes to the door.

               Behind the door is Violet, wearing jeans, a white T-shirt 
               and cowboy boots.

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of 
                         met in the elevator --

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         I heard you working in here and I 
                         just wondered if you'd like a cup of 
                         coffee?

               She is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute.

               Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to 
               wash off the drain dreck.

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         What happened to Rajeev?

               Corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Who?

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         Rajeev, the man who usually works on 
                         the building.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Oh, he went home to India, but as 
                         far as I know he'll be back.

               She wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main 
               room.

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         So this is temporary for you?

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Pretty much.  One day at a time.

               Violet hands her the cup of black coffee.

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         I guessed you were straight black.

</b>                         Good guess.

               They both sip from the piping hot mugs.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.

</b>                         My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I 
                         did have a slightly ulterior motive 
                         here.  I was wondering if I could 
                         ask a small favor?

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         A favor?

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, 
                         so I was wondering if it wasn't a 
                         terrible inconvenience if you could 
                         wait a bit before using power tools.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Oh, I'm sorry --

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         No, it isn't your fault.  The walls 
                         here are just so thin.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Are they really?

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         Yes, it really causes problems.  
                         Sometimes it's like you're in the 
                         same room.  But if it's too much 
                         trouble, I understand ...

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         No, no trouble.  There's other work 
                         to do.

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         You're doing everything yourself?

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Yeah.

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of 
                         people who can fix things.  My dad 
                         was like that.  We never had anything 
                         new.  Whenever something broke he 
                         would open it up, tinker with it and 
                         it would work.  His hands were magic.

               She looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug.

                         years old.

               Corky smiles.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Truck.

</b>                         So, how do you know the owner, Mr.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         I don't, really.  I was referred to 
                         him.

</b>                         Oh, really.

               Corky suddenly feels she has revealed something.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         Do you know him?

                         kind.

               Smiling, she says nothing else.

<b>                                     VIOLET
</b>                         I should be going.  You can drop the 
                         cup off anytime.

               CORKY watches her leave.

<b>               EXT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT
</b>
               A dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon-
               white sign the only evidence it exists.

               Corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of 
               large motorcycles.  She flips her collar and heads for the 
               door.

<b>               INT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

               The smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corky's nose 
               as she crosses to the bar.

               Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over.

                         How you doing, Sue?

               Corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it.

<b>                                     SUE

                         up, how about a drink?

               Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles.

               They click the bottles together and drink.

                         narrow.  I'm just here to get laid 
                         or drunk and hopefully both.

               Corky gets off the stool.

</b>                         Thanks for the beer.

               Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back 
               tables.  Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance 
               to Violet.

               The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket.

               Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her.  There is 
               no one smoother.

                         great on my bedroom floor.

               The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder.

               She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman 
               in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket.  She is more wide 
               than fat.

               Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips.  A service 
               revolver is clipped to her belt.

               She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition.

               Corky smiles at the woman in black.

               She heads for the exit.

<b>               EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT 
</b>
               The neighborhood would be politely described as "rough." 
               Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered 
               street.

<b>               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               It is a hole but it is home.

               Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a 
               beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons 
               from the radio.

               We see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small 
               desk lamp.  We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up 
               the screen until there is nothing but the white light.

               Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a 
               swath across the ceiling.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY  
</b>
               Corky is painting the ceiling.  The folk ballad has become 
               an angry Riot Grrrl anthem.

               She is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth.  
               Sweat covers her face.

               Dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when 
               the phone rings.  She stops and answers it.

                         yes, everything is going fine.  I 
                         got the tub drain all cleaned out.

               She listens for a moment.

               She glances at the main wall.

</b>                         All right, all right, I guess I could

                         goodbye.

               She hangs up and looks again at the wall, feeling...  curious.

<b>               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Corky knocks and after a moment Violet opens the door.  She 
               seems surprised.

                         so I called Mr. Bianchinni.

               She steps back and Corky walks inside.

<b>               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Violet leads her through the apartment.  It is expensively 
               furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black 
               leather.

                         I pulled the stopper my earring fell 
                         in.

               Corky looks at her blankly.

                         why I got upset.  I know it probably 
                         seems ridiculous to you.

               An eyebrow goes up.

</b>                         I told Bianchinni I would take a 
                         look.  Is it that sink?

               Violet nods.

               She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel 
               locks from her back pocket.  The teeth of the channel locks 
               open and bite onto the pressure nut.

</b>                         Sure.

               She hands one down to her.  Corky slides it under the curved 
               pipe.

               As she works, Corky feels herself staring at Violet, at the 
               hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs.

               Water begins to trickle into the pan.

               The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap.  Water splashes 
               into the pan with a soft metal "tink."

               Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring.

               Violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half-falling as 
               she tries to hug Corky.

               Corky leans back under and replaces the trap.

                         it.  I did it.

               Corky checks the drain by running the water.

                         work all night.

               Corky eyes her for a moment.

               Corky sits on the black leather couch and Violet returns 
               with two bottles of Heineken.  Corky sneers.

               They clink the bottles and swig.

               She looks at Violet, then takes another long pull on the 
               bottle.

               Violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her.

               Violet notices the tattoo on Corky's arm.

               Corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is.  She nods, 
               rubbing it as if trying to hide it.

               She moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she 
               opens the front of her dress.

               Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright 
               green-stemmed violet.

                         was sore for a long time after.  I 
                         couldn't even touch it.

               Corky looks up from Violet's breast to her dark eyes.

               She runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin.

               Corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet takes 
               her hand and places it on her breast.

               Corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb 
               presses into Violet's nipple.

               Inhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Corky 
               staring at her.

               Corky's forearm flexes and Violet moans.

               With both hands, Violet takes hold of Corky's forearm.

               Violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe.

               Now it is Corky who smiles.

               Violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against 
               Corky's hand.

</b>                         ...  kiss me.

               In a single motion, Corky takes hold of the back of her neck 
               and covers Violet's open mouth with her own.

               With her hand still stuffed between Violet's legs, Corky 
               lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more --

               More desperate, more hungry until --

               We hear the front door unlock and open.

               He comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two

               He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of 
               money and peels several hundreds.  Corky stares at it.

               Close on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and 
               separating the black bristles under the running water.

               When the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the 
               edge.

               She goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops, 
               noticing her left hand.

               It is the hand that was between Violet's legs.

               She is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in 
               the mirror.

               It is late, the area burnished with amber street light.  
               Corky walks from the building to her truck.

               She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when 
               suddenly the passenger door opens and --

               Violet gets in.  Stunned, Corky stares at her.

               She kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't 
               tell.

               The windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting, 
               breaks the kiss.

               The sex.

               There is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about it.

               It is sweaty, slippery, body-grinding, bed-squeaking lesbian 
               sex --

               Pungent and potent --

               And when it is over, neither woman can move.

               Finally, Corky's eyes flutter open.

               Violet smiles.

               Slowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge.  She grabs a 
               beer and presses it to her sweating forebead.

               After a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can 
               elsewhere.  Eyes closed, she lets out a long "Ahh."

               Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to 
               the bed.

               She holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can, 
               watching Violet's throat as she drinks.

               Violet's eyes open.

                         time for getting caught.  She was 
                         always more honest than me.

               Corky sips her beer.

</b>                         I started stealing when I was little.  
                         We were piss-poor, which is not an 
                         excuse, just a fact.

               It isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone 
               she just met.

                         A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's 
                         Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was 
                         a mean old prick, always worrying 
                         about us robbing him, dropped a roll 
                         of quarters.

               We can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor.

</b>                         I can still hear that sound, those 
                         quarters, because right then something 
                         clicked inside of me.  Some instinct 
                         took over and as everyone, including 
                         Waxman, dove down, I reached up and 
                         emptied the cash register.

               Violet smiles.  She likes this woman.

                         I told her I found it at the

                         cried, calling me her lucky charm.  
                         Fifteen years later, I guess my luck 
                         ran out.

                         surviving.  Usually I can admit that's

               Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools.  Grinning 
               like someone who has been well-laid, she whistles off to 
               work.

<b>               EXT. LOBBY - DAY

               Between the main doors she sees a man.  His name is SHELLY 
               and he is an overdressed accountant.

               He is very nervous, talking to someone through the intercom.

               Fiddling with her keys, Corky recognizes the voice that 
               answers him.

               Shelly glances over his shoulder at Corky, answering in a 
               hushed voice.

               I have to leave.  Tonight.

               For a moment the intercom is silent.  Then the door buzzes 
               and Shelly pushes inside.  Corky follows him to the elevator.

               Corky glares at Shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her 
               circular saw.

               Shelly hides behind his sunglasses, watching the elevator 
               numbers go up.  The doors open and he scurries out.

               She watches him enter Caesar's apartment, her smile now

               It is later.  Through the wall we listen to the same sound 
               as before of two people making love.  We drop down and find 
               Corky's brush, still wet with paint, abandoned in her tray.

               Her face glistening with sweat, Violet climaxes, letting the

               As she opens her eyes, we see that her lover is Corky.  Violet 
               watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed.

               Corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on.  Violet 
               sits up.  She can feel that something is wrong.

               Corky climbs out of the cab and into the back, unhooking the 
               bungee cords that hold down the boxes.

               She looks up as a black Lincoln Town Car screeches into a

               apartment.

               She listens - a rising string of warbling sobs drowned out

               With each thud the water in the toilet shimmers like a struck 
               cymbal.  As we move closer, the sound swells until --

               The angry voice belongs to JOHNNIE MARZZONE.  Shelly is 
               kneeling in front of the toilet, hands tied behind his back 
               with electrical wire.

               Johnnie Marzzone is a flashy young man in Armani slacks, 
               silk shirt and silver-tipped cowboy boots.  His tie is tucked 
               in, as if torture were a fine-dining experience.

               Caesar and two other men are crammed in the small bathroom.

               Shelly screams as Jobnnie repeatedly rams his face into the 
               toilet.

               Like Corky, Violet can hear the beating.  She is trying to 
               block it out but cannot.

               Standing at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes, 
               trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom.

               The bathroom door opens.

               Caesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind

               He embraces her.  Over his shoulder she sees MICKEY MALNANO 
               in the hallway, staring at her.

               He is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug.  
               Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit.

               Mickey continues to stare at Violet, who looks up at him 
               with her big doe eyes.

               He goes to the kitchen.

               Mickey moves closer to Violet, lifting her chin the way a

               Caesar returns from the kitchen.  He is holding a pair of 
               tin snips.  Mickey takes them.

</b>                         Thanks, C.  Now let's end this thing.

               Violet watches them return to the bathroom.

               Mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named 
               LOU.  He slaps Johnnie on the back.

<b>                                     MICKEY
</b>                         Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay.

               Johnnie hits Shelly once more.

               Johnnie checks his hair in the mirror, carefully.  Then he 
               begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating.

               Mickey kneels down next to Shelly's ear and motions to Lou, 
               who lifts Shelly's bound arms.

                         times.  You understand?  Ten times.

               Mickey grabs Shelly's pinky finger, putting it between the 
               metal blades.

               Shelly whimpers, red-faced and sobbing.  There is a sick 
               crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger 
               bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear.

               We hear Caesar retrieve a tissue and his hand enters the 
               frame, scooping up the pinky.

               He plunks the severed finger into the toilet and it sinks to 
               the bottom.

               Caesar drops the toilet seat down and flushes.

               Corky can't stand it anymore.  She throws her tools down, 
               leaves the bathroom and finds --

               Violet waiting in the main room.  Both women stand apart in 
               silence.

               Violet seems on the verge of saying something but doesn't 
               know how to start.  Her lip begins to quiver; her eyes search 
               the room, returning to Corky each time.

               The violence in the next room can still be heard.

               Almost unnoticeably, Violet shakes her bead.  Corky puts her

               It is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the afternoon.  
               Dark wood and padded leather.

               The bartender, joking with a cluster of men, does not notice 
               Corky as she moves up to the bar.

               Corky eyes the men, who stare into their drinks.

               The bartender says nothing as he puts the drinks in front of 
               her.

               Corky heads for her table, ignoring the whispers and snickers.

               Corky and Violet, the only women in the room, sit close 
               together at a far corner table.

               Violet's voice is hushed.

                         have run at any time, but he didn't

               Through the back window of the truck, Violet and Corky are 
               silhouettes against the street light.

               Violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open, 
               Caesar charging in.  He is doubled over, clutching something 
               to his stomach.

               He rushes to the kitchen, dumping a bloody bundle into the 
               double sink.  There is blood everywhere, smeared up and down 
               Caesar's front.

                         if this is even all of it.

               Caesar is exasperated.

               do not move from the pile of money.

               jerk against their bonds.

               As if in a dream, she struggles, trying to get free, fighting 
               toward the edge of consciousness until --

               She seems to succumb, slipping back into stillness.

               Violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee.

               Working furiously at the computer, Caesar jumps when he sees 
               her, bloodshot eyes animal-wide.

               He checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him.

               He nods automatically, back in his work, as she sees the 
               briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds.

               Caesar is working intensely on his fingernails.  We glide 
               over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools.  We see his 
               hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a 
               nail.

               Through the open door, we see Corky moving almost casually 
               across the living room.

               She finds a black duffel bag from one of her tool buckets.

               Corky slips her hand in between the mattress and box spring, 
               pulling out a gun.

               She tosses the gun on the bed.

               The black case is lying on the desk, locked shut.  Corky 
               moves around the desk, dropping down behind it.

</b>                         When I'm inside, I will get the money.

               From her earlobe, she chooses the right pick, sliding out 
               the silver tool.

               It takes only a second and the first lock pops open.

               She is working on the other lock when the door is pushed 
               open and Caesar walks in.

               Corky drops down, grasping for her gun --

               As Caesar, wearing only underwear, enters.  He blows on the 
               drying polish on his fingernails before delicately selecting 
               a suit from his closet.

               The gun ready, Corky, pressed against the desk, waits until 
               he leaves.

               She lets her breath out, then pops the second lock, unzips 
               the black duffel bag and quickly empties the case, filling 
               the bag with fat money bricks.

               Finished, she zips up the bag and looks about.

               She fills the case, then closes it.

               Corky can hear him pounding.  She looks down and smiles.

               looks at the wall, then goes to the bed and picks up the 
               phone.

               As she dials, we move along the phone cord, following it

               We move out from another jack, following a different cord.

               Corky is sitting with her back to the wall.  The black phone

</b>
               Caesar is at the bar, drinking the Scotch.  The gun in front 
               of him.  Across the room, Violet sits, staring holes through 
               him.

               They wait in silence.

</b>                         You sure you don't want a drink?

               Violet says nothing.

</b>
               In the dark, Corky sits, her face, her posture very similar 
               to Violet's.

               She is concentrating, her mind somewhere else, when the door 
               buzzer sounds.

               She turns her head and hears Caesar faintly answering the 
               intercom.

               Corky stands just as --

<b>               INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
</b>
               Violet stands.

               Caesar faces her for a moment, then shoves the gun into his 
               belt behind his back.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Corky watches through the door peep as three men pass by.

<b>               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               There is a knock and Caesar opens the door.

               GINO MARZZONE is an old Italian whose face is a mask of 
               irritated indifference.

               ROY, his enormous driver, is behind him.

               Caesar smiles, greeting them in Italian with open arms.

               Johnnie is the last inside.  He has tape over his broken 
               nose.  He smiles and hugs Caesar.

</b>                         No, no, Caesar.  Not now.

               He smiles again, patting him on the shoulder, then throwing 
               a fake punch.

               Caesar sees Gino with his bright Italian smile, flattering 
               Violet, kissing her.

               As he bends to kiss her hand, she sees Caesar watching them.

</b>                         Then neither will I.

               This makes Violet very uncomfortable.

</b>                         No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.

</b>                         Caesar, make that two TNTs.

               Caesar's hand shakes as he pours Gino's Scotch.

</b>
               Pacing in her socks, Corky tries to think through several 
               possible situations.  She stops, staring at the bag of money.

               The idea of its sitting out in the open suddenly bothers 
               her.

<b>               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Caesar hands Violet and Johnnie a drink.  He stares at her.  
               She stares back.

<b>                                     JOHNNIE
</b>                         Salud, eh.  Roy, Violet, Pop, Caesar.

               Caesar watches Johnnie, suspecting everything he does.

               Johnnie reaches into his pocket and takes out a cellular 
               phone.

                         now.  You too, Johnnie.

               Each man sits on either side of Gino.

                         understand?  Good.

               Caesar sees Johnnie smiling at him, but when Gino turns, the 
               smile disappears.

               Corky drops a hefty bag, knotted tight, into an open five-
               gallon bucket of paint.

               As she picks up a paint stick, we see a second bag beside 
               another bucket.

               She pushes the first bag down until it disappears, enveloped 
               by the milk-white liquid.

               Caesar puts the briefcase onto the coffee table.

               Gino looks up at Caesar, very serious, with his hand on the 
               case.

               He looks dead at Johnnie.

               Caesar shakes his head.

               Gino throws down the last of the Scotch.

               Gino checks his watch, shouting in Italian.  Johnnie shouts 
               back until Gino throws up his hands, refusing to listen.

               He gestures to his empty glass, then folds his arms, leaning 
               back.  Caesar gets the bottle.

               Boom!  Caesar blows a hole in the couch right between 
               Johnnie's legs.  Johnnie screams.

               He starts walking toward Caesar.  Roy moves around for a 
               good angle.

               He backs up as Gino walks straight to him.

</b>                         Give it to me.

               He reaches up and takes bold of the barrel.  Caesar looks 
               resigned as he shuts his eyes.

               Close on Gino's hand holding the gun barrel as --

               Caesar fires.

               From behind the gun we watch Gino's grip yanked free, time 
               melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his 
               eyes wide in disbelief.

               His body hits the floor and the room erupts.

               Roy dives, drawing his gun as Caesar continues to fire, 
               pumping the trigger.

               Violet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams, falling 
               towards his father.

               Blood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering 
               and sliding across the floor.

               Johnnie lunges at Caesar as Caesar turns and fires, hitting 
               Johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle 
               everything around him.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The gun continues to fire as Corky clutches the phone, 
               whispering.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         This is an emergency!

<b>               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Crunched down behind the bar, Violet listens to the only 
               sound, repeating in the unnatural quiet:

               Click.  Click.

               Click.

               Rising, she peers over the edge of the bar.

               Caesar is standing in the aftermath.  His gun is still aimed 
               at Johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over.

               The bodies are still, blood silently pooling around them.

               Blinking the sweat from his eyes, Caesar sees Violet.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         I had to do it, Violet.  You saw it.  
                         I had no choice.  It was Johnnie.  
                         That lying fuck.  He made me do it.

               He looks down at Jobnnie, hate rising like bile.

<b>                                     CAESAR

                         think?  You stupid fuck.

               Kicking the body, be causes a series of sickening wet noises.

<b>                                     CAESAR

                         Who's the dead lying rat-fuck?  Take 
                         another guess, take another fucking 
                         guess!

               He stops, panting, unable to catch his breath.  Violet is 
               afraid to even look at him.

               Blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards.

               Caesar tries to clear his head, mopping the sweat from his 
               face.  He bends down and starts searching Johnnie's pockets.

               He finds his keys.

               Lost in thought, he goes to Gino.  Throwing open the coat, 
               he sees the airplane ticket.  There is a bullet hole in it.

               He checks the times and then his watch.

                         disappears and not if the money is

               He picks up Roy's gun and stuffs it in his belt.

               In the distance, the wail of a police siren can be heard.

               Caesar flies into action.

               Grunting, he hauls Gino's body up, drags it to the bathroom 
               and throws it into the tub.  He returns for Johnnie's body.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Standing near the bathroom, Corky hears the metal echo of 
               the tub.  Looking at her tub, she imagines what he is doing.

               Through the wall, she hears the door buzzer.

               The buzzer sounds again as Violet sees him lift Roy's body.

               He heads back to the bathroom, dropping Roy onto the other 
               two.

               The three bloody bodies fill the tub.

               We see Johnnie's arm hanging over the edge as Caesar snaps 
               the shower curtain around, hiding them.

               making a bed, letting it fall to the floor and cover most of 
               the blood.

               Crouching, Caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands 
               and face.

               Violet opens the door.

               Caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink.

               Just as the cops enter the living room, Caesar stands, looking 
               comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands.

               Tbe cops look at each other again.

               Wiping his wet hand on his pants, Caesar shakes hands with

               Cop #2 enters, walking right past the shower curtain.  We

               She stares at his shoes on the rug.

               Watching everything, Caesar takes a sip of his drink.  He 
               slips his gun out and holds it at his side.

</b>
               There is a bulge in the shower curtain where we imagine 
               Johnnie's arm is hanging.

               Slowly we slide down to the bottom edge of the plastic 
               curtain, where a drip of blood forms and --

               Plips into a small red spot on the white tile floor.

               to Caesar.

               Corky hears the cop say goodbye to Violet.  The door closes.  
               She isn't sure what she should do.

               Over her shoulder, she notes the bucket of paint.  She lets 
               the cops leave.

               Caesar puts on a new shirt, the gun stuffed in his pants.

               Corky rises at the sound of Caesar's door closing.

               We track her along the wall to the foyer as she follows the 
               faint sounds of Caesar and Violet's footsteps.

<b>               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               As they pass by, Violet looks up to the door of the empty 
               apartment, straight at the peephole.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT Corky is pressed against the door, eye 
               at the peephole.

               She sees that Violet is afraid as the two women seem to speak 
               to each other with their eyes.

               Caesar is on his knees, searching under the seats of Johnnie's 
               Mercedes.  Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap.

               From the main doors, Corky slips out of the building.  Hiding 
               behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot.

               Corky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her 
               hand.

               Violet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward 
               the busy street.

               Standing, Caesar pounds on the car.

               We see Johnnie's home has been laid to waste.  The furniture 
               is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes 
               punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn 
               up.

                         no answer.

               Caesar looks at Violet.

</b>                         Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money.

               He hangs up.

</b>
               Caesar drags himself in.  Violet closes the door behind them.

               Caesar moves into the room where it happened.  He is dizzy 
               and confused and does not want to be here.

               Violet turns him around.

               She turns him toward the bathroom.  He nods.

               Violet enters and goes straight for the phone.  She looks at

               The phone rings.

               When Corky answers, Violet almost collapses with relief.

</b>
               A box of Hefty bags tucked under his arm, a coil of 
               clothesline in his hand, Caesar searches through several 
               cabinets.

</b>
               Violet glances at the door.

                         soon as he leaves, it's over.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Corky falls against the wall.

</b>                         just a little longer and it's ours.

<b>               INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
               Mumbling to himself, Caesar walks out of the kitchen, heading 
               for the bedroom.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Violet reaches out and touches the wall, as if she were 
               touching Corky.

               Corky turns to the wall.

</b>                         I know, Violet.  I know.

               Her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over, 
               where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact 
               same place.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Suddenly, Violet hears Caesar.

<b>                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
</b>                         Violet?

               As he opens the door, she slams down the phone.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               The line cuts off.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Fear and panic paralyze Violet as Caesar drops everything, 
               grabbing for his gun.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         Who was that?

               He levels the gun at her.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         Who the fuck was that?

               She stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey?  
                         Did you?!

               She shakes her head and he throws her on the bed.  The gun 
               aimed at her, he picks up the phone and --

               Hits the redial.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Unsure of what happened, Corky hears the phone ring and 
               answers it on reflex.

               Listening, she waits.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Caesar listens, waiting as long as he can.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky hangs up, jumping away from the wall.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Caesar hits the redial again.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Panicking, Corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud 
               in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Turning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing 
               in the empty apartment.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Corky rips the plug out of the wall.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               The line goes dead.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         Who is that?  Who is over there?!  
                         Tell me!

               She tries to get away, but he grabs her and slaps her to the 
               ground.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT
</b>
               Corky hears Violet scream and that does it.  Gun in hand, 
               she flies at the door.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               The door to the empty apartment slams shut and Caesar, hearing 
               it, starts to run --

               But Violet reaches out, catching his ankle, sending him 
               crashing to the dresser.

<b>                                     VIOLET

<b>               INT HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               The door to Caesar's apartment is locked.  Corky falls to 
               one knee, whipping two lock picks from her earlobe.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Caesar raises the gun to pistol-whip Violet and she screams.

<b>               INT.  HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               Working the lock, Corky hears Violet's scream cut off.

               She feels the tumblers click, and rotates the cylinder.

               A shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears 
               something that sounds like footsteps.  Corky freezes.

               Corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole.

               She can almost feel Caesar beyond the door, but grits her 
               teeth and turns the doorknob.

<b>               INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               The door cracks open and Corky slips in, gun-first.  As she 
               moves into the room, we see Caesar behind her.

               He puts his gun to her head.

<b>                                     CAESAR

               Corky hesitates.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         Drop it!

               She does.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         Turn around.

               Rising from her crouch, she turns and he recognizes her.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         You!?  Holy fucking Christ!  You 
                         gotta be kidding me!

               He starts to laugh when she strikes --

               Knocking the gun, she punches him, slamming him back against 
               the door as --

               She twists, diving, grabbing her gun, just as --

               He steps and kicks her full in the face.

<b>               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT
</b>
               Still unconscious, Corky's head jerks, reacting to the kick.  
               We see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick 
               split the skin.  She is again swimming toward consciousness.

               We hear water splash, her face flinching as we move closer, 
               the sounds and voices echoing.

<b>                                     CESAR (V.O.)

               We hear Caesar slapping her.

               Corky's face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink 
               open.

               Coming into focus is Caesar, standing over her with an empty 
               glass in one hand.

<b>                                     CAESAR

               Except for the gag, she is bound as we have seen her bound 
               in the closet.

               Caesar yanks out his gun and puts it to her head.

<b>                                     CAESAR

                         bullshit, you understand?

               She sees Violet on the bed, also bound hand and foot.

                         sick.

               The gun digs into her cheek.

               He fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the 
               wall behind her.

               His point made, he puts the gun back to Corky's head.

               He rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair.

               He stomps around the room.

               He storms out of the room.

               Corky looks up at Violet.

               She pulls at the ropes as Violet slides off the bed.

               Caesar throws open the broom closet and grabs the clippers 
               that Mickey used to cut off Shelly's finger.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The two women are back-to-back, fingers working at each 
               other's knots when Caesar bursts into the room.

</b>                         Oh, no no no.

               Grabbing Corky by the boots, he drags her and flips her so 
               that she can now see Violet.

               He drops down onto Violet putting the clippers in front of 
               her face.

</b>                         Hey, Violet, you remember these?

               Her eyes widen with terror.  She starts to scream when he 
               stuffs a towel in her mouth.

               Laying against Violet, he turns to Corky.

<b>                                     CAESAR

                         get a good idea what's coming.

               He takes hold of Violet's pinky finger, stretching it out.

                         answer, I'm going to cut off one 
                         finger.

                         with you.

               He puts the finger between the blades.

</b>                         Where is the money?

               Corky sees Violet thrashing helplessly.  She has no choice.  
               Her mouth opens as --

               The door buzzer rings.

               Caesar is distracted, trying to think who it could be.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         ...  Mickey.

               He sees the phone, where he dropped it, lying off the hook.

               The door buzzer rings again, more insistently.  Corky sees 
               him momentarily unnerved.

               He looks back at her.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         I said where --

               He starts to cut and Corky screams --

</b>                         No!  I'll tell you!

               He stops, the door buzzing continuously.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         It's over there in the empty 
                         apartment.

               As she speaks, the sound of the door buzzer changes.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         I put it inside one of the paint 
                         drums.

               He is not looking at her; listening, he realizes that Mickey 
               is buzzing the other apartments.

               CAESAR stands as the buzzing stops.  He pulls out his gun 
               and aims it at Corky.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         I promised I would kill you.

               He cocks it.

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         You can't kill me yet.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         Why?

<b>                                     CORKY
</b>                         I could be lying.

               His hand start to shake with ftustration.  He is beginning 
               to hate this woman more than he ever hated Johnnie.

               Taking a deep breath, he eases back the hammer.

<b>                                     CAESAR

                         done that.

               He kicks her again, snapping her head back.

               After he leaves, Violet looks over and sees Corky lying 
               unconscious.

<b>               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Caesar tries to open the door to the empty apartment but it 
               is locked.

</b>                         Fuck.

               At the end of the hall, the elevator "dings." Just as the 
               door opens, Caesar jumps back into his apartment.

               His mind a racing blur, he locks the door and runs back to 
               the bedroom.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               With another towel, he gags Corky and drags her into the 
               closet.  In her pocket, he finds the key.

               He closes the doors, then hangs up the phone.

               Grunting, he hauls Violet up over his shoulder --

               When there is a knock on the door.

<b>               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Carrying Violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws 
               Corky's gun into the freezer.  Mickey is banging on the door 
               as Caesar heads for the bathroom.

<b>               INT.  BATHROOM

               Dropping Violet onto the floor, he reaches behind the curtain 
               and turns on the shower.

</b>                         Mickey will get in.  I know he will.

               We hear the water hitting the bodies while Caesar starts 
               tearing off his clothes.

               She stares hard at him and his gun, then nods.

               Violet's hands are untied.  She pulls off the gag and the 
               ropes at her feet.

               Naked, Caesar sticks his head under the shower spray, wetting 
               everything.

<b>               INT.  LIVING ROOM

               Still dripping, Caesar walks into the room, a towel wrapped 
               around his waist, another towel in his hand.

               Mickey and Lou are standing in the middle of the room.

               He sees they both are holding their guns.

               Behind the bar, he sets down the towel be was holding and we

               Talking to Lou, be picks up the case and walks back, somehwo

               He pulls out a lock-pick and starts working the lock.  The

               gun.

               He is slipping toward that same desperate choice.  He is 
               going to attack when --

               Across the room, the phone rings.

               He drops the towel, raising the gun.

               Corky is wide awake, thrashing-mad, biting her gag, struggling 
               to get free.

<b>               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Caesar pulls his pants on.

</b>                         Time to find out if the dyke was 
                         stupid enough to lie.

               Caesar drags Violet througb the front door.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               The closet doors burst open as Corky fights her way out.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               Caesar sees the buckets of paint.

               He rips the lid from the nearest and kicks it over.  Paint 
               spills out across the floor.

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Suddenly Corky stops; something has caught her eye.  We drop 
               down, focusing on what she is staring at --

               The clippers.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               He kicks over the second bucket and the bag tumbles out with 
               the rushing flow of paint.

               He turns to Violet, who is already running out the door.

               Violet turns down the hall, bare feet beating against the 
               floor.

               Caesar slices out of the room behind her.

               He aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency 
               door.

               She flies, hands on the rail, spiraling down each flight as

<b>               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Straining, Corky's fingers curl around the handle of the 
               clippers.

<b>               INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
               Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to 
               the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators.

               She pounds the button and waits.

               She hears Caesar coming just as the elevator opens.

               Caesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the 
               exit.  When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of 
               the elevator --

               And catches a glimpse of her as the doors close.

<b>                                     CAESAR
</b>                         Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch.

               Taking a really deep breath, he throws open the door to the 
               stairs.

<b>               INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
               Violet takes Johnnie's cellular phone from the robe pocket 
               and dials a number.

               Mickey answers on the car phone.

                         coming - Oh God!

               She hangs up, eyes blazing.

<b>               INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
               Sweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs.

<b>               INT.  HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               The elevator opens, Violet bolts out.  She runs down the 
               hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door.

               She rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut 
               rope.

               She looks at the wall separating the apartment.

<b>               INT.  HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               Caesar half-falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat.

<b>               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT
</b>
               Gun ready, Caesar throws open the door.

               Spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but --

               The money is gone.

               Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the 
               drip trail of the plastic bag.

               The tracks lead to the bathroom.

               Caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of 
               money next to Corky's empty boots.

               Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive 
               pipe wrench.

               At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground 
               as --

               The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch.

               Before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down 
               on his arm.

               He screams as the gun hits the floor.

               She kicks it, sending it skidding, hydroplaning across the 
               paint pool to the other side, leaving a jet trail of white 
               swirls and spirals on the wood floor.

               They fight, Corky raining blows onto his back and flailing 
               arm until --

               He catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up.

               Scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun 
               when --

               Violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer.

               Caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun 
               still out of reach.

<b>                                     VIOLET

                         He's on his way.

               Violet stands for long time, the gun trained carefully on 
               him as he rises from the floor.

               Panting, Caesar watches her like a mad dog.

               She glances down and sees the paint-covered gun.

                         I know why, because you don't want 
                         to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you?  
                         No, I know you don't.

               Violet fires --

               The bullet hits Caesar in the shoulder, knocking him off 
               balance.  Another doubles him over as blood speckles the 
               pool of paint.

               She empties the gun into him.  His body arcs back, falling, 
               splashing into the paint.

               Caesar's blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening 
               white.
