<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING
</b>
          CLOSE ON: A "Have A Nice Day" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises
          past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING.
          We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE
          worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his
          physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome
          too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face.
          Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian
          tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup .

<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
          The apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific
          New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He
          sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits
          the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news:

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN
</b>          --addressing the United Nations today,
          the President expressed his concern over
          the increasingly intense territorial
          disputes in both Asia and the Middle
          East.
          CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--

<b>          PRESIDENT
</b>          The sound of a bullet at one end of the
          world echoes across the ocean to the
          other end. Armed conflict is not self
          contained in its respective region--the
          consequences reverberate through every
          nation across the world and therefore
          must be avoided at all costs.
          CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman--

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN
</b>          While the President's position was clear,
          he did not comment on whether or not he
          would order Dr. Manhattan into action
          should the situation continue to
          escalate.
          CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he
          appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage
          shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads
          straight for him.

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in
          its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face.
          With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr.
          Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the
          smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed--
          --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel--
          CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake
          jumps up, immediately at the ready--
          --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake
          sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see
          that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT
          HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake.

<b>          BLAKE
</b>          Just a matter of time, I suppose.
          With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from
          under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The
          Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes,
          but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER
          from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro
          . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot
          off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out
          of Blake's hand--
          --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder
          drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like
          the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much
          faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to
          the head.
          Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake
          up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great
          New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in
          the eye
          . and starts laughing. Hysterical.

<b>          BLAKE (CONT'D)
</b>          I always thought I knew the punchline.
          But I guess the joke's on me now.
          He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment--
          --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS
          HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a
          sound as he plummets to the sidewalk.

<b>          EXT. STREET - EVENING
</b>
          CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in
          fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his
          head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the
          sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood
          DRIPS on it
          . when the pin is WASHED AWAY.

<b>          EXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT)
</b>
          A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from
          the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its
          place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper.

<b>          COP 1
</b>          Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!

<b>          SHOPKEEPER
</b>          It's been over four hours, I got a
          business to run--
          As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as
          the water carries it to a DRAIN--
          --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV
          as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it.
          We never see his face. We move from his POV--
          --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at
          the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still
          arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow
          tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG.
          Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse
          the magazines and periodicals, most of which have
          inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere
          currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads "War?", The
          New York Times: "China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese
          Waters," The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President
          with Dr. Manhattan: "What Me Worry?"
          The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers.

          We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment
          building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass
          window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--

<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          --inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded)
          and DET. FINE (street worn, but not quite cynical yet) walk
          through the crime scene. Fine studies the broken window.

<b>          DET. FINE
</b>          Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225.
          A solid 225, guy was built like a
          linebacker. This is plate glass too,
          you'd have to step on the gas just to put
          a crack in this. Had to be a two man job.
          At least. You check the bedroom?

<b>          DET. GALLAGHER
</b>          Drawers were open, tossed through.

</b>          Or made to look like one.
          (tosses Fine an ID)
          Found that in the bedroom.
          Det. Fine studies it. It's Blake's UNITED NATIONS ID. It

          than the both of us.
          He leaves Det. Fine to ponder this.

<b>          EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
</b>
          Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news
          stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone.
          We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the
          broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC

<b>          SHEETING.
</b>
<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
</b>          Rorschach's Journal, October 12th.
          Earlier today I came across what appeared
          to be a suicide. It was later learned to
          be a homicide. Someone's time was up.
          Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his
          pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the
          person whose POV we were in earlier.

<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          I discovered a clue. Something I
          recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly
          . I heard my own clock ticking.
          We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time--
          RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench
          coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS
          moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a
          Rorschach test. Scary looking.
          Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and
          FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches
          itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT,
          Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.

<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          With a grunt, Rorschach pulls himself past the plastic
          sheeting, through the window, and into Blake's apartment. He
          investigates, silent. He sees the same things that the cops
          saw . . but he notices the speakers by the TV. Notices one
          of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew.
          Rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the
          speaker was hollow. (The Intruder clearly took Blake's gun
          and put the cover back on when he left. Why?)

<b>          INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT
</b>
          Blake's clothing hangs in military rows. Rorschach runs his
          fingers along the wall-seams. He pauses, presses on the
          hanger BAR, which SLIDES BACK to reveal a RED BUTTON.
          Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN,
          revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRAMED
          PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included in
          this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook--he
          was a superhero.
          WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS,
          GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got it.
          But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention.
          Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current
          COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over it
          all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK.
          Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE
          BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads "The Comedian Gets Last
          Laugh On Moloch." Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed in
          the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhero
          called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervillian
          named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.)
          On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of
          superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhattan,
          as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, and
          LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The
          caption below reads: "The New Watchmen."
          Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly
          closes the secret hatch.

          than be posted at a crime scene all

          Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than
          being concerned. He then enters the bedroom.
          Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:

<b>          COP 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Clear! I'm checking the other rooms.
          Cop 2 relaxes a bit, turns--
          --and comes face to "face" with Rorschach, standing inches
          away. The Cop's face goes slack with childish terror. He goes
          to yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, "Shhh"--
          The fingers JAB INTO THE COP'S WINDPIPE. The cop HISSES and
          falls silently as Rorschach brushes past him like a whisper.

          CLOSE ON: A FRAMED PHOTO of the first Watchmen--identical to
          the old one in Blake's closet. Holding the photo is HOLLIS
          MASON. He puts the photo down, but we don't see his face yet.

          Then the media got wind, ran with it,

          the past few years--his edges have gone soft. He was in the

          Before Dan can answer he notices a breaking news report on
          the TV:

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN
</b>          This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach
          has assaulted a New York City police
          officer who was guarding a crime scene in
          the early morning hours. Rorschach is on
          the FBIs ten most wanted list for
          violation of the Keene Act, which banned
          masked heroes ten years ago.
          Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on
          screen.

<b>          HOLLIS
</b>          Well, forced all of you guys out except
          one.

<b>          (BEAT)

          Dan nods, then leaves.

<b>          EXT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
</b>
          Dan descends the stairs. He pulls up his collar against the
          cold and walks down an alley. A SIGN below Hollis' apartment
          reads: "MASON AUTO REPAIRS--Obsolete models a specialty!"

</b>
          Dan rides the subway, lost in thought, when a group of GANG
          MEMBERS, wearing yellow and black BANDANAS brush past him.
          ONE stops. Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far.

<b>          GANG LEADER
</b>          Move your leg.

<b>          DAN
</b>          What?

<b>          GANG LEADER
</b>          I said move, dick.
          Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his
          eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The
          Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass.

<b>          EXT. DAN DREIBERG'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
</b>
          Dan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for
          his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert.
          His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED.
          There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house.

<b>          INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Dan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen. He
          hears odd, metal scraping SOUNDS.

<b>          INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Dan enters the kitchen, stunned to find--

<b>          DAN
</b>          Rorschach.
          Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN

<b>          OF BEANS.
</b>
<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some
          beans. You don't mind?

<b>          DAN
</b>          No, of course not. You uh, want me to
          heat some up for you?

</b>          Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask
          back down. There's a strong familiarity between the two but
          at the same time, Dan is wary.

<b>          DAN
</b>          You were on the news. They say you
          attacked a cop.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Other than that . How have you been
          keeping?

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Out of prison. So far. Look at this.
          He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it
          up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH.

<b>          DAN
</b>          This little stain, is that bean juice or--

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Human bean juice. It belonged to the
          Comedian. He's dead.

<b>          DAN
</b>          The Comedian?
          Nervous now, Dan glances out the window.
          DAN (cont'd)
          Let's talk downstairs.

<b>          INT. DAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
</b>
          Rorschach follows Dan to a CLOSET, at the end of the hall.
          Dan opens the closet, revealing an old BOOKSHELF. With some
          difficulty, Dan PULLS OPEN the HINGED BOOKSHELF with a RUSTY
          CREAK. STEEL STAIRS lead down into the dark.

<b>          INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
          The two men descend into Dan's WORKSHOP--the dusty remnants
          of a hero's LAB; Old computers and an OWL-COSTUME, hanging in
          a locker. No-one has been down here for years. In the center
          of the space, an OVAL VEHICLE the size of a subway car is
          covered by a dusty TARP--the Owl-Ship.

</b>          Murder. Someone threw him out a window.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might
          not have known who Blake was.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian?
          Ridiculous.

<b>          DAN
</b>          You're right. I heard he was working for
          the government. Maybe it was a political
          killing.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Maybe. Or maybe someone's decided to kill
          off costumed heroes.

<b>          DAN
</b>          You don't think that's . a little
          paranoid?

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Is that what they're saying about me now?
          That I'm paranoid?

<b>          DAN
</b>          I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot
          of enemies over the years, even amongst
          his friends, if he had any. The man
          wasn't exactly endearing. Just because
          something happened to him doesn't mean it
          involves us.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          One of our own has been murdered. I
          thought you might be interested. An
          attack on one is an attack on all of us,
          right?
          Dan hesitates.

<b>          DAN
</b>          I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've
          all been out. Except you. You know that.

          Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          I remember. Used to come here a lot.
          Back when we were partners.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach.

          What ever happened to them?

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          You quit.
          Rorschach disappears into the SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to
          reminisce alone. Dan glances at his old costume hanging.

<b>          INT. SLEAZY MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
          The kind of room you rent by the hour. Or the minute even. A
          cheap looking HOOKER enters with an ARMY OFFICER, giggling.
          She playfully pushes the Officer onto the bed.

<b>          HOOKER
</b>          So tell me what you wanna do. Sir.

<b>          ARMY OFFICER
</b>          Seeing that I don't have to be back to
          base till Friday--everything.
          He puts a stack of BILLS on the dresser. Then takes his
          UNIFORM off like he can't wait. The Hooker gets on top of him-
          --when the DOOR FLIES OFF THE HINGES. Rorschach steps in,
          yanks the Hooker off--
          --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which
          Rorschach dodges. Rorschach GRABS the guy's arm, then KICKS
          the Officer on the side of his KNEE, tearing the joint to
          shreds. The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor--
          Rorschach nails him in the head with a BLACK JACK, knocking
          him out.
          The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by the hair and SLAMS
          her face into the wall.

<b>          EXT. VEIDT ENTERPRISES - MORNING

          A mammoth, shining skyscraper. At the 50th-floor there is a
          HUGE V-SHAPED HOLE where WATER FALLS.

<b>          INT. VEIDT ENTERPRISES - LOBBY - MORNING

          A mammoth lobby. The decor is Egyptian and marble. Dan
          approaches a beautiful ASSISTANT behind an imposing desk.

<b>          DAN
</b>          I'm here to see Adrian Veidt.

<b>          ASSISTANT
</b>          Do you have an appointment?

<b>          DAN
</b>          No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is

<b>          ASSISTANT
</b>          I'm sorry, Mr. Veidt doesn't see anyone
          without an appointment.

<b>          DAN
</b>          I understand, but if you would just tell
          Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, I'm an
          old friend.

          Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken.
          She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office.
          Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by
          nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him--
          it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS
          eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns.

          Dan enters the enormous office--there are three TV feeds
          PROJECTED onto the walls, architectural models of real estate
          developments, poster size ad campaigns for "Nostalgia"
          perfume--all reflecting the financial empire of Veidt
          Enterprises owned by--
          --ADRIAN VEIDT, late 30s, movie star looks, is at the far end
          of the office, SPRINTING on a treadmill as journalist DOUG
          ROTH holds a tape recorder to him. Adrian sees Dan
          approaching, smiles wide. He holds up a finger, telling Dan
          to hold on a sec. Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch. Picks
          up a Fortune magazine with Adrian on the cover.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you
          are considered the world's smartest man?

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>
<b>          (LAUGHS)
</b>          I think it's better to be the world's
          most modest man. You should ignore my PR
          people, they tend to be a little too
          enthusiastic.
          Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly
          seems out of breath as he answers questions.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          If we could move off the subject of
          business for a moment, I'm curious
          whether the world's smartest man thinks
          we're headed for our next World War.
          Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Predicting stock prices isn't the same as
          predicting world events. I hope there
          isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that
          matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has
          some exciting plans, plans that will,
          pardon the cliche, truly make this world
          a better place. My team of engineers and
          scientists have been working with Dr.
          Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new,
          cheap form of energy which will eliminate
          the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with
          no toxic emissions. This energy could

          Dan and Adrian sit, talking over coffee. Dan examines an
          ACTION-FIGURE of Adrian as OZYMANDIAS (his superhero alias).

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Rorschach. He paid me a visit too.

<b>          DAN

          Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors.
          Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian

          Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his
          girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime,
          enters from the other end.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What
          are you doing here? You're a wanted man.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Don't call me that. My mother made me

          been murdered.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Yes, since he and I are the only two
          extranormal operatives currently employed
          by the government, I was informed. The
          CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic
          groups.
          Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He
          speaks in a cold, even, matter of fact manner.

</b>          I have my own theories. But neither of

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          A live human body and a dead human body
          have the same number of particles.
          Structurally there's no difference.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Well, I might not be able to count
          molecules, but either way, Blake was a
          bastard. You know he tried to rape my
          mother?

          Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's
          smitten with her and that he probably has been for years.

<b>          BLAKE (O.S.)
</b>          Fireworks.
          A young Blake sits in a derelict Saigon bar, mean drunk. His
          face is devoid of his trademark scar.

<b>          BLAKE (CONT'D)
</b>          You'd think this country'd had enough
          goddamn fireworks. If we'd've lost this
          war, I think it might have driven us
          crazy, y'know? As a country. But we
          didn't. Thanks to you.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          You sound bitter.

          They both turn. A pretty VIETNAMESE GIRL stands in the door.
          She's pregnant, just starting to show.

<b>          BLAKE
</b>          Fantastic. Just what I need.

</b>          No. You will remember. You will remember
          me and my country forever.
          She SMASHES a bottle. Blake turns just as the broken SHARDS
          SLASH HIS FACE, slicing him his jagged scar

          She drops, dead.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Blake. She was pregnant. You gunned her
          down.
          Blake turns on him, spitting fury.

<b>          BLAKE
</b>          That's right! And you know what? You
          watched me! You could've changed the gun
          into steam or the bullets into mercury or
          the bottle into snowflakes, but you
          didn't, did you? You're drifting outta
          touch, Doc--I've seen it. Don't tell me
          the war got to you.

<b>          BLAKE (V.0.)
</b>          This is all bullshit.
          Dan, fit and trim in full Nite Owl regalia, attends the
          meeting of the "new" Watchmen. Rorschach is there, as is a
          teenage Laurie, dressed in her tight spandex costume. Dr.
          Manhattan, his age unchanged, stands with his girlfriend
          JANEY SLATER, though he casts occasional glances at young
          Laurie . who definitely glances back. Dan also pays
          Laurie attention, but she is oblivious.
          A younger Adrian, dressed as Oxymandias, leads the meeting.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          What are you saying, Comedian?
          Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table,
          a FLASK in hand. The PAPER in his hand reads: "Arab Leaders
          Call Dr. Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan."'

<b>          BLAKE
</b>          What I'm saying is this whole bringing
          back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It
          didn't work twenty years ago, and it
          ain't gonna work just because you want to
          keep on playing Cowboys and Indians.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Maybe we should agree on no drinking at
          meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made
          real headway on the gang problem by
          pooling our efforts.
          Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          That's true. But something like this
          seems too big. Too bureaucratic.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Bureaucracies can be effective with the
          right leadership--

<b>          BLAKE
</b>          And that would be you, right Veidt? I
          mean you're the "smartest guy in the
          world," right?

</b>          Justice. Hilarious. There's no such thing
          as justice.
          He stands, moving to Adrian's DISPLAY which outlines the
          Watchmen's agenda: GANGS, RACKETEERING, DRUGS. Blake flicks
          his ZIPPO and the display GOES UP IN FLAMES.

<b>          BLAKE
</b>          Justice doesn't matter, alright? Because
          twenty years from now we're all gonna be
          dust. Mankind's been trying to kill each
          other off since the beginning of time and
          now we finally got the power to finish
          the job. Ain't nothin' gonna matter when
          the nukes start flying, and I promise you
          they will. Then Ozymandias here is gonna
          be the smartest man on the cinder.
          He sneers and walks out. Silence. Uncomfortable in the wake
          of truth, the others pack up to go, muttering apologies to
          Adrian, but Adrian ignores them, staring at the flames
          flickering across his face. He seems more thoughtful than

          The Lone Man removes his hat and coat. He is old, withered.
          He is EDGAR JACOBI. In his younger days, he was a

          clipping in Blake's closet.

          Over Moloch's shoulder Rorschach's hat-brim TILTS UP. As
          Moloch turns, Rorschach lunges, PINS Moloch's ARM behind his
          back and SLAMS him to the floor.

          Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers,
          looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through
          it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from
          "Pyramid Industries."

<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)

</b>          "But doctor," he says.
          ULTRA-SLOW, Blake crashes through his apartment window.

          Blake FLIES TOWARD FRAME on his silent trip to the ground.

          CLOSE ON: Laurie, eyes closed with pleasure, as Dr.

</b>          Hey, your finger, it's like licking a
          battery. It's all--
          She opens her eyes. They widen in shock and horror as she

<b>          LAURIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh God! That's horrible! Stop it!
          Laurie jumps up. The two Dr. Manhattans stand, confused.

</b>          Forget about it. I overreacted. It was
          just strange to see--
          Laurie can now see into the KITCHEN, where yet a THIRD DR.
          MANHATTAN is working on an experiment. Her eyes blaze.

          Laurie WHIPS a full BEAKER at 3's chest. It PASSES THROUGH

          IN THE HALL: Laurie nearly bumps into Dr. Manhattan 2.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN 2
</b>          --but logically, not clouded with human
          emotion.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN 2
</b>          Laurie, where are you--
          The door slams. Laurie's left. For good.
          Dr. Manhattan 2 stands there. He walks back to the BEDROOM
          where 1 is. Dr. Manhattan 1 holds an OLD PHOTO. In the photo
          is a COUPLE, smiling into the camera. We recognize the woman
          as Janey Slater, Dr. Manhattan's ex-girlfriend, who we saw in
          Adrian's flashback at Blake's funeral. We recognize the man
          in the photo as . Dr. Manhattan. When he was human.

          You're more than welcome to join. In

          They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless
          Man is arguing with the News Vendor:

          The Thug draws a PISTOL on her. Dan, still on the ground,

          up off the ground.

          journalist who interviewed Adrian earlier, stands.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          Dr. Manhattan, Doug Roth, Nova Times. Do
          you remember a man named Wally Weaver?

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Yes, he was a good friend of mine. When
          we were both physicists.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          He died of cancer.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          I remember. I attended his funeral.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          How about Edgar Jacobi, also known as the
          supervillian Moloch? You had a lot of
          battles with him, didn't you? Did you
          know that he has cancer as-well?
          The News Host looks confused. Adrian turns to the Press
          Agent, growing concerned with where this is leading.
          CUT TO: Dan, snapping the GUNMAN'S wrist back and up--
          Barrel aimed at the Thug's CHIN. In the last fraction of a
          second, Dan SHIFTS the gun two inches left as it FIRES,
          deafening the Thug, but leaving him alive. BACK TO:

          would-be assassin. The place is decent but messy.
          Rorschach spots a PORNO MAG on the coffee table. On the couch
          nearby, a pair of PANTS. Rorschach picks them up, reaches
          into the pockets. He pulls out some cash, credit cards--
          --and an ID for Pyramid Industries. It says Chess was a
          security guard
          . and then Rorschach remembers the pension check he saw
          at Moloch's house. From Pyramid Industries.
          Rorschach sees a LAPTOP over on the kitchen table. The
          computer is on and shows the SERVER for Pyramid Industries.
          Rorschach navigates the server until he finds the EMPLOYEE

<b>          DIRECTORY.
</b>          Once in the directory he pauses for a second. Then he types
          in a name: "Jane Slater."
          A photo of Janey Slater pops up--"Status: RETIRED."
          Rorschach stares at the screen, excited at the connection.

          key.
          Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and
          finds an ENVELOPE. He opens it and finds a NOTE that reads:
          "Tonight 11:30, M."

</b>          Somebody tried to shoot the world's
          smartest man today, Moloch.
          Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An
          ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE.

<b>          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)

          So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr.

          Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes.
          A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead.
          Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's
          the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one
          that reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU."

          last night and charged with the murder of

</b>          Rorschach is an American patriot and we
          are proud that he reads this publication.

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN
</b>          During his capture, Kovacs assaulted and
          severely injured at least nine police
          officers, shooting one officer with a
          grappling gun. That officer is in serious
          but stable condition.

<b>          ANCHORMAN
</b>          Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues
          to intensify. Both India and Pakistan
          alluded that the use of nuclear weapons
          is not out of the question--
          Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting to hear the war talk.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains
          away.

<b>          DAN
</b>          He wasn't always like that. We were a
          great team--tactically, he was brilliant.
          But I don't know, something about this
          murder charge I just can't see
          Rorschach shooting Moloch.

          Laurie laughs.

<b>          INT. PRISON HALLS - DAY
</b>
          Rorschach walks, led by TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. From the
          cells, PRISONERS shout insults, death threats. Rorschach
          stares ahead. Silent. Calm.

<b>          INT. PRISON PSYCH ROOM - DAY
</b>
          The PRISON PSYCHIATRIST, Black, amiable, a mite portly, sits
          across the table from Rorschach sans mask: Cold and
          frightening. The Psychiatrist reads his FILE.

<b>          PSYCHIATRIST
</b>          Walter Kovacs. Is that your name?
          Walter?

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          No.
          The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully.

<b>          PSYCHIATRIST
</b>          Let me explain your situation here,
          Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may
          be able to convince them that you should
          to be treated medically, in a hospital,
          which I believe is best for you. But the

</b>          How about this one? What do you see here?
          FLASH OF: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his MOTHER,
          HALF NAKED, EMBRACE A MAN AS HE HANDS HER SOME MONEY. When
          she catches Rorschach interrupting, she SMACKS him in the
          face. Shuts the door on him.

          The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card.
          FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER
          BOYS, teasing him. Calling him "son of a whore." Rorschach
          just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his
          face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy
          like a wild animal--biting, clawing .

          The Psychiatrist sighs, puts the cards down.

          about Rorschach

<b>          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
</b>
           Rorschach, walks through intermittent STREETLIGHTS. In his
           GLOVE, he holds a PHOTO of an angelic SIX YEAR OLD GIRL.

<b>           RORSCHACH (V.0.)
</b>           I was investigating a kidnap case. Blair
          Roche, 6 year old girl. I was young then.
          Too soft on criminals. I let them live.

<b>          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
</b>
          A creepy, deserted-looking house. Rorschach peers through a
          slatted fence at TWO GERMAN SHEPHERDS FIGHTING.

<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
</b>          Broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to
          the missing girl's location.

<b>          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
</b>
          CRACK! The front door is KICKED OPEN, smashing the lock.
          Rorschach moves between a line of headless MANNEQUINS. In one
          corner rests an old WOOD-BURNING STOVE. Rorschach peers
          inside, removes a BLACKENED scrap of UNDERWEAR. It's
          decorated with little hearts and bears.

<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
</b>          I knew the girl was here. But when I
          searched the place I found nothing.

<b>          INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
</b>
          Rorschach enters the kitchen. Out the window, the DOGS are
          fighting. Rorschach opens a cupboard, where a line of KNIVES,
          CLEAVERS and a HACKSAW hang on hooks. Outside, the snarling
          dogs get LOUDER.
          Slowly now, Rorschach's gaze moves from the knives . to
          the counter. He runs his gloved finger along RED STAINED,
          DEEP-CUT GROOVES in a THICK WOODEN CHOPPING BLOCK. Blood. His
          gaze continues out the window

<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
</b>          And then I found her.

          Rorschach clenches his hands in fury, his fists tremble
          and suddenly, he relaxes. Calms.
          Rorschach slowly turns to the cupboard. He reaches for a
          large CLEAVER .

<b>          EXT. HOUSE - LATER (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
</b>
          The CHILD MOLESTER, greasy and fat, walks past the now-silent
          fence.

<b>           RORSCHACH (V.0.)
</b>           It was dark when the murderer got back.
           As dark as it gets.

<b>          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
</b>
           The Man flicks a LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. He draws a GUN.

<b>           INT. HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
</b>
          He tries the light in here. Nothing again. He turns away as
          the BODY of a DEAD GERMAN SHEPARD CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW!
          He SCRAMBLES through the warehouse, falling over mannequins.
          He FIRES madly into the dark. The SECOND DOG SMASHES INTO HIM
          FROM A SECOND WINDOW. His gun goes flying. He scrambles
          backward against the stove.
          FROM BEHIND, Rorschach CUFFS THE MAN'S WRIST TO THE STOVE.
          When the Child Molester sees that "face," he loses his
          bladder. Rorschach just stares, mask-blots shifting

<b>          CHILD MOLESTER
</b>          You think I had something to do with that
          girl? I didn't! Where's your evidence?
          Rorschach calmly points to body of the dog. (It is the
          same image Rorschach saw in the first blot-card.)

<b>          CHILD MOLESTER (CONT'D)

          The Psychiatrist listens, paralyzed. Horrified.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          A tremor of impact shook my arm. Warm
          blood splashed my face. It was Walter
          Kovacs who screamed, who closed his eyes--
          it was Rorschach who opened them again.
          The silence reels out
          RORSCHACH (cont'd)
          You see, Doctor. God didn't kill that
          little girl, fate didn't butcher her and
          destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If
          God saw what any of us did that night, he
          didn't seem to mind. From then on, I
          knew. God doesn't make the world this
          way. We do.
          The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.

          The Mess hall is PACKED, hundreds of INMATES eat dinner.
          Rorschach enters. The place goes instantly, heavily SILENT.
          Suddenly someone yells:

<b>          RANDOM VOICE
</b>          Hey Rorschach, I heard your momma was a
          whore!
          A cruel RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER and the mass conversation begins
          again as Rorschach takes his place in the food line. A HUGE
          PRISONER moves in behind him. He whispers:

<b>          PRISONER
</b>          Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous,
          right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too.

          BASKET from its mount--

          GRIPPING the man's wrist and FLINGING the BOILING GREASE INTO
          THE MAN'S FACE. The man SHRIEKS like a FIRE WHISTLE and
          CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on Rorschach.
          Rorschach is calm as he's dragged away. As the injured man's
          screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once
          again goes silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes
          of the room, marking each one. And in the silence he speaks,
          his icy voice carrying easily.

<b>          RORSCHACH

          corridor. Rorschach continues staring, straight ahead.

<b>          INT. DAN'S NIGHTMARE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON: Dan, naked, on his knees in the center of an
          INFINITE FIELD OF BLACKNESS. No corners, no exits. In the
          DISTANCE, he sees a FEMALE FORM. Desperate, he runs to her.
          It's Laurie, waiting for him IN COSTUME. They kiss. She tears
          at him passionately. His SKIN suddenly TEARS AWAY like
          wrapping paper. Beneath the false skin, Dan wears his NITE-
          OWL COSTUME. Confident, he touches her face. She smiles with
          palpable heat. They kiss.
          In the background, a NUCLEAR BLAST ERUPTS. Still kissing, the

          The DOOR opens. Laurie stands in the SHAFT OF LIGHT.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Dan? Is everything okay? I heard you
          coming down the stairs
          Descending the stairs, she finds Dan before his costume,
          naked. He fiddles with an OWL-WING THROWING WEAPON.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Mask killers. War. Nuclear annihilation.
          I feel so powerless, so I've been
          afraid of this damn costume. Afraid of
          how much I need it.
          He FLINGS the owl wing crescent, whizzing into the dark.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          So. Let's take the ship out.

<b>          DAN
</b>          What?

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Who's to know? I used to be a "masked
          avenger" too, remember? I'm used to
          getting up at three in the morning to do
          something stupid. Besides, I'm already a
          wanted lady, you're already in trouble
          for hiding me, how much more trouble can
          we be in? Just give me a second--can't go

          PAN UP: DAN'S COSTUMED BODY. The Nite Owl suit is fantastic,
          intricate, but above the belly . it just barely fits, Dan
          managing to CLICK it closed.

</b>
          Laurie holds on as the Owl-Ship's ENGINES ROAR to life. The
          ship RISES INTO THE AIR and slips easily into the TUNNEL.
          Laurie watches the LIGHTS of the tunnel whiz by. At the end,
          two big STEEL DOORS open, allowing a passage UP.

          THICK FOG POURS FROM LOWER-DECK JETS as the ship RISES into

          Heading straight for the building, Dan JIGS at the last
          moment, flying the ship THROUGH THE V-SHAPED WATERFALL in the
          skyscraper's center. The water washes clean the years of
          dust. The Owl-Ship emerges, sparkling like new.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Look!
          Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED IN FLAME. Dan's jaw
          sets. He wheels the ship around and down. As they zoom
          closer, they can see people SCREAMING from the windows.

          The ship EXTENDS AN ESCAPE RAMP with Laurie on board. The

          in the spectacle of this sexy lady on this Owl-Ship.

          The Owl-Ship RISES, leaving a grateful CROWD behind. In the

          He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He
          knows what he wants and this time he's not afraid of it
          He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they
          slide each other's masks off. Their mouths melt together.

          Soft music plays. Dan and Laurie lie in a heap of discarded

          The Prisoner Rorschach burned lies in bed, his face

<b>          INT. RORSCHACH'S PRISON CELL - NIGHT

          Down the dark corridors, a ROAR is building. ALARMS ring. Big

          gift. Something from the machine shop.
          The Fat Thug wheels an ELECTRICAL WELDER to the door.
          Rorschach sits, idly TEARING his PRISON SHIRT into STRIPS.

          Rorschach.

<b>          FAT THUG
</b>          You're dead, Rorschach! We got a prison

          Rorschach SPINS, WRAPPING A SHIRT-STRIP AROUND HIS WRISTS,

</b>          Your hands. My pleasure.
          Rorschach SNAPS Fat Thug's pinky fingers. Fat Thug SHRIEKS.
          Rorschach roughly binds the fingers around the bars.
          Dumb Thug tries to reach the welder around Fat Thug's body.

          a week is not a coincidence. I mean, that
          whole cancer thing with ion, does that
          make sense to you? You didn't contract

          The ship emits a PIERCING SHRIEK. WINDOWS SHATTER. The

          of this?

<b>          DAN
</b>          When he and I were partners, we each had
          tracking implants put under our skin so
          old Archie here could find us if either
          one of us were ever in trouble. Let's see
          if Rorschach kept his in.
          Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There's a BLIP on the screen.

          The Owl-Ship stops to a hover position. The LOWER HATCH OPENS
          and a LADDER extends
          As Laurie descends the ladder, Dan simply, joyously LEAPS
          OUT, his wings SNAP WIDE to GLIDE him through the air.

          Fires burn in the cells. Shotguns and screams echo in the
          emergency lighting. Archie's Owl-Shriek is dulled here--it's
          quiet. Tense.
          Laurie and Dan turn the corner, searching. Laurie spots the
          BODY of a DEAD GUARD. She crouches to take his PISTOL, slips
          it into her waistband.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          How do we know he's still alive?
          They come upon Rorschach's cell. Dan sees the SMOKING CORPSE

          from the bars.

          He walks off.

          Dan weaves and whips the ship into the sky, above the clouds.

          The group goes around congratulating each other, when

          Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is
          behind everything. Apparently, the Owl-
          Ship is capable of the trip to
          Antarctica, but are we? I cannot imagine
          a more dangerous opponent. Veldt is
          faster than Dreiberg and myself. He used
          to joke that he was fast enough to catch
          a bullet. I believe he could. He could
          kill us both, alone in' the snow. No one
          would know.
          Rorschach descends the ladder, goes to the door of the

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          I tried to explain. Thermodynamic
          miracles--events with odds against so
          astronomical, like oxygen turning into
          gold. I have longed to witness such a
          thing and yet I neglect that in human
          coupling, millions upon millions of cells
          compete to create life over generation
          after generation: Until finally, your
          mother loves a man--Edward Blake, the
          Comedian--a man she has every reason to
          hate. And out of that contradiction,
          against unfathomable odds, it was you,
          only you, that emerged. To distill so
          specific a form from all of that chaos;
          Your creation is like . turning air
          into gold. A miracle.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          But if my birth is a miracle you, you
          could say that about anyone.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Yes, anyone in the world. But the world
          is so crowded with miracles that they
          become commonplace and we forget. I
          forget.
          They stand there in silence. Connected for the first time in
          years.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Now. Dry your eyes.
          FROM ABOVE: We see the full CRATER--the ARGYRE PLANITIA.
          Round, with two, eye-like BOULDERS set side by side, a RIDGE
          of land curling below . like a smiley-face.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN (V.0.)(CONT'D)
</b>          And let's go home.

          The owl-Ship sails through a TOWERING CLOUD BANK. The COAST
          approaches as SNOW starts to fall.

<b>          INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - DAWN
</b>
          Dan stares ahead, stoic. Thinking about Hollis, Laurie and
          Adrian. He glances at a MONITOR, tracking heat signatures.
          There's a LARGE SIGNAL ahead.

          that's emitting that much heat out here,
          must be a pretty big facility. Adrian.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          We're not going to make it, are we?
          Rorschach says nothing . when a halting WHINE sputters
          from the engines. A HUGE CLIFF APPEARS before them.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          The engines--

<b>          DAN
</b>          They're icing up, hold on!
          Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD.

<b>          EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAWN
</b>
          The ship, tiny before the massive ice-wall, climbs slowly.
          It's going to be close. The wall is 100 yards away now, the
          top-most edge barely in view. 50 yards. 20 and then

<b>          SILENCE--
</b>
<b>          DAN
</b>          We just lost the engines--find something
          to grab on to!
          The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS
          across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT.

<b>          INT. OWL-SHIP - DAWN
</b>
          Dan opens the hatch. Shrieking WIND blows the snow in. Dan
          pulls on a white, FUR-LINED SNOW-OWL costume.

<b>          DAN
</b>          The engines are de-icing. You sure I
          can't fit you with something warmer?

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Fine like this.

<b>          EXT. OWL-SHIP - DAWN
</b>
          Rorschach pulls up his trench-collar against the bitter wind.
          Dan pulls two stand-up HOVER-SCOOTERS from an OUTSIDE HATCH.
          They exchange a look and ride the scooters off into the snow.

          Adrian, dressed in his Ozymandias costume, sits alone in the
          massive hall, opposite a wall of giant PLASMA-SCREENS which
          show various television NEWS CHANNELS showing all the IMAGES

<b>          OF WAR IN THE WORLD.
</b>          Adrian sighs and hits the remote--the screens become ONE
          IMAGE--ALEXANDER THE GREAT slicing the Gordian Knot.
          By Adrian's feet is an exotic LYNX. Its unnatural beauty
          almost hides a feral danger in its eyes. Adrian pets the
          beast.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          See this painting? Alexander the Great.
          Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he
          struck North for Gordium, where the
          world's greatest puzzle waited. A great
          knot, impossible to untie. For a young
          man determined to rule the world, it was
          a challenge he couldn't resist. So he
          sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral
          thinking, you see.
          Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS.

<b>          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          What is it, girl?
          He hits the remote--the TV screens switch to MULTIPLE VIEWS
          OF Dan and Rorschach, heading toward Karnak.

<b>          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Ah. It's all right, girl. Everything's
          all right.

<b>          EXT. ANTARCTICA - SNOWFIELDS - DAWN
</b>
          Flying on the scooter, Dan wipes frost and fog from his
          goggles. He then looks up and--
          --sees KARNAK, a GARGANTUAN GLASS PYRAMID, rising out of the
          snow, the Bio-Dome attached to it.

<b>          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN

          skating on is slippery and thinner than
          it looks. Let's hope they don't overstep

          On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the door.

          Having burnt through the control panel, Dan pushes the huge
          door open. They enter the grand palace, dwarfed by its
          Macedonian massiveness.

          sake!

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're

          --the dining hall, where Adrian eats alone, at a long table.
          Though they're only a few yards away, Adrian doesn't appear
          to see them, hidden by some PILLARS.
          Dan and Rorschach signal to each other, quiet. Adrian eats--
          --and Rorschach RUSHES him from behind--
          --Adrian moves at the last second, grabs Rorschach's arm,
          ELBOWS him in the chest, spins and BACKHAND FISTS him,

          Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan
          FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with the tray--
          --then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan's NOSE. Blood SPRAYS,
          Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Now. What can I do for you?

<b>          DAN
</b>          You know! You killed the Comedian! You
          set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid
          Industries, hired all those people, gave
          them cancer and blamed it on Jon!

</b>          Yes.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          What we always intended--to improve the
          world.
          As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a
          FORK. He tries to stab Adrian in the back, but Adrian
          effortlessly dodges the blow, GRABS Rorschach's mask, TWISTS
          it, then KNEES him in the gut. Rorschach drops to the floor.
          Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan helps Rorschach up
          and they follow.

<b>          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          I never intended to kill the Comedian--
          that was an accident. Part of his duties
          as a government operative was to keep
          track of all former masked heroes, make
          sure there was no rocking of the boat. He
          must have liked Rorschach because he
          allowed him to continue to exist. I had
          thought that the Comedian might be
          incompetent, but he disproved that
          hypothesis when he discovered what was
          really going on. here in Karnak--no easy
          task. Even my staff was unaware--I made
          sure to keep each department separate.

          still, he understood the scope of what I
          was trying to accomplish. Frankly, I
          never thought he'd actually talk. But by
          the time he visited poor Moloch, he was
          cracking badly. So I had to kill him.

          As they enter the control hall, Rorschach moves to attack
          Adrian again when he and Dan hear a growl . the Lynx
          steps in between, protecting its master.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan
          nearly a decade in the works after
          analyzing confidential psychological
          profiles which predicted his withdrawal
          from human existence. By then,
          Rorschach's mask theory, 'though
          erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I
          faked my own assassination--

<b>          DAN
</b>          Why take that risk? What if the hitman
          shot you first instead of your assistant?

<b>          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          After apprehending my own assassin, I
          shoved a cyanide capsule in his mouth,

          began the plan ten years ago, my moral
          safeguards gave me pause at the necessary
          sacrifice. See, the Comedian was correct.
          What we were doing with the Watchmen was
          pointless--the savage nature of humankind
          would inevitably lead to the end of the
          world. So in order to save the world, I

          Call off your cat. Call off your cat and
          face me!

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Don't you understand? I've ended the war--
          I've ended all wars. Because of their
          fear of ion, I've forced the world into
          everlasting peace.

<b>          DAN
</b>          By committing the biggest mass murder in
          history. You have no right to play God!

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          I wasn't playing God. Just Dr. Manhattan.
          Suddenly there's a LOUD BEEPING in the hall. The Lynx growls.
          Adrian switches the monitors to the security cameras
          which show ion and Laurie materialize in the snow.

          Laurie vomits in the snow.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Adrian, of course. Who else would have
          the resources

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Wait, this is Adrian's compound? Are you

          Jon walks toward the building, entranced. Distracted.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of

          Jon materializes in the hall. Adrian sprints like lightening,

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALLS is Adrian, waiting by a
          CONTROL PANEL. He takes one last look at his Lynx.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Forgive me, girl.
          Jon enters the corridor with the Lynx; Adrian flicks a
          SWITCH. The Lynx' FUR STANDS ON END as ENERGY CRACKLES
          BETWEEN THE METAL WALLS. The Lynx HOWLS.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Adrian? Adrian, don't--
          LIGHT BLASTS through Jon and the Lynx--both are OBLITERATED.
          Adrian peers around the corner, winded by his success.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          You know, I really wasn't sure that would

          Adrian cries out, LEAPS at her as she FIRES--

          as Laurie approaches Adrian's body

<b>          DAN

<b>          INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - MORNING

</b>
<b>          I AM DISAPPOINTED IN YOU ADRIAN. VERY
</b>
<b>          DISAPPOINTED.
</b>          Jon, now 100 FEET TALL, SMASHES THROUGH THE WALL. Adrian
          crawls desperately away, grasping for his remote on the
          floor. As Jon approaches him, Jon SHRINKS to six feet.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Restructuring myself was the first trick
          I learned! It didn't kill me before, did
          you seriously think it would kill me now?
          You are nothing but a man. And the
          world's smartest man means no more to me
          than its smartest termite!
          Out of tricks, out of traps, Adrian lifts the remote.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
</b>          What is that, Adrian? Some new, ultimate
          weapon?

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Yes. Yes, you could say that.
          Adrian goes back to his wall of screens, watching the news
          reports. We hear SOUND BITES and IMAGES: "India and Pakistan
          immediately call for truce," "China stands down," "US
          withdraws forces," "Israel agrees on cease fire."
          TEARS stand in Adrian's eyes. He raises his fists in triumph.

<b>          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          I did it. I DID IT! I've saved Earth from
          Hell. Next, I will elevate her to the

          Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          I'm afraid he's correct. Exposing Adrian
          would only doom the world to nuclear
          destruction again.

<b>          DAN
</b>          He's right. All we did was fail to stop

</b>          Never. Not even in the face of

          Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication. Seeing
          this, Dan runs after Rorschach.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Rorschach!
          Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the
          exit.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Where are you going, Rorschach?

          removes his mask, tears stand in his eyes.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If

          Rorschach stood only seconds ago, then disappears--
          --reappearing across the hall where Laurie is. She is also in
          tears, watching all the horrible footage on the TV screens.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN

          He kisses her on the cheek--

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Jon, I'd hoped to talk to you. I've made

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          What's on your mind, Dan?

<b>          DAN
</b>          Your death.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Really. You want to kill me?

<b>          DAN
</b>          Yeah. You might have created peace, but
          not at the expense of justice. You need
          to pay for what you've done.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          That doesn't sound like you, Dan. That
          sounds more like Rorschach.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Exactly.
          Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV
          screens.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Only you're not Rorschach, are you now?
          How do you expect to succeed where he
          failed?

<b>          DAN
</b>          Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't.
          Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life.
          His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is
          informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About
          justice. About life.
          But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with
          ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so
          focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final
          strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily.

<b>          LAURIE

          Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her
          attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor,

          finds one last OWL-WING. The WINGS SNAP OUT. Desperate, he

          Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt.

          Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered.
          Most of Adrian has been CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a
          fine blood spray. Adrian looks over to Dan, dying.

          He puts his arm around her shoulder.

</b>          As long as no-one ever finds out that
          Adrian was behind it all, the public will
          think ion is still up there, watching.

          be fine.

<b>          INT. THE NEW FRONTIERSMAN - DAY
</b>
          CLOSE ON: A YELLOW HAPPY FACE--suddenly SPLOTCHED with RED--
          printed on A T-SHIRT now stained with ketchup.
          WE PULL BACK: And find Seymour wears the shirt, eating a
          burger when the Editor bursts in.

<b>          EDITOR
</b>          SEYMOUR! What the hell do you got for me?

<b>          SEYMOUR
</b>
<b>          UH
</b>
<b>          EDITOR
</b>          We got nothing to write about. Everyone
          in the country, every country in the
          world is holding hands now, singing songs
          about peace and love--it's like we're
          living in a goddamn global hippie
          commune !

<b>          SEYMOUR
</b>          Um, I guess I can look for stuff in the
          crank file.

<b>          EDITOR
</b>          Crank file? Whatever! Take some
          initiative! Run whatever you like--
          Seymour turns to the PILE of submissions known as the crank
          file, where RORSCHACH'S JOURNAL sits on top. Seymour reaches--

<b>          EDITOR (CONT'D)
</b>          --I leave it entirely in your hands.
          --and picks up Rorschach's Journal . Just as he's about
          to open it, we CUT TO BLACK.
