<b>INT. BUS STATION - DAY
</b>

<b>SUPERIMPOSE:     17 YEARS AGO
</b>


Small, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER
jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16,
enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still
hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front
of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe.

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>
           Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to
           Montreal please?

<b>                           CASHIER
</b>
           Pardon?

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>
           I need a ticket to Montreal.

<b>                           CASHIER
</b>
           Montreal?

<b>                            MARTIN
</b>
           Yes, sir.     Please.

<b>                         CASHIER
</b>
           Forty-three dollars.
Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties
and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin
his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The
DRIVER loading bags.




<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a
seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him,
offers a hand. Martin shakes.

<b>                           DAN
</b>
           Dan Soulsby.

<b>                            MARTIN
</b>
           Martin.     Nice to meet you.

<b>                         DAN
</b>
           Where you heading to?

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>
           Away from here.

Dan produces a couple beers from his pockets.     Offers
Martin one.

<b>                            MARTIN
</b>
             Pisswater.

<b>                           DAN
</b>
             At least it's cold pisswater.
             Here's to getting away.
They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the
airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas.
BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING.
Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the
ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks.

<b>                           DAN
</b>
             That was bad.
                     (bummed)
             It's gonna take all day to get
             another bus here.
Martin sighs, looks out the window.




<b>WHAT MARTIN SEES
</b>
A car rental place.







<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket.

<b>                           MARTIN
</b>
             You have a license?

<b>                             DAN
</b>
             Had one.    They took it away.

<b>                            MARTIN
</b>
             I got one.   Let's go.




<b>INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
Dan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out
Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth.

<b>                             DAN
</b>
             See that?    They're all fake.

             face?




<b>                           DAN
</b>
             A fist. My stepdad socked me. I
             flew across the room and dented
             the sheetrock in the kitchen. My
             mom saw everything and still took
             his side.

<b>                           MARTIN
</b>
             You got cracked good.

<b>                           DAN
</b>
             I hate that guy. Two hundred
             pounds of worthless grease.

<b>                           MARTIN
</b>
             Why'd he hit you?

<b>                           DAN
</b>
             I wrecked his sixty-five Mustang
             and his boat in the same week.
             His babies. I totaled them.

<b>                           MARTIN
</b>
             I would have popped you too.

<b>                           DAN
</b>
             It was worth it. But I didn't
             deserve the tour in hell.
Dan rubs his close-cropped hair.

<b>                           DAN
</b>
             Don't ever go to military school
             if you can help it. It sucks.
                     (a beat)
             I jumped the wall two days ago.

<b>                           MARTIN
</b>
             You going back?

<b>                           DAN
</b>
             I'm done with that racket. I'm
             going to Seattle and playing
             music.
Martin tries the guitar, he's not that good.

<b>                           MARTIN
</b>
             I know some chords.

<b>                           DAN

<b>INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - DAY
</b>



The land rolls endlessly. Martin drives.      Dan plays his
guitar. He's really good.

<b>                        DAN
</b>
          I'm the next Billy Squire. Krokus
          will be opening for me one day.
POW! The CAR HITS a BOTTLE. A front tire deflates.
Martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb.




<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
The middle of nowhere.    Martin flips a coin.    Heads.

<b>                          DAN
</b>
          Shit.
Dan hauls the spare from the trunk.      Sets the jack under
the bumper.
A PICKUP TRUCK approaches.      Still a mile away.
Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron.
The pickup gets closer, a big one.      Heavy with bags of
animal feed. Speeding.
Martin looking at Dan's back. Martin shoves Dan hard,
into the highway. In front of:







<b>THE GRILL OF THE PICKUP
</b>
WHAM! It plasters Dan. He goes over the hood, SHATTERS
the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins like a rag doll
into a ditch.
The pickup has lost control, it rolls.      Several times, a
heaving mass of steel.
CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself around a husky tree.         No
survivors, that's clear.




<b>MARTIN
</b>
He can't believe what he has just done.       He takes in the
carnage, tugs at his ear.

<b>EXT. ST. LAWRENCE RIVER - DAY
</b>



A large Ferry plies the unstoppable waters.     Gliding
toward skyscrapers.







<b>EXT. FERRY PIER - DAY
</b>
The signs in French. Crowded with PASSENGERS waiting to
board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the just-docked ship.
A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her
face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a
row of restaurants. Even in her turmoil, she is
patrician, elegant.







<b>EXT. PIER-SIDE CAFE - DAY
</b>
Two BEAT COPS eat at an outdoor table.   Laid back.    The
WOMAN approaches them, frantic.

<b>                        WOMAN
</b>
          I just saw my dead son get off the
          ferry.
The COPS trade looks.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>
          Listen to me; he's been dead
          eighteen years. He just walked
          right past me.




<b>INT. MONTREAL PD OFFICE - DAY
</b>
An INSPECTOR pours the Woman tea. She has calmed down.
He takes his pen, looking at her statement.

<b>                        WOMAN
</b>
          You need to open that grave.   It
          can't be my son in there.
A beat.

<b>                        INSPECTOR
</b>
          I lost my mother two years ago.
          Every day I think I see her.
          Driving to work in the car next to
          me. At mass. Shopping, I see
          her, but this is someone else's
          mother. You see?
The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye.
There is something formidable about her.

             Inspector, I'm saddened by your
             loss and touched by loyalty. But
             let's focus on the matter at hand.
             He walked right past me. We made
             eye contact. I know he recognized
             me. It was my son. A mother
             knows these things. I will sign
             anything, I will swear before a
             judge. And thank you, I do have
             all my faculties and friends who
             can vouch for my character.

<b>                           INSPECTOR

             Did you talk to this man, he is a
             man now?

<b>                           WOMAN
</b>
             Yes. Of course he's a man. He'd
             be thirty-two. And no, I did not
             speak with him. I ran.
                     (low, serious)
             Inspector, my son was very, very
             disturbed. He had serious
             emotional problems. I assure you
             he was.
                     (a beat)
             Is. Is a dangerous person.
He hands her some forms.

<b>                           INSPECTOR
</b>
             Madame. The police department
             cannot resolve your problem. You
             need to get permits from the
             coroner and health and safety
             department. You pay for an
             exhumation. You have someone
             qualified examine the remains. If
             it is the wrong body, the Forensic
             Examiner will confirm there is a
             problem and call us. Then we open
             an investigation.
                     (a beat)
             No, Quebec City police will
             investigate. He is buried there,
             no?
The Woman bristles.     Stands, takes the forms.

             No.   Inspector. He is not.

Deep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river.        A
log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION

<b>WORKERS.
</b>



A BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a
wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly,
hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE
OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the
headless body he has just dragged from its grave.
Workers gather and gawk.

closer.
CLICK!     A FLASHLIGHT turns on.   REVEALING:

GRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was
discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the
soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up.
Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from
the bright light.

The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot.    Laval
gestures for them to walk down the road.




<b>ON GRACE
</b>
She steps out of the grave. Sits by it. Writes some
notes. Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive.
Grace takes it in for a beat.
Then:   HOWLING, the lonely song of a distant WOLF.
Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar.
Used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. Grace
sits by the fire pit.
More HOWLING, CLOSER this time.
Grace looks down river, SEES the glowing eyes of a TIMBER
WOLF staring from a clump of trees. The animal stares a
beat, then runs off. Grace has the chills.
Grace walks quietly toward the trees. Grace just a few
feet away. RUSTLING. She cautiously moves aside a
sapling.







<b>EXT. RIVERBANK - GRACE'S FLASHLIGHT - NIGHT

A TIMBER WOLF nestled amidst the trees gnaws on
something; a HUMAN HEAD.




<b>EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT
</b>
Grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone. She
stoops, pushes aside brush. She finds a hollow under
some roots. Grace CLICKS on her FLASHLIGHT.




<b>WHAT SHE SEES

A human skull stares up from the hollow.     Picked clean,
weathered.

<b>EXT. DIRT ROAD IN THE FOREST - NIGHT
</b>



Laval and Reynaud, and the two UNIFORMS smoke and joke.
A quiet beat as the WIND picks up. Their cars up the
road in the b.g.



SOMETHING MOVES in the woods.   Inspector Reynaud draws
his Glock. SHUSHES the men.
A beat. MOVEMENT. Laval signals for the men to spread
out. Holsters are UNSNAPPED. Reynaud is all eyes and
ears as he picks his way toward the trees.
GRACE emerges from the trees, a laser-aiming dot on her
forehead. She REACTS to Reynaud, raises her hands.

<b>                        GRACE

          Don't shoot, I'm on your team.

Laval REACTS.




<b>INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY
</b>
Gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box. The
MEDICAL EXAMINER places the skull on an exam table and
begins cleaning it.
Grace walks around the headless body. The wetsuit has
been removed, the body has been autopsied. Headless,
skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved.
DIRECTOR GILLET is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar.    He's a
cop's cop and all-around nice guy.

          You only have one victim. Usually
          there's two or three by the time I

             The Mayor wants closure. That's
             his vacation house they were
             building. I get calls from
             supervisors I didn't know I had.

             We cleared the Mayor. He read the
             article on you in Newsweek and
             insisted we fly you up. The
             papers say two campers had a
             drunken fight and the loser lost
             his head.

             This was not a heat of the moment
             killing. And the victim was
             buried complete with head. The
             grave was five-foot ten. The
             victim's height. With square
             corners. Dug with a shovel the
             killer had the foresight to bring.

             Thirty-five detectives searched

             No. A large canine did that.
             Probably an old or sick timber
             wolf that couldn't hunt. It dug
             up the body and chewed off the
             head. It felt safe in the trees,
             away from the riverbank, away from

The Medical Examiner opens the bag. Removes a wig. No,
not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp.
Tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied
to two pieces of broomstick. The Photographer SNAPS some
shots.
The Medical Examiner gingerly untangles the cord.

             No. Look at it, braided parachute

             You approach the victim from
             behind, loop it around his head
             and hold on for all your might.
             The more the victim struggles, the
             quicker he passes out. And now
             you have convenient handles to

             rough profile; white male, thirty
             to thirty-four. Has some college
             but no degree. Neat in
             appearance. At least six feet
             tall. Very intelligent. Charming
             when necessary. He uses murder as
             a tool, probably in furtherance of
             a criminal endeavor. He's killed
             before and will again unless
             caught.

The lights are still on, Grace has fallen asleep on her
bed, still in her clothes, paperwork everywhere. Case
photos now fill the picture frames, cover the walls, even
on the ceiling. KNOCKING at the door. Grace stirs.



Crosses to the door, groggy. She checks the peephole.
Cracks the door. It's Inspector Laval.

Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the
back of a cop car.

          That's him.   He says he saw the

Reynaud SLAPS the cop car, it quickly drives away. Grace
and Laval arrive at a BODY dressed in sweats. A gym bag
nearby. A pair of UNIFORMS stand guard as a CRIMINALIST
processes the body. Thirty-ish, healthy, his generic
looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. Face bruised.

JOHN COSTA, 33, sits at the small table. Glasses,
moppish hair. Laval sits across from him. Costa is
sincere, and frightened.

          car. I'm unlocking it and I hear
          a scuffle, a fight. Over by this
          car I see this guy getting choked
          from behind and I shouted.

<b>                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          What did you shout?

<b>                        COSTA
</b>
          'Stop.' I ran towards them. Then
          the person doing the choking lets
          go and pointed a gun at me and
          ran. I'm so stupid. I could of
          been shot. I called the police
          gave him CPR until the paramedics
          came.

forward, looks Inspector Laval in the eye.

             from a parking lot. She kicked
             off a mirror, broke a window,

Grace opens it and finds a compact Glock.       She checks it,
shoves it into her pocket.
Reynaud swerves into the wrong lane. Stops cold in front
of an apartment building. And gets out. Great driving.
A mere two blocks away from the crime scene.       Laval gets
out. Then Grace.

An upper floor. Grace, Reynaud and the MANAGER cross to
a door. The Manager studies Costa's sketch of the
attacker.




<b>                        SUPER
</b>
          I never met him. We conducted our
          business by phone.
They arrive at a door. Reynaud about to knock.   Grace
stops him, listening at the door.

</b>
          I smell smoke. Back where I'm
          from anyone can kick a door if
          there's a fire. It's the
          'citizen's arrest' of search
          warrants.
Then: The SMOKE ALARM inside the apartment BUZZES O.S.
Reynaud and Laval trade looks. Reynaud cocks a leg...
The Manager unlocks the door a beat before Reynaud kicks
it. Laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to
enter. Grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows
what she's doing.




<b>INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
It's dark, drawn shades. A small studio. Reynaud and
Grace move tactically with drawn guns. Grace enters the
kitchen. Light smoke.
Reynaud approaches the futon, a person-sized shape under
the blankets. Reynaud whips aside the blanket. Just
pillows.
Grace checks under the sink.
Reynaud checks the bathroom and shower.
A coffee pot smokes, SIZZLING sludge on the bottom.
Grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one
lurks in there.

          Clear.
Grace turns off the burner. She crosses to a window,
whips aside the curtains, and opens it. Coughing.

          Ugh.   Got a lung full.

             middle of breakfast.
Laval has entered, he stares out the window.      Grace looks
out the window, REACTS.




<b>WHAT GRACE SEES
</b>
The apartment window has a perfect view of the gym
parking lot where the killing occurred.

Reynaud sees that and also REACTS.

             Which looks like all the victims.
             Maybe he's subconsciously killing
             himself.
Grace finds a guitar case. Opens it. It's a mobile
office; it has postage stamps. Postcards. Assorted
stationery, different address labels. Neat, organized.
Holiday cards. A CD titled: "Learn Flamenco Guitar."
Hundreds of practice signatures. Forged documents.

the kitchen table.

             has been following him, filming
             him for weeks. He tapped his
             phone and has recordings of Ford's

             Pretty cavalier attitude for a man
             who just got his ass chewed by his

             I can't turn it off.




<b>EXT. ART GALLERY STREET - NIGHT

A warm night, people are out. TEENS, COUPLES. Some OLD
MEN argue politics. Grace approaches the gallery, keeping
a low profile as she finds an angle to look inside.

John Costa shares some Merlot with a statuesque ELEGANT
WOMAN. She's laughing, flirting. Costa is making her
laugh.

An OLDER MAN joins them, the woman is his arm candy.
Costa shakes his hand. The Older Man and the Elegant
Woman exit.







<b>INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Grace enters. Costa sees her, REACTS, genuinely glad to
see her. And that throws Grace a beat. She really likes
his smile.

Grace looks over the art.

<b>                        COSTA

          Toussant Jean Bernard. I met him
          in Haiti last year. Very troubled
          life. Outlived all his children.
          And he had ten. He lost his wife
          to cancer and went blind. Passed
          away last year.

<b>                        GRACE

          Overpriced folk art. Is it the
          work of a soul that has suffered?
          Sure. Are his explorations as an
          artist groundbreaking? No.

<b>                        COSTA
</b>
          Ouch. And I was going to send you
          two and charge them to your Amex.

<b>                        GRACE

Costa is looking at her, looking through her.

             Medical school. Before I dropped
             out. I had a moment of clarity:
             in anatomy class I realized I'd
             rather draw bodies than cut them
             up. And when I realized I couldn't
             make art, I decided to sell it.

Grace will; she exits.




<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

reads a phone bill taped to a lamp. Circles a number
that keeps reappearing.







<b>INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (6:03 A.M.)

The place is gearing up for a new day. Grace crosses to
where Laval and Reynaud struggle awake with coffee and
the morning paper. Grace takes a seat, grabs the sports

crosses.

             Nothing. I think he became
             Edwards a year ago. He was a
             software engineer. Did everything
             by the internet, he never met
             anyone face to face.
Grace trades Reynaud for the front page.

<b>                           GRACE

             Why a year ago.

<b>                           INSPECTOR LAVAL
</b>
             Edwards went on a river trip.
             Kohler was a guide.
Grace REACTS.     Laval tosses her some papers.

<b>                           INSPECTOR LAVAL
</b>
             Those are E-mails between Kohler
             and Edwards discussing the trip
             one year ago.

<b>                           GRACE

             Our suspect kills Kohler on the
             river, lives his life a year,
             kills Edwards and assumes his ID
             for a year. Then he stalks Ford,
             kills him but is interrupted by
             Costa. Think he's pissed at

<b>                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Of course.

             To lose one son so young, then to
             lose the other two years later; to
             think you've lost him. That must

eye.

<b>                           MRS. ASHER

             Reese was very charismatic and
             outgoing. Martin was introverted.
             He never thrived like Reese. He
             was a very disturbed young man.
             Reese was Martin's world. Martin
             never recovered his equilibrium
             after we lost him. He changed.
             Martin began to intimidate me. He
             could be very menacing. He began
             imitating Reese at school and that
             lead to fights with other
             students. At sixteen he stole
             some jewelry that was very
             precious to me and ran away. A
             few days later the Thunder Bay
             police called and said my son had
             been killed changing a tire.

A cheap wood coffin sits on a gurney. The lid has been

Reynaud looks ill.

The body has been moved to the exam table. Covered with

Medical Examiner pulls a plastic bag from the coffin.

Five XL-sized COPS pump iron before their shift.

She's doing sit-ups on a decline bench, holding a 25-

Intense. The cops can't help but to be impressed.

             She didn't have one picture of

             out of the old yearbooks. And she
             had a basement door like a vault.
             She's hiding something. In the
             basement of her house. What is
             it, ten minutes away from here?
             Her house.
A beat.   Laval looks at Grace, decides he can trust her.

pockets a lockpick gun.

Grace enters with a flashlight and a pistol. She
cautiously clears each room until she is sure she is

Grace crosses to the hallway. The little dog is there.
GROWLING. Grace tosses it a hamburger patty.

<b>INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Grace descends CREAKING STOPS. Shining her light around.
Old boxes. Furniture. Forgotten things. Dust.
Grace is looking for something and she's not sure what.
She spots a door chain. She moves some boxes. Finds a
leather razor strop hanging next to a small door.
Grace's hand undoes the chain. Lifts the latch and opens
the door as rusted HINGES SQUEAL.




<b>INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT
</b>
Grace moves aside cobwebs with her big flashlight. The
room is tiny. Exposed joists overhead. Grace sits on
the cold concrete. A sleeping bag rolled in the corner.
One wall is just chicken wire. Her flashlight beam stabs
at the yawning darkness beneath the house.
There is a public school desk chair combo. The name
MARTIN neatly carved into it, then scratched out. A
broken light bulb overhead, its wires running to a corner
of the house.
Grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag. A pair of
socks, underwear, T-shirt neatly folded inside. She
rolls it back up. Finds a large jar, picks it up. Very
old feces inside, a makeshift toilet. She sets it down.
Grace pulls the door shut.   And turns off her flashlight.
Pitch black. So quiet.
She sits there, in the musty little cage. Listening to
her BREATHING, to her HEART BEAT. So lonely, so
frightening. A tear rolls down her cheek. She SNIFFLES,
wipes away the tear. A beat. Grace hears SCRATCHING.
She clicks on her light.







<b>GRACE'S FLASHBACK - INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT

YOUNG MARTIN ASHER IS HUDDLED in the corner, shivering,
CRYING and WHIMPERING. Martin looks AT us with haunted
eyes.

herself. Grace feels the chicken wire. MORE SCRATCHING.
Grace freezes. Listening carefully. Mice?

She swings her flashlight on:       TWO FIERY EYES.
WHAM! Something big slams into the chicken wire. Teeth
flashing, GROWLING. It's a BADGER. Grace almost shoots
it. The fearless beast GROWLS.
Grace kicks the door open and runs out of there.

the BODY ARMOR he is wearing.

<b>INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (1:29 AM)

Ultra-hip. The dance floor THROBS with CLUBGOERS.      THE
DJ THUMPS a EUROBEAT.
Costa sits at the bar. PEOPLE all around him, jostling
to buy drinks. Two busy BARTENDERS sling booze.
Costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve-
wracking. He twirls the ice in his Scotch with a finger.
Staring at the clock. 1:31 AM. He's nervous, sweat
beads his forehead. A big BARTENDER, an undercover cop,
pours Costa a Scotch.

<b>                         BARTENDER
</b>
          Don't worry.   You're doing fine.

          Could I have some water?    I'm

Costa scratches around the neck of the hot BODY ARMOR.
The Bartender gives him a Dasani.
VARIOUS ANGLES: A half-dozen UNDERCOVERS are mixed in
with the CLUBGOERS.
CAMERA FINDS Reynaud sitting at the bar near Costa, gives
Costa a reassuring nod through the crowd.

<b>INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (2:03 AM)
</b>
Costa looks miserable. Overheating, anxiously nursing
his water. He looks around. Then REACTS. A note sits
on the bar top. Right in front of him. Costa looks
around. Only sees strange faces.
Costa carefully unfolds the note.       It reads:   "MEET ME IN

<b>THE RESTROOM NOW."
</b>







<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Costa walks down a narrow hallway. Paint peeling.        MUSIC
MUTED. Red light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.
Approaching the men's room, Costa looks over his
shoulder. No one is watching.




<b>INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Costa cautiously pushes open the door. Stepping inside.
Dingy tiles. DRIPPING FAUCET. Several stalls.
The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends down.
Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing...
Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's
shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door.
Waiting...
Costa freezes.     Backs away as...
The stall door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK.        A
foot, a trouser cuff. A leg stepping out...

A BLACK MAN emerges.       One of the guys at the end of the
bar. Costa exhales.        A bundle of nerves.

Costa bursts from the fire exit, fed up. He rips off the
wire, he struggles out of the body armor. Grace and
Laval watching.

<b>                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             days before the accident.

<b>                           GRACE
</b>
             I'm sure Soulsby's death was a
             homicide, Asher saw the
             opportunity and took it. He
             became Soulsby and bummed around
             Seattle for a couple years.

<b>                           DIRECTOR GILLET
</b>
             Why is Asher after Costa? Why
             isn't he in Mexico getting a new
             face?

<b>                           GRACE
</b>
             Costa saw him. Costa caught him
             in the act, caught him being
             Martin Asher. Seen first by his
             mother, then by Costa. For the
             first time he's failed at taking a
             life, and since we found the
             apartment, he can't be Edwards.
             To be seen, to be recognized, is a
             horrifying thing to Asher. He has
             no identity and wants it that way.

<b>                           DIRECTOR GILLET
</b>
             Where is the real Mr. Edwards?

<b>                            GRACE

             Likely dead and buried south of
             the border somewhere.
                     (beat)
             South of the American border
             somewhere. Visa records put
             Asher, using Kohler's ID and
             Edwards at a Mexican surf resort.
             Edwards' last charge was sixteen
             hundred dollars at a 'no questions
             asked' facelift clinic in
             Guadalajara.
Director Gillet taps out his pipe.     Looks at a new, more
detailed portrait of Asher.

             thanks to money from Edwards.

Lost in thought. He studies a series of vivid paintings
leaning against the wall. He crosses. Changes the
order. Steps back. Something isn't right.

             I'm trying to get into the show,
             but I mean. What is this? It
             looks like somebody napalmed the
             Garden of Eden.

<b>                            COSTA

             Mangos.   Ripe mangos hanging on a

Now she sees it.

<b>                           GRACE
</b>
             Oh. Okay. Why the borders?
             Almost every painting has one.
             Was he in prison or something?
Costa REACTS, impressed by Grace.

<b>                           COSTA
</b>
             Most people don't notice. This is
             from his prison series. He could
             see a mango grove through his cell
             window. He made some of the
             pigments himself. From flowers.
             From his own blood.

             What was his crime?

</b>
             He attacked his neighbor with a
             machete. There was a woman
             involved.

<b>                             GRACE

             Always is.

A few minutes later Costa finds Grace at the turntables
looking through the DJ's records.

Costa finishes, washes his hands.        Pauses.    Smoothes his
hair.

</b>
Costa looks in the mirror and REACTS.
MARTIN ASHER stares at him from the mirror. No doubt who

at Reynaud and FIRES. POP-POP-POP-POP! Reynaud drops
and rolls out of the line of fire.

Asher bursts from the bathroom, running right over
Reynaud, who draws his pistol.
Grace pulls a pistol, Laval too. Asher running through
the patrons. Grace takes a knee and aims. She doesn't

he runs. People hit the deck.

his way through the safety glass. Grace and Laval
follow.

<b>ON GRACE

Running.   Equally tireless.      Locked onto Asher like a

ahead.
Asher shoves his hand in his pocket...

<b>BOOM!   BOOM-BOOM!     POP-POP-POP!

Thunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms
hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES.
It's not gunfire...

<b>TILT UP.

FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of
fire. Rivers of sparks.
Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought
she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for
Asher. Laval reaches her.

An UPSET WOMAN is in the hall, standing by the just-been
kicked-in door of her apartment. Grace and Laval charge
inside.

The SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the balcony has been shattered.

Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. A huge outdoor

ASHER jump from the far end of the roof.

Grace and Reynaud trade looks, tenacious street cops at
heart, they holster their guns and jump into the crowd.

A dozen yards away. He stalks a dancing RAVER who wears
a huge bundle of glowing necklaces.
Asher snatches necklaces.   Disappears into a wall of

<b>DANCERS.

<b>FIND GRACE --

She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace
GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud
tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a
bonding moment.
Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches
out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher
turns...

<b>IT'S NOT ASHER.
</b>
Grace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a
disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through
the crowd.
Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance.    They
cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal...




<b>A FIGHT
</b>
Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around;
no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the
Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in
and arrest the two Jocks.
Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration.    He looks at
Grace, they know they've been beaten.

It's Asher. His face is an evil green from his mane of
pilfered gel glow necklaces. Red plastic cup in hand,
Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity.







<b>ASHER'S EYES

Dangerous and cold.     They track Grace as she moves
through the crowd.
Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with

Grace searching the crowd.    Scanning faces.
Grace passes within feet of Asher.
Asher smirks.     Now another hottie wants a kiss.   Asher
complies.

A PLUMBER gets out.    Coveralls, clipboard.    Crosses to

Costa opens the door. With two packed bags.       Laval takes
one. Costa takes one last look at his home.       Locks the
door.
Laval watches the plumber KNOCKING a couple doors down.
Costa and Laval cross to unmarked #1.
The plumber approaches them.     Costa looking at him,

tree has caught fire.
Grace examines Costa, running her hands over Costa's
battered body.

          Nothing broken?

             Very dead.
Costa relaxes significantly. He realizes Grace is
holding him in his arms. So does Grace. It feels good.
A FIRE ENGINE heading to the crash passes them.




<b>EXT. FOREST CRASH SITE - DAY

Crime scene tape. POLICEMEN form a perimeter. The fire
is out. A Fire Truck pumps water for a three-man HOSE
TEAM cooling the hot metal. A plume of steam rises up
the scorched tree trunk.
The car is nothing more than blackened sheet metal.
Asher has been reduced to a charred torso.







<b>INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Reynaud sits by himself, his head between his knees.
Mourning Laval, dead on a nearby gurney. Director Gillet
crosses to him. Lays a comforting hand on Reynaud's
shoulder. Reynaud sees who it is, stands crisply, wipes
his tears, embarrassed.

tea. Nobody has been more comfortable. Costa pours beer
from a pitcher.

Grace is utterly unapologetic.      It makes Costa like her
even more.




<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Grace is in manic cleaning mode. She pulls papers off

Sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket.
She opens the door for Costa. He enters.        The room is
still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy.

             Growing up I quit speaking after

             forgotten real quick. So I'd
             watch people. Study them. The
             mouth can say anything, but the
             body doesn't lie. The tilt of the

Grace retreating. Step by step across the room. Costa.
Pursuing. Slowly. Determined. The heat. The immediacy

Costa grabs her. Pushing her. Up against the wall.            The

Two mouths. Inches apart. Costa's hand reaches up her
skirt. Exploring. Grace swallows. His hand reaching
into her panties.
Grace's eyes looking away. As she grabs his arm.
Pulling. Pushing. Wanting. Her mouth. Avoiding his.
Their breath mingling. Until. Costa's lips crush down
on hers. The kiss devouring. Knocking pictures off the
walls. Grace's hands pulling him closer.
Costa picks her up. Throws her on the bed. He tears at
her blouse. Her white lace bra. Grace's back arching.
Her legs wrapping around him. As her eyes flutter open.
Looking up at the ceiling, she gasps.
Costa stops. Turns. To see what she's looking at.
Surprised to see pictures of Asher's victims, the crime

Costa turns to Grace, whispers.

             Nineteen years ago I stood in this

             showed me a washtub full of blood
             and guts and told me it was my

attack.

                  (thinks a beat)
          Asher taunted Hart into a
          confrontation. Jesus. It was
          right there in my face. I was
          interpreting behavior from two
          different suspects.







<b>BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
</b>

<b>                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          He had us all fooled, Grace. All

          else can he do?

<b>                        GRACE
</b>
          Anything he wants.
KNOCKING. Gillet stands, crosses, opens his door. Two
FBI SUPERVISORS enter. Grim, silver-haired. Grace
stands.

<b>INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
Grace is on the spot.     Her LAWYER by her side.
Facing a panel of seven SENIOR AGENTS.     Microphones,
water pitchers.

<b>                           SENIOR AGENT
</b>
             Have your rights been explained to
             you and has an indication to that
             effect been made in your employee
             record?

<b>                           GRACE
</b>
             Yessir.







<b>INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Grace is exhausted, but holding up well.     The questions
don't stop.

<b>                           SENIOR AGENT
</b>
             Agent Vanderholt. Why would Asher
             kill Ford, if nobody knew he was
             Costa. If he wasn't going to use
             Ford's identity?

<b>                           GRACE
</b>
             He needed a murder he could link
             not only Richard Hart to but also
             to his past victims.




<b>FLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Upscale Euro-hip. Hart SLAMS down the phone.        Shoves a
gun in his belt and exits.

<b>                           GRACE (V.O.)
</b>
             Hart's behavior was consistent
             with a disorganized drug addict
             following the rules of the
             criminal road by attempting to
             kill a debtor who won't pay. He
             had no idea he was being
             manipulated by a serial killer.

</b>



Asher enters through the front door.   Hart isn't home.




<b>INT. HART'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>



Asher steals floss from the garbage can.   Takes Hart's
toothbrush. Some dirty laundry.

<b>                        GRACE (V.O.)
</b>
          Asher wasn't becoming disorganized
          and decomposing into madness, he
          was evolving.







<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
Asher, his face obscured with a sweatshirt hood, pulls
Todd Ford from the trunk.

<b>                        GRACE (V.O.)
</b>
          The Ford murder was staged and I
          missed it. Asher drove Ford's car
          there with Ford unconscious in the
          car. Ether maybe, GHB. Something
          that disappears. Asher works out,
          heads to the parking lot. Pulls
          Ford out of the trunk. And
          strangles him. He left a couple
          of Hart's hairs on the body.
Asher leans over Todd Ford, strangling the unconscious
man with the garotte.
Asher places a couple of Hart's hairs on the body.




<b>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Asher drawing the sketch of who we now know was Hart.     Is
that a sly grin Asher has?

<b>                        GRACE (V.O.)
</b>
          He draws a nice portrait of Mr.
          Hart and he's now inside the heart
          of Montreal PD's investigation.




<b>INT. ASHER'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
In the bathroom, Asher, wearing surgical gloves, places
Hart's comb in the medicine cabinet. Puts Hart's trash
in the wastebasket.

</b>




<b>                           GRACE (V.O.)
</b>
             Evidence at the Ford crime scene
             led to an apartment with more of
             Hart's DNA. And evidence linking
             Hart to Asher's crimes. Hart
             never set food in that apartment.
             Asher staged everything.




<b>EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Grace chasing Hart.

<b>                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)
</b>
             Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the
             Montreal Inspector, correct?

<b>                           GRACE (V.O.)
</b>
             Yes. Hart thought Costa was
             systematically destroying his
             life. Hart's violent explosion
             was inevitable.

<b>                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)
</b>
             How could Asher plan on Hart
             snapping like that?

<b>                           GRACE (V.O.)
</b>
             He couldn't. My guess is Asher
             intended to kill Hart and make it
             look like suicide. The
             authorities would find the body
             and close the Martin Asher file.

             This ethics panel has no choice
             but to recommend terminating you
             for misconduct. Do you wish to
             make a statement?
Grace shakes her head: no.

<b>                           SENIOR AGENT
</b>
             Please speak up for the record.
Grace leans into her mike.

Grace does the walk of shame in front of her former
COLLEAGUES. She carries a cardboard box full of personal
stuff from her office. Two GSA POLICE escort her.







<b>EXT. QUANTICO PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
Grace heaves the box into the back of her Audi.   A GSA

DICK COLTON, her ex-boss intercepts her before she gets
in.

</b>
          You'll manage.

<b>                           GRACE

Grace gets in her car.

<b>                        COLTON
</b>
          No one has any clue where Asher
          is. That son of a bitch might
          fixate on you. Please watch your
          back, Grace.

<b>                        GRACE
</b>
          I'll dig a hole and hide in it.

<b>                        COLTON
</b>
          Don't fade away, Grace.   You're
          still my friend, okay?
Grace pulls out.   Heads for the road that will take her
out of Quantico.

<b>INT. ECONOMY MOTEL - NIGHT

Grace watches TV in the dark.      Drinking a beer.
Her CELL RINGS. Grace looks at it.        Sees OUT OF AREA on

A beat.   Grace grabs the big .45 by her thigh.

There is a strange tension in her voice. She hangs up.
Turns off the TV. She gets off the bed, crosses to a
corner. She sits, settles in for a long vigil.




<b>INT. ECONOMY MOTEL - DAY
</b>
The rising sun reveals Grace has not moved. She is now
realizing Asher isn't going to show. Grace drops the .45
and begins to cry.

Grace exits the clinic reading a test result.      She

Gallons of spaghetti sauce. Stocking up.

<b>EXT. WAREHOUSE STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>



Wintertime. It's an ice storm. Freezing rain
accumulates on existing snow and ice. Grace loading her
supplies into her truck. It's miserable out and getting
worse.



HONKING. Grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding
helpless across the ice. It stops just short of hitting
a parked car.




<b>INT. POST OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
Ten minutes later Grace checks her P.O. Box. Finds some
baby catalogs. A local PREGNANT WOMAN enters.

Old and falling apart. Overgrown with branches. The
wind picking up. Grace's truck slowly navigating the
ice. The only vehicle around.




<b>INT. GRACE'S TRUCK - MOVING - NIGHT

The accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly. Grace
drives with extreme caution, picking through the ice in
low gear. She drives around a fallen tree branch.

             absolute emergency. Several of
             their cruisers have already been
             damaged. There is ice everywhere.
             On the way in tonight I saw the
             snowplow slipping and sliding.
             Everybody, stay where you are.

<b>SOMETHING MOVING.

<b>WHAM!

Her WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.     Grace REACTS.
A tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her
truck.
The truck slides across the ice. Grace fights to regain
control, to keep it out of the ditch.
Grace stops.     Gets out.   Pulls the branch off the hood.




<b>EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
The last remnant of the once-proud Vanderholt holdings.
Grace pulls open a large garage door.
Assaulted by rain and sleet. She slips on the ice.
Regains her feet, finishes opening the door.
She gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage.

Restored. Filled with family heirlooms.      Another family
that has decayed from glory.
Grace enters. Dripping wet. She turns OFF the ALARM.

Grace crosses to the kitchen.

Asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down
into a chair. She throws a punch. Asher blocks it.
Asher yanks on her cuffed arm.       SMACK!   Grace slaps him.
Asher pulls her into a chair. CLICK! Grace is now
cuffed to the chair. She struggles futilely against the

             I searched everything.
Asher stands, reaches for the Glock on the counter.
Grace can't let him get it. She lunges at Asher,
collides into his knees, hurting him.

<b>                          ASHER
</b>
             Damn you!
Asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block.
THWACK!   Plunges it into Grace's belly.
Grace GASPS, looking at the knife embedded in her stomach.
A beat as Grace and Asher stare at the knife.
Grace uses the pause to kick away from Asher.       She gets
on her feet and runs from the kitchen.

<b>EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>



Grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands
cuffed behind her. Running for her life.
She runs for the nearby woods. Her shoes CRUNCHING
through a layer of fresh ice over old snow. Fighting for
balance.
POP-POP-POP! Asher OPENS FIRE on her from the house.
BULLETS HIT the ice around her.
Grace runs into the woods.   Branches sheathed in ice.
Smacking her face.
Asher exits the house, FIRING -- POP-POP-POP-POP!
BULLETS EXPLODE the ice around Grace. She dives to the
ground. She takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs
from behind to in front.
She unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she
wears. Grace is not pregnant. She pulls the knife out.
Grace runs deeper into the woods.
Asher running in the woods behind her. The gun in his
hand at the ready. Asher is hunting. He intends to kill
her.

           Keep fucking running, Grace,
           you're only going to die tired!




<b>ON GRACE
</b>
Running. Batting away ice-covered branches.     Drenched
with sleet. Hypothermic conditions.







<b>EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
Grace emerges from the woods. Running along the icy
road. She slips and falls. Cuts her hand on the ice.
Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the
knife getting slippery.




<b>ON ASHER
</b>
Gaining on her. Grace slips again, scrabbling on the
ice, trying to keep moving. A slow motion nightmare.
Here comes Asher.   No mercy.   He aims the gun at her
face...

Grace raises her hands to protect her face...
POP! Asher FIRES. DING! The BULLET intended for
Grace's forehead hits the knife -- RICOCHETS into the
trees.
A beat.   Grace looking at the now-creased knife.
Asher's gun is out of rounds.     The slide is locked back
on an empty chamber.
SWICK! Grace slices Asher's legs with the knife.          Slices
each shin deeply.

<b>                          ASHER
</b>
             Shit!
Asher kicks the knife from her hand. Then kicks her in
the face. He tries to kick her again but she grabs his
leg.
WHAM! Asher slips, hits the ice hard. Grace is on top
of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck. Wraps her
legs around his body.
Grace chokes Asher for all he's worth. His eyes bulge,
his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his
victims. Asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted
brain dies.
Grace doesn't let go. A long death embrace. Finally,
when she is sure, Grace releases from Martin Asher's
body.
She checks his pulse.    He's dead.    Grace stands.
The rain falling on her. Ice and moonlight. Grace spits
blood, looks around. Looks at Asher's corpse.

<b>                           GRACE
</b>
             Better you than me, asshole.
Walks back toward the house.      Alone.   Strong.   Whole.




<b>                                              FADE OUT.
