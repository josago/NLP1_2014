          Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The

</b>          Oliver and Arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man
          dressed as a witch, complete with green face and long black
          hair, is lying back as if in a traditional analysis session.

           would ask for this? This color.
           This nose. This cheek, this chin.
           You know, this is my life. This
           isn't a story. This isn't a
           joke...
          Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally
          ready for this party. He feels very far away.

           for this week. Thank you for

          The witch moves on.
          Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this
          joviality.
          We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching
          him.
          Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down
          onto the couch, ready for her session.

</b>           Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a
           break, actually.
          She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious. Oliver can tell she's
          not going to give it up.

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>           (back in accent)
           Well, I guess we should start with
           your mother.
          The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver:
          "Never had one."

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>           Well then your father.

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>           I don't understand. You can't
           talk? Is it a mental problem? Do
           you need analysis?
          She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis"

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>           That's a physical problem.
          She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is
          more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes:
          "Why are you at a party if you're sad?"
          CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation.

          as Elliott interrogates him.

          Oliver exits his house alone, down his front stairs to the

          barking and howling. Oliver can't believe it.

          Anna suddenly leans in and kisses him. Before it goes to

          follows. While nothing has really been expressed between the
          two, Anna seems to understand the problem.

          She falters, looks at him vulnerably. Oliver abruptly kisses
          her. She pushes back. They pause. She traces his brow slowly
          with her index finger, the way she did their first night.

<b>          INT. HAL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Oliver walks into Hal's living room, carrying his full tray
          of medication.

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>           Here, Pop.

<b>                          HAL
</b>           Oh, God.

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>           I know, I know. Come on.
          Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his
          glass with a teaspoon as he swallows. The room is cluttered
          with books. Oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a
          paper-filled side table.

<b>                          HAL
</b>           Hey, no, no, no. That's the Gay
           Pride Day stuff. Just leave those.

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>           Alright.
          Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a
          chair.

<b>                          HAL
</b>           And that's for gay book club. You
           better leave those too.

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>           But what about this chair? Is it
           gay?

<b>                          HAL
</b>           The chair's not gay. Obviously.
          Hal gets up and walks to the kitchen, his oxygen cannon cord
          is attached to the pump behind him, stopping him short.

<b>                          HAL
</b>           Oh, to hell with it.
          Hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking, frail but
          determined. Andy enters with a large pilates ball.

<b>                          HAL
</b>           Oh, hey what's that?

<b>                          HAL
</b>           That's a great idea.

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           Okay, let's try it. I'll, I'll show

          Hal's still heading to the sink.

<b>                          HAL
</b>           Yeah, later on, I'm gonna make
           myself some tea.

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           Okay, I'll clean it up. It's a

          Andy walks out, Hal pours water into a kettle, in front of
          him on the window sill is the same vase from the first scene
          of the film, with some dead daisies in it.

          them in the basket Oliver holds.

          Oliver approaching with the weight of the world on his
          shoulders. Andy see's him, can immediately sense that
          something is wrong.

          Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he
          stops his workout. Oliver tries to find his words.

           sex with another man, he's always
           afraid of gay men. You know,
           they're a threat.
          Oliver's blown away by the logic.

           people wouldn't even call it sex.
          Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is
          relieved for him, Oliver is just confused.

           more treatments would just -- cause
           more pain.

          Juan steps away and grabs his mousse, puts a little in his
          hand and sits back down on Hal's bed. He begins to spread
          it gently through wisps of Hal's white hair. Oliver watches
          Hal close his eyes, and deeply enjoy this simple affection
          and camaraderie with another gay man.
