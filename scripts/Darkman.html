</b>          A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit

<b>                         CLOSE SHOT:
</b>          A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy
          but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe.
          His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough
          man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks.
          His name is EDDIE BLACK.
          In the distance a foghorn moans.
          We are pulling back.

<b>                         BLACK
</b>          Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell
          him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell
          fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh...
          The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge
          empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of
          his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty
          space.
          The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches
          falling into darkness.

</b>          No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy
          comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me
          outs my property... Does it matter?
          Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay...
          Another hard-looking man is approaching.

          swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln

          The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out,
          eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.

          Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies.

          hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them
          down and haul off iron -- lots of it.

          continues to hop in place for balance.
          Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is
          dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level.

          command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed

          programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic
          substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose.

          being laid into the palms downtown.
          You're not naive; you know
          it's a cost of doing business.
          Ordinarily you don't have to face it.

          Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of

<b>                         STRACK
</b>          Take a look at that model, Julie.
          That was my father's dream. Now it's
          my dream. Acres of riverfront
          reclaimed from decay, thousands of
          jobs created, a building block--a very
          large building block--laid for the
          future. Not such a bad dream, as
          dreams go. And if the price of
          realizing that dream is the occasional
          distasteful chore, well...

</b>          All right, you're point is well taken.
          But the fact remains that I'm in
          possession of evidence of the
          commission of a crime. You can no
          more ask me to destroy it than I could
          ask you to destroy one of your

</b>          Of course, there are serious emotional
          side effects to this operation. When
          the body ceases to feel, when so much
          sensory input is lost, the patient
          becomes alienated. The mind, cut off
          from its regular diet of input, has a
          never-satisfied thirst; alienation
          gives rise to loneliness, anger;
          uncontrolled rage is not uncommon.
          And the rage problem is exacerbated by
          the chemical effect of severing the
          nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow
          unchecked through body and brain--
          giving him the strength of dozen men.
          Hence the leather restraints.

          returns the mask to the bag, then slips it into his

          Perfect., Handsome. But as for the rest...
          The 3i,a is a hairless skull, covered with random bits of
          scaranf char. Without the benefit of gums or lips, the
          entire 3ength of his teeth are exposed down to the root,
          connec g crookedly to the jaw bone. One ear remains
          intact, the other a burnt hole. Only the rudimentary
          cartile forms the nose. But it is the wild eyeballs
          protruig obscenely from the bone of their sockets, that
          tell tba,story. There, lies madness; a dark river of evil

          Strackâ€ž naked except for a monogrammed bath towel
          wrapd around his thickening midriff, walks across
          the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment. A
          Mahler symphony plays in the background.
          He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that
          rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the
          strain of the load, he staggers back across the room
          to the king-sized bed.
          With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest
          out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands.
          They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over
          the sides and clatter to the floor.
          Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty,
          then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the
          floor.
          Like a swan he dives.
          He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against
          flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips.
          Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then
          slough off, leaving their imprint.
          Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving
          himself with the golden coins--
          A knock at the door.

</b>          Julie, how sweet of you to come before
          our appointed hour... but I expected--
          you in something a little more formal.
          Didn't Ruth inform you that we have

          against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening
          out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels
          away again. It spins downward towards a forest of
          reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes

          pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re-bars.

          He lifts him full into the air. Strack's legs and arms
          flail impotently.

<b>                         DARKMAN
</b>
<b>          ARRRRRRRGGGGGGG !
</b>          Darkman hurls him up, up into the air.
          463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463
          to fall, yards away from the girder.
          464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464
          on the rebars many floors below, next to Durant's face.

          HUMMING at the cut. Darkman and Julie are inside.
          Darkman remains turned from Julie, facing the shadows.
          Gently, Julie touches his shoulder to draw him toward
          her.

<b>                         JULIE
</b>          Peyton, I can help.

<b>                         DARKMAN
</b>          No one can help.

<b>                         JULIE
</b>          I don't care how you look, Peyton! I.
          love you. The burns don't matter.
          There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted
          remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in
          close-up.
          CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.

          Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She
          overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his.

<b>                         DARKMAN
</b>          It disgusts you.

<b>                         JULIE
</b>          No.
          Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.

<b>                         FINALLY:
</b>
<b>                         DARKMAN
</b>          This hand... it used to caress you.
          Now it can only tear, rip away at
          things.

          He grips his skull.

          He pulls the elevator open.

          He disappears into the darkness.

          Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:

</b>          Peyton is gone...
          466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466
          he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a
          construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other
          side.
          Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he
          slips into the pedestrian traffic.
          The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she
          desperately searches for him, turning people around,
          staring at their faces... It begins to snow.

          She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into
          alien faces in search of the man she loves.

<b>          AS WE ROLL END CREDITS
</b>          The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians,
          any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull
          back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards,
          wherever the crowd spills, into an alley... As a street-
          person shuffles into view:
