<b>EXT. KIDNET STUDIO -C - EVENING
</b>
A man in a puffy foam-rubber rhinoceros costume dancing
under the bright friendly lights of a television studio.
Another rhino and various foam-rubber animals dance
behind him to the happy MUSIC. The rhino finishes his
number and takes a bow. A bleacher full of kids bursts
into wild applause.


<b>INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
After the taping. The rhino lumbers down the hallway
toward wardrobe. He is suddenly grabbed by two large men
and dragged out through the exit into...


<b>INT. DARK PARKING GARAGE
</b>
... where several   thugs in overcoats emerge from the
shadows and start   beating him with lead pipes. One of
the men pulls out   a GUN and SHOOTS the rhino several
times. The SHOTS    REVERBERATE through the empty garage.

<b>INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY
</b>
It's the taping of another children's show -- "Rainbow
Randolph and the Krinkle Kids." RANDOLPH SMILEY, a
clean-cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie,
dances through Rainbowland with the "Krinkle Kids"
(little people in top hats). He sings one of his
signature songs: "Friends Come In All Sizes." One of
the main Krinkle Kids -- ANGELO PIKE -- dances behind
him.

<b>                         RANDOLPH
</b>                 (singing)
          'Friends come in all sizes
          That's a fact! It's True!
          All colors of the rainbow
            from Mauve to Blue...

             One might say 'grasp' while the

             Some like to toss while others

               never matters when you want some
               friendly patter
             From a pal who is true and can
               lift you when you're blue
             You can count on him and he can
               count on yoooouuuu!

<b>MONTAGE - RAINBOW RANDOLPH MERCHANDISE
</b>
"Sugar Rainbows Cereal," plastic toys lined up on store
shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating
"Rainbow Potato Chips" and "Rainbow Candies." A "Rainbow
Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows.
Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We
get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the
kid shows.


<b>INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT
</b>
A suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find
Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair
slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer
looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After
a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table
and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his
Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five
grand stares him in the face.

<b>                     HUSBAND
</b>             So... uh... you'll make sure my
             boy dances up front, right? Where
             he'll get the most camera time?

Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple.

<b>                     RANDOLPH
</b>             You want your kid on the show?

</b>             Yes, very much.

<b>                     RANDOLPH
</b>             Then don't tell me how to run my
             fucking business.

<b>                     HUSBAND
</b>             No, no, we were just --

Randolph rises. He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and
picks up the briefcase.

<b>                     RANDOLPH
</b>             I'll call you if a spot opens up.

He starts to walk off. Suddenly, the Husband and Wife
jump up from the table holding guns.

<b>                     HUSBAND
</b>             Freeze, you cocksucker!

<b>                     WIFE
</b>             Drop the briefcase!

Federal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph.


<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAWN
</b>
Bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb
from passing trucks.   The various headlines blare:

<b>"RAINBOW RANDOLPH BUSTED ACCEPTING BRIBE"
</b>
<b>"FCC PROBES KID SHOW BIZ"
</b>
<b>"CORRUPTION IN KRINKLELAND"
</b>

<b>INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY
</b>
The Rainbow Randolph/Krinkle Kid set is being dismantled.
Backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece
is wheeled off. Workers with push brooms sweep up tons
of glittery "magic Rainbow dust."

<b>INT. NETWORK BOARDROOM - KIDNET - DAY
</b>
We are TIGHT ON the sweating face of a MAN who looks like
he's about to be executed.

is standing at the end of a long conference table as the
NETWORK BRASS glares at him.

<b>                        STOKES
</b>             (addressing the brass)
          Gentlemen, let me be the first to
          say, in all sobriety, that I'm as
          shocked and outraged as all of --

The network CEO, a hog of a man, cuts him off.

<b>                  CEO
</b>          Save it for the papers, Stokes.
          We've got nervous sponsors and an
          angry public -- a combination
          uglier than two monkeys fucking.
          What are you doing about it?

<b>                  STOKES
</b>          Well, sir, I'm currently in the
          process of compiling a list of
          viable replacements and it's my
          hope...

<b>                  CEO
</b>          Clean replacements?    With
          background checks? I assure you,
          Mr. Stokes, this network cannot
          survive another Rainbow Randolph.
          The goddamn P.R. department looks
          like the Jim Jones camp.

Another EXECUTIVE chimes in.

<b>                  EXECUTIVE #1
</b>          Remember, Stokes, this was your
          dog that crapped on our rug.

<b>                        EXECUTIVE #2
</b>          We trusted you, Frank. And now
          we're in a tight spot. We have to
          post our quarterly earnings next
          month, for Christ's sake.

<b>                   CEO
</b>          Whoever takes that slot has to be
          a straight arrow. Clean as a
          whistle.

<b>                  EXECUTIVE #3
</b>          Right. Someone who'll take the
          heat off. One of those sweater
          types. Any chance of luring Fred
          Rogers away from P.B.S.?

             truck.

<b>                           EXECUTIVE #1
</b>             No way. The idea now is to stop
             the hemorrhaging.

<b>                           EXECUTIVE #2
</b>             You better fix this, Stokes. Get
             us a white bread replacement,
             fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a
             speck of controversy.

A giant hand slams on the table. All heads snap.
The CEO drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany.
Deafening sound.

<b>                     CEO
</b>                (calm and measured)
             Squeaky fucking clean.


<b>INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Stokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of
wine as he goes over potential Randolph replacements with
NORA BISHOP, his pretty protege.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             Bumble Bee Billy?

<b>                     NORA
</b>                (reading from a list)
             Wife beater.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             Square Dance Danny?

<b>                     NORA
</b>             Still appealing the mail fraud
             thing.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls?

<b>                     NORA
</b>             Black was deported, and the
             trolls... well, who gives a shit.

Nora kicks the table in frustration.

<b>                     NORA
</b>             This is impossible. If I ever see
             that Rainbow Randolph again I'll
             strangle him. Choke the life out
             of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck
             until his eyes pop out of his
             skull and bounce off the walls...

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             Before indulging such cheery
             fantasies, let's just concentrate
             on saving my job. Shall we?

<b>                     NORA
</b>             Sorry, Frank.

Stokes flips through a thick stack of files.      He suddenly
stops at one.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             What's going on with Sheldon Mopes
             these days.

Nora laughs.

<b>                     NORA
</b>             Oh my God. Have we sunk to that
             level already? Smoochy the Rhino?
             What a sap.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             Sap's just the pill we need right
             now. Mopes is a straight arrow.
             Always has been.

<b>                     NORA
</b>             The guy can't get arrested, Frank.
             He can't even break into the
             birthday party circuit. Last I
             heard he was working hospitals and
             nursing homes. He's a joke.

Stokes stands up and walks around the room.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             The truth of the matter is, a
             successful children's show has
             always depended on two simple
             elements: a fuzzy costume and a
             lot of hype. Strip away the foam
             rubber and the network money and
             they're all jokes. Marginal
             talents.. cabaret acts... off-
             Broadway runoff...

</b>
<b>                     NORA
</b>             I probably have ten acts in my
             development file -- acts I've been
             cultivating -- that are more
             deserving than Sheldon Mopes.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             And each one a moral question
             mark. Something I can't risk at
             the moment.

<b>                     NORA
</b>                (frustrated)
             We can do better than this guy,
             Frank. He brings nothing to the
             table.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             Except ethics. With Mopes,
             there's never been a whiff of
             controversy. The man's an
             ethical, harmless, cornball. In
             short, a glass of milk on two
             legs.

Stokes stops pacing.

<b>                     NORA
</b>             Don't ask me to do it. You know
             I'll do anything for you, but
             please... not this...

Stokes gazes out the window at the city.

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             Go find Smoochy.


<b>EXT. CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENING
</b>
The lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE
DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the
amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a
small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY
ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double
doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies
loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a
narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and
playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH
another set of doors marked "Treatment Room." The
singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the
"performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy.
Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the
patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass
window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of
methadone which they immediately drink.

The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam
rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front.
A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead.

<b>                     SMOOCHY (SHELDON)
</b>                (singing to the tune
                 of 'She'll be Comin'
                 round the Mountain')
             'We'll get that monkey off your
               back,
             Yes we will, yes we will
             We'll get that monkey off your
               back,
             Yes we will...'

             'We'll get that monkey off your
               back
             And get your life right back on
               track
             If you'll just give up the smack
             Yes you will, yes you will!!'

The song ends.       A few baffled junkies applaud.

<b>                     SMOOCHY
</b>             Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for
             you!

We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there in
her coat, looking mortified, is Nora.


<b>INT. RECEPTION AREA - SHORT WHILE LATER
</b>
Nora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his
street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger
over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which
holds Smoochy's head.

<b>                     NORA

<b>                      SHELDON
</b>             Really? Thanks. I would've done
             a longer set if that guy hadn't
             pulled a knife on the security
             guard. Once the pepper spray
             starts flyin', that's it for the
             encores.

Sheldon and Nora stand at the crowded counter at
Nathan's. Sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily-
garnished, oddly colored hot dog. Nora winces as
she watches him.

He takes another bite.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             So anyway, like I was saying,
             people always tell me, 'You gotta
             network, Sheldon... you gotta sell
             yourself... or you'll be playing
             the drug clinics and shopping
             centers the rest of your life.'
             And you know what I tell 'em?

<b>                     NORA
</b>             I haven't the foggiest.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             I tell 'em, it's not about the old
             handshake and back slap game.
             It's not about adding fuel to the
             shlock machine. It's about doing
             good work. Having integrity.
             Making people happy and delivering
             a positive message. Foundations
             are built with concrete, not
             plaster of Paris!

He pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the
shopping bag.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             This is concrete!   This is
             integrity!

</b>                (calmly)
             I can see that.

Sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             Sorry. As you can imagine, living
             by your convictions can be a
             little stressful at times.

KIDNET STUDIO WARDROBE ROOM. A team of designers and
seamstresses cut, sew and shape endless sheets of orange
foam rubber. Sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's
measured from head to toe. On the wall is a blueprint
labeled "Smoochy the Rhino -- REDESIGN."

A costume designer walks over with the new Smoochy head
and places it on Sheldon.

As seamstresses fit him with the new Smoochy costume,
various signs and billboards FLOAT THROUGH the FRAME,
trumpeting copy like: "IT'S ALMOST SMOOCHY TIME!"
<b>"GET READY TO BE SMOOCHED, AMERICA!" "ONLY TWO MORE

Sets, props, and camera equipment are rolled into the

Smoochyland Magic Jungle take shape.


<b>KIDNET STUDIO -C - LATER

A choreographer maps out a number for Smoochy and the
"Rhinettes." (The Rhinettes are the former Krinkle Kid
little people with horns strapped to their foreheads.)

number -- a catchy, bouncy song and dance routine that plays out
in the sugar-coated jungle of Smoochyland.

A disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock. The
Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b.g. A car pulls up in the
b.g. Stokes gets out. Randolph moves under an awning.

<b>                     RANDOLPH

<b>                     STOKES
</b>             I agreed to meet you, didn't I?    I
             had a dinner engagement.

Randolph takes a swig from a flask.

<b>                     RANDOLPH
</b>             Really? You know, I used to have
             dinner engagements. Sometimes
             four, five a night. Dinner...

             fucking town.

<b>                     STOKES

             Cars, boats, whores and horses, I
             had 'em all. When I walked into a
             restaurant, ten guys reached for
             my hat. When I stood up to take a
             piss, they cleared the rest room.
             I'd walk down the street and
             traffic stopped, mouths gaped.

             who earned for you? The guy who

             back and the pheasant au vin in

<b>                     STOKES

             each other.

Randolph suddenly breaks down.

</b>                (pleading)
             You gotta fix it, Frank. You
             gotta get me my slot back.

He now clings to Stokes' lapels.

</b>             How can I sit around while that
             rhinoceros... that horned

             Nothing. You're a pariah. I

             by the book. No skim, no
             percentage. Nothing. The network
             wanted squeaky clean and they got
             it. And believe me, Mopes is
             sparkling.

He looks Randolph squarely in the eye.

<b>                     STOKES

tie.

<b>                     STOKE
</b>             Don't contact me again, Randy.
             Ever.

Stokes walks off.    Randolph watches him disappear through
the mist.

<b>                           RANDOLPH
</b>             You'll get yours, Frank! The rhino
             too! Do you hear me?! The wheels

Stokes is gone. Randolph takes a swig from his flask and
wipes his chin with his sleeve. He stares out at the
river.

The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next

             Silly songs, sure -- but with a

<b>INT. PATSY'S - NIGHT
</b>
Sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a
drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly
drunk.

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          ... No, no, you misunderstand me.
          It's not that I'm literally
          comparing Captain Kangaroo to
          Jesus Christ. I'm just saying
          that the Captain, like Christ, was
          someone you could believe in.
          Those guys didn't care about bells
          and whistles and rickita-rackata.
          It was all about the work.
          Especially Jesus. Forget about
          it.

The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another
drink.

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>             (waving him off)
          That's okay, my good man.    Three's
          my limit.

<b>                  BARTENDER
</b>          I never saw anyone get loaded on
          orange juice before.

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          Back in my college days I could
          put away a carton of the stuff.

A sharply-dressed man, BURKE BENNETT, sits down next to
Sheldon.

<b>                  BURKE
</b>             (to Bartender)
          Gimme a Five Crown.

The Bartender nods.    He looks over at Sheldon.

Burke extends his hand.

Sheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table.

<b>                  BURKE
</b>          Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in
          the business to make you rich.
          He's in it to make Frank Stokes
          rich. That's how these network
          goons operate.

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          That's so sad. Is it just me, or
          is that sad?

<b>                  BURKE
</b>          You know, years ago, a client of
          mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a
          problem...

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?

<b>                  BURKE
</b>          Yeah, before the asshole found
          religion. Anyway, Stokes was
          trying to screw my boy out of some
          merchandising points. Claimed he
          had a warehouse full of Dicky
          dolls that weren't moving. Now
          Frank and I are old friends, so I
          say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me
          the warehouse' -- see, I know the
          fucking warehouse is in the Bronx,
          and I know it's emptier than my
          wife's head.
             (chuckles)
          To make a long story short, I walk
          out with a check for a hundred
          grand and Stokes is sitting there
          with his thumb up his ass.

Burke laughs.

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          That's very amusing, but I don't
          care about Smoochy dolls and
          Smoochy floor wax... I just want
          more creative input. This rhino
          came from my womb. I bore him, I
          nursed him, and dammit...

He pounds his fist on the table.

<b>                     BURKE
</b>             Shel, it's all about the dough.
             After you get the money, you get
             the power. And after you get the
             power, you can have Smoochy walk
             on stage with a hard-on if you
             want.

</b>             It's funny, that never crossed my
             mind.

Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up.

<b>                     BURKE
</b>             Unfortunately, until then...
             you're just another puppet in the

He hands Sheldon his card.

Randolph peers through the restaurant's front window. He
shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke
shake hands. Burke heads for the exit. Randolph quickly
ducks into the shadows. A moment later, Burke exits the
club and walks down the street. Randolph pops out.

Burke walks off.


<b>EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
In the litter-strewn alley, we PAN ACROSS several grocery
bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers,
mixing bowls and other baking ingredients. The PAN ENDS
ON Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a
spatula. A cookie sheet rests on the barrel. Randolph
removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully. We
now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped.

<b>                     RANDOLPH
</b>             Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect
             batch of cock cookies for a very
             special rhino.

He sets the tray aside.

<b>                     RANDOLPH
</b>             Oh yes, you're going to learn
             about shame, my dear Smoochy.   And
             I'm your professor.

He laughs.


<b>INT. KIDNET STUDIO - STAGE B - DAY

It's thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping. Dozens of
giddy children are led into the studio where they take
seats on the bleachers.


<b>BACKSTAGE

Sheldon, in the Smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to
Nora. He holds a rundown for that day's show.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             Excuse me, Nora. Why was the
             'Please and Thank You Song' cut?

<b>                     SHELDON

             of fluff without the 'Please and

             anchor! That's where the lesson

<b>                      SHELDON
</b>             I can't do that. I will not
             condone children consuming endless
             amounts of refined sugar. I have

             keeps the lights on.

<b>                     SHELDON

             for the cameras.

An angry Sheldon storms off in frustration, but then
stops. He looks back at her.

<b>                           SHELDON
</b>             We have different eyes, Nora.
             When I go out there I see kids.
             You see wallets with pigtails.

He moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He
obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the
studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring
at him from under the stairwell. After a beat,
Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's
clutching a duffle bag.

<b>INT. PROP ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door.
He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's
multicolored "magic cookie bag." He opens it and tosses
the cookies into the trash can. Reaching into his
pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. He
chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag.

<b>                  RANDOLPH
</b>          Bon soir, la Smoochy.   Welcome to
          fatty Arbuckle-land.

He cackles to himself. He then notices a box in the
corner of the room. Scribbled in magic marker on the
side are the words: "Rainbow Randolph crap." He walks
over and pulls the box out. He slowly opens the flaps.
Inside is his old costume. He pulls it out and clutches
it lovingly. He smells it. The ECHOEY SOUND of his
THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment,
along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING.

<b>                        RANDOLPH

He holds up Smoochy's magic cookie bag.   He then stuffs
his old costume into his duffle bag.


<b>INT. STUDIO B - LATER

The "Smoochy Show" is in the middle of a taping. The
Smoochyland Band is playing a fast, jazzy number ("Doin'
the Jiggy Ziggy") as Smoochy, the Rhinettes, and several
kids dance frenetically. The kids in the bleachers are
in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically. The
song finally ends. The kids in the bleachers jump to
their feet, cheering and applauding.

The lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the "2001

ceiling by a filament wire. The kids go crazy.

them.

He peers out from his hiding place backstage. His eyes
widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its
descent.

The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy. He holds the bag
high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as
the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him.

out a flaming red penis cookie. The cookie is somewhat

Angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn-down but tidy
apartment. A "Rhinette" costume is draped over one of
the chairs. There is a sudden LOUD POUNDING on the door.

on the shelf above. He pulls out a revolver. The

a crack. Peering in at him are the bloodshot eyes of
Rainbow Randolph.

          don't want you to feel intimidated
          just because the power structure
          has changed a bit. I consider you

Ben reaches into his breast pocket and drops a large wad
of money on Sheldon's desk that lands with a thud.

<b>                        SHELDON

We are now on a drum solo. Ernie the Elephant of the
Smoochyland Band works it. The animal band plays a
sloppy version of "Pop Goes the Weasel." End on Spinner
Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band.
Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating
intently on the proper moment to hit it. Unfortunately,
his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off
as well.

We WIDEN OUT to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting
to dance to the off-kilter rhythm. The song finally
ends. The Rhinettes glare at Spinner. Smoochy addresses
the camera.

the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor.

             to do an ice show, and let me add

             doing an ice show, so we have
             nothing to discuss. Now, if
             you'll just pull over, I'll get
             out and we'll say our toodley-dos.

<b>INT. CORPORATE PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A troubled-looking Sheldon stands on his balcony looking
out at the city. He drinks orange juice straight from
the carton.

Sheldon is on the phone with Burke.

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          This is unacceptable, Burke!    I'm
          calling the authorities.

<b>                  BURKE (V.O.)
</b>          Don't do it, Shel. You rat on
          Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky
          if they find your toenails. These
          guys are the roughest of all the
          charities.

<b>                   SHELDON
</b>          I was threatened by an
          organization that's supposed to
          help children! What kind of world
          is this?

<b>                   BURKE (V.O.)
</b>          The real one. My advice?
          Consider the ice show and stay
          healthy.

Burke hangs up. After a beat, Sheldon's DOORBELL RINGS.
He walks over to the door and opens it. To his surprise,
Nora is standing there.

<b>                       NORA
</b>          May I come in?

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          Sure.

Nora enters. She seems a little wobbly.    Sheldon notices
she's holding a pint of whiskey.

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          Uh... are you okay?

<b>                  NORA
</b>          I'm getting drunk and I'm not used
          to it.

<b>                  SHELDON
</b>          Oh. Well, not to make you feel
          worse, but with alcohol you're
          also consuming empty calories.

Nora looks at him for a moment.

<b>                      SHELDON

Nora trips slightly.     Sheldon takes the whiskey from her.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             Why don't we get some air?

He leads her out on the balcony.    They look out at the
city.

</b>             I... I may have been a little
             harsh when we spoke the other day.
             A little out of line.

</b>             Well, it wasn't as bad as the week
             before when you called me a pasty-
             faced, no-talent hack.

<b>                      NORA
</b>             Yes, that was probably insensitive
             as well.
                 (looks at him)
             I heard you're not doing the ice
             show. I find that... incredibly
             admirable. Why didn't you tell

             your fun. You look so content
             when you're berating me.

Nora looks down.

<b>                     NORA
</b>             I'm afraid I have become a bit
             hardened over the years.

Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky-
Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and
look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and
kisses her.

them says anything for a beat.

<b>INT. WAREHOUSE - SHELDON'S POV
</b>
Several hundred men in Nazi uniforms in a warehouse
draped in swastikas. They all start chanting:

<b>                      NAZIS
</b>             Heil Smoochy!    Heil Smoochy!   Heil
             Smoochy!

A huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing
him like Patton in front of the American flag.
Flashbulbs go off. The "Heil Smoochys" continue. A
GERMAN MARCH starts to BLARE from the SPEAKERS. Looking
stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic. He clears
his throat. The MUSIC STOPS. Everyone quiets down. He
searches for just the right words, and finally...

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             It's my sincere hope that I'm
             dreaming right now, but in the
             event that I'm not... what's the
             deal with the swastikas?

Suddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse.

<b>                     LEAD COP
</b>             This is an unlawful assembly, you
             kraut sons-a-bitches! You're all
             under arrest!

Pandemonium ensues us all the Nazis run for cover.
Sheldon stands in the middle of it all, unsure what to
do.


<b>EXT. WAREHOUSE - SHORT WHILE LATER
</b>
Sheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is
barraged with questions from waiting REPORTERS.
Flashbulbs go off as they shout out questions.

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAYS LATER

A disheveled and unshaven Sheldon wanders the streets,
looking dazed. He's stuffing a cupcake into his mouth
and swigging from a bottle of root beer. He passes a
construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall --
a crudely-drawn goose-stepping Smoochy in a Nazi uniform
and Hitler moustache. Sheldon keeps walking. He
descends the subway stairs at 42nd Street.

to perform at. It's boarded up. He just stares at it.
An OLD VAGRANT walks up to him.

A morose-looking Spinner Dunn sits alone at the end of
the bar in the nightclub. Tommy walks over.

             up. I just know it, Tommy.
             Someone's making stuff up!

Spinner starts violently pounding his head on the bar,
causing GLASSES to RATTLE.

A makeup woman dabs Sheldon's forehead as he's about to
go on. Nora stands next to him. A LOW TYMPANY ROLL is
heard from the stage.

The lights come up as the Smoochyland Band plays a
strong, dramatic version of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic." After a moment, Smoochy slowly rises from a
lift under the stage. A giant sign above the jungle
lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks. It
reads: WELCOME HOME SMOOCHY!


<b>ANGLE ON SMOOCHYLAND BAND
</b>
A beaming Spinner Dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell
to the music as tears stream down his cheeks.


<b>BACK ON SMOOCHY
</b>
He majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids
who are giving him a standing ovation. The song
crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the
Smoochyland Band who sing, "His truth is marching on!"

Thunderous applause from the bleachers. Smoochy walks
over to a stool and takes a seat. It's very quiet in the
studio now. Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically
serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down.
He's in black limbo.

<b>                     SMOOCHY

             You know, kids, sometimes life in
             the jungle can be unfair. A place
             where nice guys don't just finish
             last... they get their heads cut
             off.

Gasps from the bleachers.

The kids cheer as the Smoochyland Band launches into the
Hokey-Pokey song and Smoochy starts dancing. The kids
pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set. Everyone
is dancing and having a ball. Nora is clapping to the
music offstage. Sheldon and Nora exchange affectionate
glances.

Randolph sits in front of the TELEVISION in a daze. He's
wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese
curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap. ON the TV,
an "Entertainment Tonight"-type show with two perky hosts
is covering Smoochy's return to the airwaves. The hosts,
Tara and Hunter show Smoochy's dynamic entrance and the
standing ovation he got during the taping that day.

             glimpse of their favorite rhino.

<b>                     HUNTER (V.O.)
</b>             That's right, Tara. Smoochy's
             popularity is stronger than ever
             thanks to his recent exoneration
             as a Nazi sympathizer. In fact,
             several movie studios are offering
             big bucks for a chance to bring
             the Smoochy story to the silver
             screen...

             Sheldon, this costume's makin' my
             nuts itch.

Sheldon looks horrified. The Smoochyland Band quickly
launches into some music. Smoochy, Moochy and a few
other jungle animals begin to dance. Moochy's lumbering
movements are in stark contrast to the choreographed
steps of the others. As a bonus, he occasionally
scratches his crotch.


<b>INT. SHELDON'S DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW

A happy Spinner (still in costume as Moochy) pokes his
head into Sheldon's dressing room. Sheldon, still in
costume as well, looks drained after the difficult
taping.

</b>             That was fun! Was it bad when I
             done that thing, where I tripped
             and knocked over the Flamingo and

Spinner, humming to himself, lumbers down the hallway on
his way to the wardrobe room. Halfway down the hall, he
hears a voice call out to him.

Spinner turns around. The door to the fire exit swings
open. Two of Merv's thugs emerge and grab Spinner (who's
still in full Moochy costume) and drag him into the
stairwell.

</b>
Spinner is dragged into the garage and knocked to the
pavement. Several more thugs emerge from the shadows,
including Henry, Merv's main henchman. They start
beating him with lead pipes. Henry pulls out a REVOLVER.
He SHOOTS the rhino several times. A sedan trunk is
popped open and Moochy is thrown inside. The CAR
SCREECHES up to the street.

We CRANE DOWN FROM a Chinese banner that stretches across
two tenements. We LAND ON the seedy, deserted street

Ellis walks over. McCall shows him some scribblings he's

Inside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around

<b>FLASHBACK - INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A bloodied Merv Green is tied to a chair in the middle
of the warehouse as he begs Tommy for his life. Merv's
two henchmen lay dead nearby. Roy, Jimmy and Sammy --
Tommy's guys -- stand behind her.

<b>                  MERV

<b>INT. STOKES' OFFICE - EVENING
</b>
Nora is alone in Stokes' office, rearranging cards on
the giant cork board that displays the network schedule.
She is startled to hear a deep voice behind her.

<b>                            VOICE (O.S.)
</b>             Where is he?

She turns around. Chick, Tobi, and Sambo are standing
there. Chick walks over to the cork board. He scans a
row of cards that all read "Smoochy."

He rips a Smoochy index card from the board, walks over
to her and waves it in her face.

<b>                           CHICK

Chick looks at his boys and chuckles.

He suddenly pulls out a switchblade and holds it to
Nora's throat.

             fucking network if we have to.
             Starting with the pretty ones.

He removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward
the bulletin board. It lands -- sticking right in the
middle of a Smoochy card.

<b>                           CHICK
</b>             Auf Wiedersehen, honey.

They exit.


<b>INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Nora is pacing.    Sheldon sits by the fire.

<b>                     NORA
</b>             It's Stokes. He's behind the

             show host from Asia.

Sheldon's head is swimming. Suddenly the front door to
to the penthouse bursts open. Randolph, dressed like
he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun.

waves the gun in his face.

chair. He takes a CD, "PARTY TIME WITH RAINBOW

audio system on the fireplace wall.

Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle.
Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab
the gun. Randolph shrieks. The two men wrestle on the
floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter. He
screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace.

Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom. Nora reaches for a
fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it. Randolph
cries out and drops the gun. Sheldon grabs it and points
it at Randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a
child. He's bleeding.

<b>                     RANDOLPH

             My life's over anyway. Everything

Sheldon slowly takes the gun away from Randolph's head.

Randolph throws his arms around Sheldon and cries into
his shoulder. Sheldon pats his back. He glances down at
Randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy.

Nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from

the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow.
Randolph lets out a blood curdling scream.

The lights go down. A full orchestra begins to play the
overture to WAGNER's Tristen et Isolde. The lights come
up as a soprano -- a heavyset woman in a modified rhino
costume -- skates out through the fog and begins singing
the opera. Smoochy -- now wearing a peasant's frock --
skates an interpretive dance in the b.g. with a few
Rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants. A beautiful
fairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the
rafters and takes Smoochy's hand. She skates away with
him as he waves good-bye to the Rhinettes.

<b>CONTINUED:

A confused Sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the
Smoochy head.

Nora, who's entered at the opposite end of the rink,
tries to reach him, but it's impossible. Panicked
audience members run across the rink, heading for the
exits. It's chaos. People slip, Rhinettes get trampled.


<b>CATWALK
</b>
Randolph tries to get the rifle away from Buggy. They
struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink. The cops
have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now. Tommy
and the boys get there a second later. They all stand
back -- the catwalk is too unstable.

<b>                     RANDOLPH
</b>             Give me that gun, you fucking
             wacked-out freak!

Buggy manages to shove Randolph off him. He raises the
RIFLE and SHOOTS at the cops. Randolph grabs him. Both
he and Buggy lose their footing and slip from the
catwalk. Randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold
on. Buggy clutches Randolph's leg which threatens to
bring them both down. They dangle 80 feet above the
rink. Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the
catwalk as Buggy clings to Randolph's ankle.


<b>CLOSE ON RANDOLPH'S FINGERS
</b>
His knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from
the beam.


<b>ANGLE ON BUGGY
</b>
Still clutching Randolph's ankle, he starts to lose his
grip. He desperately grabs Randolph's foot, but
Randolph's shoe slips off and Buggy begins his long
plunge to the next life.


<b>INT. RINK - HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT
</b>
Buggy screams the whole way down, still holding onto
Randolph's shoe.


<b>RINK
</b>
Buggy crashes into the middle of the rink, cob-webbing
the ice around him.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        116.
</b>
<b>CATWALK
</b>
Tommy and his boys runs off to find Sheldon. The COPS
help Randolph off the catwalk. He's a nervous wreck.

<b>                  COP #1
</b>          You okay?

<b>                  RANDOLPH
</b>          I don't know. I'm kind of fucked
          up in general, so it's hard to
          gauge.

They pat the dazed Randolph on the back.   He passes out.


<b>RINK
</b>
People continue to run through the rink. Felled
Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls. Smoke fills
the air. Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet
as Nora finally reaches him. She embraces him.

<b>                  NORA
</b>          Burke's with Stokes.   He's been in
          it all along.

Sheldon looks toward the network box. Beyond it, through
the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people
who jam the exit trying to escape. Sheldon reaches into
his costume and pulls out his gun.

<b>                  NORA
</b>          No, Sheldon, don't!

Sheldon runs off leaving Nora.


<b>EXIT
</b>
Burke is almost through the cluster of people. He
glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading
toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally
gets through.


<b>EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment
later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke
in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in
his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy
head.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        117.
</b>
<b>FURTHER DOWN STREET
</b>
Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a
disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds
the corner.


<b>EXT. STREET
</b>
A few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks
down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an
alley by an abandoned building.


<b>EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn.
Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He
whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun
goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly
on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it
out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts
to strangle him.

<b>                        BURKE
</b>          You fucking point a gun at me? A
          gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's
          your fucking etiquette?

Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a
GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing
Sheldon's gun directly at him.

<b>                           NORA
</b>          Let him go.

Burke just looks at her.

<b>                        NORA
</b>          Now. Before I pump one in that
          Grecian Formula scalp of yours.

Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up
and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at
Burke.

<b>                  BURKE
</b>          You know something, kid? You've
          turned out to be an incredible
          pain in the ass.

Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit.

<b>                             SHELDON
</b>          You were behind the Spinner hit,
          weren't you?

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                     BURKE
</b>             That was a tragic mistake.
                    (shakes head sadly)
             If only one could turn back time...
                    (beat)
             But what the hell, it's just one
             less mick in the world.

He laughs.

<b>                           NORA
</b>             You son-of-a-bitch.

Sheldon cocks the gun.

<b>                     BURKE
</b>             Oh my. What are you gonna do?
             Kill me? That wouldn't be very
             Smoochy-like behavior.

<b>                      SHELDON
</b>             You're right. There's just one
             thing...

Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and
steps out of it.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             I'm not Smoochy.

Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>             I finally realized we're living in
             a different jungle.

Burke suddenly looks fearful, as does Nora.

<b>                             NORA
</b>             No, Sheldon.

Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the
courage to pull the trigger.

<b>                             NORA
</b>             Sheldon!

Suddenly, there's a voice from behind.

<b>                           VOICE (O.S.)
</b>             Don't do it, Shel.

Sheldon turns around.       It's Tommy and her boys.

<b>                     SHELDON
</b>                (sternly)
             Stay out of it, Tommy.   This is my
             business.

Tommy walks closer to Sheldon.

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>             No more killin', Shel. Enough's
             enough. Don't destroy who you are
             for this piece of shit. You mean
             something to the kids. Don't take
             Smoochy away from the kids.

Tommy extends her hand for the gun. Sheldon looks down
at the gun. He can't believe he's even holding it. He
hands it to Tommy.

<b>                           SHELDON
</b>             I don't know how I got pushed this
             far.

<b>                           TOMMY
</b>             You're only human, Shel. The
             important thing is... you never
             went over the cliff. You're a
             good boy. For some of us... it's
             too late.

Tommy pats Sheldon's shoulder affectionately.

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>             We'll take it from here, kid, you
             run along with your girl. Get on
             with your life.

Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified.

<b>                           SHELDON
</b>             Tommy, you're not going to --

<b>                           TOMMY
</b>             Don't worry. Sometimes even a
             rat deserves a little mercy.

Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before
walking out of the alley. Burke is wide-eyed with fear
as Tommy's boys advance on him. Just as they round the
corner there is the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS. Sheldon looks
at Nora.

<b>                             NORA
</b>             Bus backfire.

She pats him on the back.

<b>EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Stokes finally makes it out of the arena. He runs toward
his waiting limo and hops in the back seat. He barks to
his driver through the glass partition.

<b>                  STOKES
</b>          Get out of here!

The car doesn't move.   Stokes pounds on the partition.

<b>                  STOKES
</b>          Move this thing!

No response. Stokes frantically pushes the button that
lowers the partition. It slides down.

<b>                  STOKES
</b>          Are you deaf?! I said --

The driver turns around. Stokes recoils in horror. It's
Takashi. He smiles as the back doors open and the
Japanese thugs -- Chick, Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with
Stokes. They slam the doors shut.

<b>                  CHICK
</b>          I wish I could tell you it'll be
          quick and painless, Frank, but you
          know how these things go...

Stokes lets out a small whimper. Chick nods to Takashi
who steps on the gas as he sings "Anything Goes" in
Japanese.


<b>EXT. TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The car heads into the night, passing Sheldon and Nora,
who have exited the alley. This will be Frank Stokes'
final limo ride.

Sheldon and Nora pause on the street.    Sheldon looks
around him.

<b>                        SHELDON
</b>          You know, a little grime here and
          there doesn't change the fact...

He looks at Nora.

Sheldon gazes back at her.

They kiss passionately as MUSIC SWELLS and the CAMERA
CRANES HIGH ABOVE the rink.

Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause.

Randolph skates out, somewhat shakily, to huge applause.
Sheldon puts his arm around him. The audience is now on
their feet. Randolph especially basks in the adulation.
