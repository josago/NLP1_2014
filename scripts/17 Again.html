</b>          Dom serves Mike a cocky wink, continues on.    Mike scowls.

</b>          Scarlet, 36, slams a shovel into the ground, wedges it
          beneath a dying shrub and rips it out.

</b><b>                              SCARLET
</b>                    I am a landscape designer. Then
                    again you barely took an interest
                    in my work so I guess that's a fair
                    question.

</b><b>                              SCARLET

                    you needed. Maybe it's time you

                    there are so many options out there
                    for a 36 year old with only a high
                    school diploma.

</b><b>                              SCARLET
</b>                    No, but it's what you think, right?
<b>          
</b>          Mike's silence says it all.    Scarlet fights back tears.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SCARLET (CONT'D)
</b>                    I never asked you to marry me.

</b>          Scarlet shakes her head in frustration.

                    victim here.

          into a hole.

</b>                    But, People, Stan's a bully. Why?
                    It would be way too easy to say
                    Stan preys on the weak because he's
                    simply a dick. No, Stan's more
                    complex than that. According to
                    leading psychiatrists Stan is a
                    bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under
                    all that male bravado there's an
                    insecure little girl banging on the
                    closet door trying to get out. 2,
                    like a caveman, Stan's brain is
                    underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is
                    unable to use self-control so he
                    acts out aggressively. And the
                    third reason-
<b>          
</b>          Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MIKE (CONT'D)
</b>                    I'd argue that Stan suffers from
                    all 3.
<b>          
</b>          The entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY.
<b>          
</b>          Mike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then
          gently rolls the ball back to Stan.

</b>          Samantha leaps up, scurries over to Mike.      Lauren and Jamie

</b>          As Mike and Alex approach the gathering, Alex freezes up.

          Maggie sitting by the fire alone, slips out.
<b>          
</b>          ANGLE: Alex steps over to Nicole and suddenly loses
          confidence. As he turns to retreat, Nicole looks up-

</b>                    September 7th, 1988 was the first
                    time I saw you. You were reading
                    `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a
                    Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never
                    seen anything so perfect. I
                    remember thinking I had to have you
                    or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda
                    way but in that beautiful,
                    innocent, unaffected way that way
                    only a 17 year-old kid can have.
                    You whispered you loved me at the
                    homecoming dance and I felt so
                    peaceful and safe because I knew no
                    matter what happened from that
                    night on nothing could ever be that
                    bad because I had you. And then I
                    grew up, lost my way and blamed you
                    for my failures. But I was never
                    lost. I'd just forgotten the way
                    life makes you forget as you grow
                    older. And I never failed at
                    anything because on that September
                    day you said `yes' to me. And at
                    that dance you said you loved me.
                    And as I stand here...as I write
                    this, I want you to know if I don't
                    have you I'll die...not in a psycho
                    way but in that beautiful,
                    innocent, unaffected way only a 17
                    year old kid can have....oh
                    and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the
                    Wolf'.
