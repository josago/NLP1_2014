    WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits
    beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in
    North America. This is BIG Alaska.

    A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper
    left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and
    comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and
    moves around the front of the truck. We can just make
    out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a
    very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from
    the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.

<b>                           DRIVER
</b>              Hey!

    The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK,
    stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of
    the truck.

<b>                           DRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>              Come here.

    BACKPACK walks back to the truck.    As he approaches the
    driver's door, we

    CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto
    the DRIVER.

<b>                           DRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>                     (referring to items we see
                      sitting on dashboard)
              You left your watch, your comb, your
              change...

    We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks:

<b>                           BACKPACK
</b>              Keep it.

<b>                           DRIVER
</b>              I don't want your money.    And I already
              have a watch.

<b>                           BACKPACK
</b>              If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it
              away. I don't want to know what time it
              is, what day it is, or where I am.

</b>
<b>                          BACKPACK (CONT'D)
</b>             I don't want to see anybody. None of
             that matters.

The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls
out an old pair of rubber work boots.

<b>                          DRIVER
</b>                    (handing him the boots)
             Take em.

There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the
boots.

<b>                          DRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>             If you make it out alive, give me a call,
             and I'll tell you how to get the boots
             back to me.

We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken
the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the
driver.

<b>                          BACKPACK
</b>             Hey, do me a favor, will ya?     Take a
             picture of me.

Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts
walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he
maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE
until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing.

CLICK.   He snaps the shot.
Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.          Driver
hands him the camera.

</b>             You gonna be alright?

<b>                          BACKPACK
</b>             I'll be better than that.
                    (I'll be who I am.)

As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the
concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the
comb, and the watch on the dash.

    We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form
    of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the

    turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the

</b>    May 1990

    The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students.
    Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn.

    INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just
    feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace.

    One by one the names of graduates announced. Their
    bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to
    the podium to accept their diplomas.

    INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head.
    Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE
    MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark
    striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and
    CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist
    length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck.
    They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in
    sight.

    INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO
    CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.

    From the announcement podium comes the name of their son
    and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The
    McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris'
    absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap
    and gown.

Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium
platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS
leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound,
frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine
"That's our Chris." And just as quickly as Chris has
been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform
steps.

SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a
frame of blue sky. We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image
as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the
sky to focus on his parents.

(HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie
delight upon the caps.) An outer glee in sharp contrast
to voice over:

          under the ochre sandstone arch, the
          red tiles glinting like bent
          plates of blood behind his head,
          I see my mother with a few light books at
          her hip
          standing at the pillar made of tiny
          bricks with the
          wrought-iron gate still open behind her,
          its
          sword-tips black in the May air,

          about to get married,
          they are kids, they are dumb, all they
          know is they are
          innocent, they would never hurt anybody.
          I want to go up to them and say Stop,
          don't do it--she's the wrong woman,
          he's the wrong man, you are going to do
          things
          you cannot imagine you would ever do,
          you are going to do bad things to
          children,
          you are going to suffer in ways you never
          heard of,
          you are going to want to die. I want to
          go
          up to them there in the late May sunlight
          and say it,

    old yellow Datsun with Carine in the passenger seat
    beside him, and pulls up to the space beside the
    Cadillac.

    In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster
    on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from "The
    Good, The Bad, And The Ugly."

    We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor -
    Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak.
    Beside them, a camper's backpack.

    Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight.
    The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But
    on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank
    envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes
    a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the
    same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all
    my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris
    McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a
    pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston)
    envelope.

    He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the
    cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each,

     The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just

     The Datsun, a yellow speck in the frame. Coyotes yap at

     In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil
     upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting
     sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed.
     We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled

     Chris McCandless, in the same clothes he had been in back
     in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the
     Datsun. His head supported by his backpack. We begin to
     HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It
     rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to
     a deafening level. Chris awakens.

     As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through
     the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the
     leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of
     water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun,
     momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is
     SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright,
     disoriented.

     POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight,
     water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.

     However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe
     him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water,
     while violent seems to have topped off just above the
     wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the
     car settles into its new position below the cliff. He
     returns to sleep.

     What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile
     beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor.

     We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA

     through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint
     maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground.

     WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile
     behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack.
     He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's
     stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as
     much wilderness before us as we did behind.

A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris. A YOUNG BLACK

play. Chris begins to serenade the monster,
intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera
as well. He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is

<b>                       CARINE (V.O.)
</b>          When we were little, Chris was very to
          himself. He wasn't anti-social, he
          always had friends, and everybody liked
          him - but he could go off and entertain
          himself for hours, he didn't seem to need
          toys or friends. He could be alone
          without being lonely. The secrets our
          parents kept, though unknown to Chris and
          I, led to bouts of rage and even violence
          between them that we had been forced to
          witness since we were very young. It
          seemed like they never fought without us.
          I remember the first family meeting to
          let Chris and me in on their plans for
          getting a divorce. They wanted us to
          choose which of them we'd live with. I
          cried my eyes out. But the divorce never
          happened, though the threats and meetings
          never stopped. It wasn't long before
          Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom
          and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
          Chris and I just wanted to get away from
          their fights and mom kept promising to
          get out and take us with her as soon as
          their company made enough money. Dad had
          been the young genius [that] NASA
          enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the
          American satellite radar systems that
          would be our answer to the Russian
          Sputnik. And mom and he later started up
          a consulting firm combining her get-up-
          and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of
          knowledge. By the time the company
          actually made its first million, the
          careerism and money seemed to erase her
          memory of the promise she'd made us.

<b>                            CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>               I think this is when Chris began to see
               "careers" as a diseased invention of the
               twentieth century and to resent money and
               the useless priority people made of it in
               their lives. He'd begun planning to
               "slay the beast"...to make himself free.

     His grip on the knife tightens.

addressing Chris.

lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat.
He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a
police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris.

     With his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his
     goofy new hat onto his head, we find Chris at a "dead
     run" to catch a ride that had overshot him. (Director's
     note: Don't leave this image too soon.) An old van idles
     waiting for him. As he gets to the passenger side, the
     woman passenger gets out. This is JAN BURRES, early
     40's, looks to be still on the long road home from
     Woodstock. A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot
     of premature grey in it.

     Jan moving to the side door.

               that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't
               back up - the van's reverse is broken.

     looking at the rearview mirror too, observing Chris with

     Chris, Jan, and Rainey are beside a campfire, sitting on
     blankets. Their tents loom behind them.

     Jan is weaving some sort of craft art. Chris is chomping
     on chicken and beans like they're going out of style.

               car too. I'd driven it cross country the
               first time when I got out of high school.
               I had some really great adventures with

     Chris sits up reading, his tent entry flap ajar to let
     the small candle lantern ventilate.

     OS we HEAR a ZIPPING SOUND. It's Rainey. We see him
     from Chris' POV coming out of his tent deep in thought.

     As he moves to the glowing embers of what remains of the
     campfire, Rainey's face goes out of frame and all Chris
     can see are his booted feet, tapping bits of glowing wood
     into the center of the fire. The tapping is slow and
     thoughtful. Micro-embers float upward into the night.

     Chris' tent flap closes by his own hand.

     ANGLE: Chris' dog-ears his book and puts out the lantern.

     We see Chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above
     the beach. He's got it tied to his back and his front.
     If we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging
     himself.

     Chris' POV: The rocks beside the water's edge. We see
     Rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea. We
     follow Chris' gaze to Jan, some fifty yards down the
     beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction
     of Rainey.
     ANGLE: Rainey at the water's edge.   Chris appears beside
     him.

But Rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.

</b>          Well, my friend, all is not well on the

binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside
Rainey.

<b>                       RAINEY (CONT'D)
</b>          You're an industrious little fucker,

          going through this thing real quietly
          cause, well...So, after running into you
          last night, this thing we were going
          through quietly, she started talking
          about. You know what I mean?

Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          I think she's probably quietly
          disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to
          her to be close to you if there's a hole
          of some kind somewhere else.

<b>                       RAINEY
</b>          That's a helluva insight. Jesus!...
          You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna
          walk on that water and get her back for

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.

Rainey gives him a sideways glance.

<b>                       CHRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          It's true. But it's something I've got
          to get over sometime.

</b>               I'll carry.   Shit-yes I'll carry.

     And with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan.
     Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they
     strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean,
     splashing and laughing.

     ANGLE: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his old
     lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and
     heads to the campsite.

     ANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having
     a ball.

     Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness
     and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the
     stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends
     below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and
     laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of
     her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re-
     surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face.

     WALDEN from the chapter on "Higher Laws" as we move
     slowly in toward him, we begin to HEAR quiet sounds of
     what may be love-making coming from Rainey and Jan's

     Jan appears from her tent, rubbing her eyes. She wears a

</b>               In early September, mom and dad got a
               call from the Annandale police notifying
               them that Chris' abandoned car had been
               identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol
               after a group of rare flower hunters
               stumbled upon it in the desert. There
               were no signs that Chris had intended to
               return to it. But there wasn't any
               evidence of struggle. The police said
               they thought Chris had chosen to leave it
               behind and not that it had been taken
               from him. Nonetheless, the initial
               comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly
               turned to their realization that Chris
               was actually trying not to be found.

               that appreciation.

     Chris holds the large gift toward Walt. Walt moves
     through his friends to Chris and strips the paper,
     exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope.

     Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.   And the
     party responds with applause.

     Chris walks through the cheering family friends to take
     his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps.

                his trip and ended up staying away most
                of the summer. It was nearly three months
                before he walked back into our house in
                Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his
                hair was long and tangled, and he was
                rail thin. As soon as I heard he was
                home, I ran into his room to talk to him.
                In California, he'd looked up some old
                family friends who still lived there.
                He'd found out that long after he had
                been born, our dad had continued a
                relationship with his first wife Marcia
                in secret.

                That two years after Chris was born, dad
                had had another son with Marcia. Worse
                yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was
                still legally married at the time. And
                it was Chris and I who were the bastard
                children.

               rigorous moral code. He loathed what he
               considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and
               resented what they considered guidance.
               Chris submitted to dad's authority
               through college but I knew he raged
               inwardly the whole time. It was
               inevitable that Chris would rebel. And

          licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in
          Carthage and another one a few miles out
          of town. But in the summertime I run a
          combine crew, follow the harvest from
          Texas way the hell north to the Canadian
          border. We just got done cutting barley
          for Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I
          got this little black box deal on the
          side (You know what I mean?)

          You said it, not me.

Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.

Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated
food. As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind
rocks the trailer.

     Just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding
     the trailer shell. A couple hits of lightning follow.

     Chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag
     between a Hudderite and the sleeping KEVIN. Wayne comes

     Chris waves a thanks, puts the pillow beneath his head
     and closes his eyes.

     As Chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the
     grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos.

     WIDE SHOT: Chris and Wayne sit atop a combine. In the
     background we see Wayne's trailer and two other combines
     piloted by Wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe
     blond grain.

     Chris tries his hand at the shifter once more.   This time
     the thing starts to move.

     pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter.

Chris' POV: from high in the grain elevator. He watches
Wayne below, as Wayne saunters out to the field to take a
piss. With his back to us, Wayne whips it out and starts
pissing about 25 yards from the grain elevator.

CU Wayne. He looks up from his urination, the grain
elevator behind him. We see a slight mischievous smile
come to his face. He puts his hands up into the air when
suddenly -

Six unmarked FBI vehicles surround him.
(Director's note: Triangulate three long lenses on Wayne

     Chris stands beside a dramatic section of rapids.    The

     As we SLOWLY ZOOM INTO Chris' face, terrified and

     legs, when Peter Gabriel's I Have The Touch begins to

     Fear becomes determination
     We SMASH CUT ON CUE with Peter Gabriel's vocals. SLO MO,
     SUPER DRAMATIC - Chris blasting out of a shoot in the
     rapids in the kayak we saw the night before. It's
     outrageous. Hair-raising. Just like Peter Gabriel sings
     it, he has the touch.

     This kid's never kayaked before, certainly never on
     rapids. But it's that immortal stage of life, no care,
     no helmet, no life-jacket, pure adrenaline. He can
     hardly believe he's surviving it as he goes but there's
     no looking back now. And with every thump of the music,
     we share his rush. His pure unadulterated exhilaration.

     With the culmination of the music, Chris has successfully
     shot the rapid. He paddles through quiet waters.

     He feels immortal. He makes his about-face and is about
     to head down stream when he sees at the river's edge, a
     group of RIVER TOURISTS and their GUIDE lunching beside a
     pontoon raft. The tourists look like a bunch of
     bewildered tubby-troopers in their misfitted orange life-
     vests and cereal bowl helmets. The RIVER GUIDE yells out
     at Chris as Chris moves PAST CAMERA and away. The guide
     gets on his satellite phone to alert the Rangers. We

Chris gives Sonja a little wave. She bypasses it, wading
up to the Kayak, giving him a big hug.

</b>          Hello Alex.

This couple is extremely energetic. Can't wait to
please. And a bona fide American adventurer in their
midst. It's everything they could've wanted.

Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi.

Sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry T-shirt. But
as she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keep
saying Hello.

Chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off his
face in the presence of these warm, open people.

     Chris, back in the kayak is paddling down river. Mads
     and Sonja on the bank, wave a boisterous goodbye. And
     they just keep waving. And Chris keeps waving until he
     has drifted out of sight, when around the upriver bend
     arrive the RIVER PATROL.

     At river's edge, Mads, thinking quickly, waves for their
     attention. Pointing the river patrol back upriver, he
     yells:

               about his car being found. I woke up a

     Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in
     his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak. This lower
     stretch of the river has little in common with the
     unbridled torrent that explodes through the Grand Canyon.
     Emasculated by dams and diversion canals, the lower
     Colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir,
     through some of the hottest, starkest, most austere
     country on the continent.

      SLIGHTLY, we see that there is a bend in the water's edge
      and that he is in fact, paddling in the crystalline blue
      of the Gulf.

<b>116   EXT. TRAIN YARD, SOMEWHERE NEAR ALGODONES - NIGHT         116
</b>
      A freight train cranks up its great engines and starts
      its move west.

      Chris POV: We see a BULL (hobo slang for a railway
      security guard) making his rounds. As the bull
      disappears around the caboose, and the trains motion
      picks up, Chris appears from behind a fuel pump. He
      makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight
      cars, not quite sure how to board them. He begins to
      slowly jog beside the train. There is a vertical steel
      rod on each passing car. He times the train by putting
      his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it.

And with that he accelerates to a run, throws his pack
into the moving freight car before him, simultaneously
leaping up to grab the rail and throw himself into the
car.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              72.
</b>


      But his left foot misses and he's suddenly dangling from
      the moving train. He grabs hand over hand on the rail.

      ANGLE: Dangling feet and razor sharp wheels.

      ANGLE: Chris. He puts everything into pulling himself
      up, growling the strength into his muscles finally...

                       (quietly)
                I'm a for real hobo.

      He's very happy about this (despite the near surrender of
      it.) Chris uses his pack as a pillow, lays back on it and
      begins to sing Roger Miller's King of the Road.

      campsite)

      He digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his
      pack. Last to come out of the ground, Chris' copy of
      Jack London's Call of the Wild. He pulls off a temp
      wrapping and dusts it off.

</b>                In the nine months since Chris'
                disappearance, my parents went through
                enormous changes. Guilt was giving way
                to pain. And pain seemed to bring them
                closer. My father had humbled
                dramatically. And what had always been a
                sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man
                who actually thought he could cancel
                Christmas, had given way to the
                vulnerability of a father's heart. Even
                their faces had changed. It made me sad
                that I couldn't share with Chris the new
                closeness I felt toward our parents.

      The image of Chris reading begins a SLOW DISSOLVE INTO...

                myself in doubt and remember that these

                work out that way. He left. History.
                Now ancient history. And that was the
                end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself
                - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And
                that was really good for a while. But

                becoming a man in his own way. And then,
                I don't know. He kinda followed in his
                father's footsteps - out the door and
                gone. And I really don't know where he

      We see a couple of day-glo vans and rusted out
      Studebakers that hadn't been turned over since Eisenhower
      was in the White House. Several of those living there
      mill about buck naked. And at the center of the camp,

Ron follows Chris to the rockface we'd seen Chris running
earlier. They begin to walk up it. It's tough on the

timer, at least for the moment...

getting steeper and higher. Ron stops.

<b>                       RON
</b>          I spent most of my life in the army. On
          New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over
          in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in
          the States, just driving down the road
          when a fellow who'd had too much to drink
          plowed right into them. Killed them
          both. Anyway, you might think that the
          last thing in the world I'd do, is go to
          the whiskey, but at the time, it felt
          like the only thing I could do. And I
          did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured
          I wasn't doing my wife and son any good,
          mourning them with a bottle. So, I
          pulled myself together and quit drinking,
          cold turkey. And then...

Ron, spinning his body around, points to the photographs
over the sink.

      As Ron begins to pull over.

<b>                             RON
</b>                Well my friend.

<b>                             CHRIS

      Both of them are uncomfortable. Chris goes for the door
      handle. Ron's gnarled hand reaches out to take Chris'
      elbow.
      After a long beat, Ron speaks without looking at Chris.
<b>                             RON
</b>                I had an idea. You know my mother was an
                only child. So was my father. And I was
                their only child. Now, with my own boy
                gone, I'm the end of the line. When I'm
                gone, my family will be finished. What
                do you say, you let me adopt you. I
                could be, say, your grandfather.

      This takes Chris by surprise.   He knew it would be hard
      but not this hard.

<b>                             CHRIS

      What we SEE of Carine plays with the VOICE OVER TRACK and
      SILENT with the production track; in essence lip synching
      herself.

</b>
      Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees
      something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the
      underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on
      into the clearing, where before him:

      A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International
      Harvester from the 1940's.

      Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit
      seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the
      vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing
      altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized.

      Broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. Chris may well

      He runs up a berm to look down into the river.

      He runs from corner to corner of this "Magic Bus" area
      like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee.

      He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in
      the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the
      snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs
      a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into

      is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it: A
      building rumble.

      As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika
      at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing
      the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt
      from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque
      glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had
      been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume
      and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide
      one.

      Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one
      slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM!
      the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch
      he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like
      lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below,
      saving himself from a certain death.

      drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting
      position beside it.

      rain, a bright red berry moves in the breeze like a tiny
      vibrating bell. RACK FOCUS to Chris' eyes spying it. He
      plucks it from its stem.

      Chris looking very thin. Too thin. He is noshing on a
      bag of collected berries while reading from Boris
      Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago.

      ANGLE: The book

<b>                             CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
</b>                Here she stopped and, closing her eyes,
                took a deep breath of the flower-scented
                air of the broad expanse around her. It
                was dearer to her than her kin, better
                than a lover, wiser than a book.

      ANGLE: Chris pulls more berries from the bag and chews on
      them as he reads.

                By its right name. By its right name.

      He puts down the book and brings one of the ripe berries
      in front of his face (as close as shot of when he picked
      it.)

      Chris then grabs Tanaina Plantlore, the flora and fauna
      book he had gotten from the library in Fairbanks. And it
      takes him out of the bus like a divining rod. His nose
      in the book, he follows it.

      With Tanaina Plantlore by his side, Chris digs into the
      soft earth on the berm of the river bank and digs up a
      wild potato root.

      Chris pulls the seeds from the root, noshing on them as
      he reads from Doctor Zhivago.

      We drift from him reading to the diary/log on the wall.

      The day representing: July 24th

      We drift back to Chris. Fatigue shows in his eyes as he
      puts the book down and lays down to sleep.

      WIDE SHOT of the bus. It's a beautiful July morning.
      Birds chirp in the trees. A soft breeze sweeping down
      from the mountains massages the valley below.

      We SLOWLY ZOOM into the bus.

      The open bag of seeds beside Chris' sleeping body. We
      drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin
      parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to
      sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to
      his feet.

      Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the
      hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps.
      From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus
      and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his
      mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He
      drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest.

</b>


      We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside
      his haunted eyes. And a curiosity seems to overtake him.
      He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore, flipping
      the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph
      identifying the wild potato root and the word "edible"
      beside it. He reads the page to its conclusion and as
      almost an afterthought, turns the page to see if there
      might be more.

      The word -
<b>      POISON
</b>
      jumps off the page at him.

      The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato
      root and warns that those with:
      lateral veins, such as those invisible on the leaflets of
      wild sweet peas are poisonous.

      The words -
      ...leading to partial motor paralysis...

      ...inhibition of digestion...

      ...nausea, starvation...
<b>      ECU:   ...STARVATION

      CRASH ZOOM into Chris' face, realizing his desperate
      plight.

      squirrel Chris had clipped in the tail earlier in the
      day. On the last legs of bleeding to death, it falls
      from the tree.
      The moon becomes the sun and we pass a couple of days
      through visions of the nature about in varying light.

      Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full.
      He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening.
      He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs.
      It's all he can do just to breath.

      WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the

       Now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near

       slight silhouette.

<b>       A SUBTLE DRUM (HEART)BEAT BEGINS OVER:
</b>
       Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. He
       shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then
       considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. But taking
       his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an
       option for him. "No, no, no, don't do this to me." The
       frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream
       out.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       141.
</b>


He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakes
it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for
distraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses his
eyes on the page -

ANGLE: The page: what he reads:

<b>                       CHRIS (V.0)(O.C.)
</b>          And that an unshared happiness is not
          happiness...

Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the
book, scribbling across the page:

<b>                       CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
</b><b>                       (CONT'D)
</b><b>          HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED.
</b>
He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had
written the quote:

<b>                       CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.)
</b><b>                       (CONT'D)
</b><b>          CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME.
</b>
He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the
pencil across its blank side, writing these words
quickly, as if in panic:

<b>I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD.    GOODBYE AND
</b><b>MAY GOD BLESS ALL!
</b>
And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris
repeating:
<b>                       CHRIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)
</b>                 (with a weak voice)
          Call everything by its right name.

The drumbeat increases as he signs the note:

<b>CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.
</b>
We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he
has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his
weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays
them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes
dance wildly.

The drumming intensifies.

Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is
covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud.

      His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at
      the blue sleeping bag made by his mother.

      With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces
      his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the
      sleeping bag.

      SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun.

      Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
      We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face.

Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH.

His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in
his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true,
deep serenity.

The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease
into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom.

That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly
into our camera.

                                        And he died alive.
He made it.   He lived.   He loved.

Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER:

As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window
and up into the sky -

We drift further and further away, above the stunted
trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny
white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and
smaller.

REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in
scene #1.

Then it's him:

The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene
from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and
it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the
edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen,
we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these
words appear superimposed over it:
Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless
February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992

As those words dissolve, these words appear:
On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her
brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard.
She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.
