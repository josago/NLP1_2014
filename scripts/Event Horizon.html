               A vast field of stars. The gas giant Neptune slowly spins 
               into view. Brilliant and blue and cold against the void.

               to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No 
               longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: 
               a vast labyrinth of steel.

               Its shadow swallows all in darkness.

               Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows, 
               illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment: 
               shards of metal and glass.

               MOVE from the Corridor into:

<b>               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
</b>
               A cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber, 
               reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz 
               windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark 
               but for one blinking red light.

               An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on.

               The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the 
               helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in 
               the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and 
               his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR. WILLIAM WEIR.

               Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his 
               ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.

               He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. 
               Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count 
               photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful 
               woman.

               Weir reaches to the stand. Picks up...

               The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave 
               smile.

               Weir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to 
               his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her, 
               just one more time.

               Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a 
               straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind 
               him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP...

               Weir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the 
               mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls... 
<b>               DRIP.

               Weir turns back to his shaving.

               Weir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as 
               it cooks his breakfast.

               Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal 
               mechanically, forcing himself to swallow. He reaches out to 
               open the blinds...

               Weir's window is just one of many in a space station, a 
               delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels. 
               The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit.

               A military office, United States Aerospace Command seal 
               blazoned on the door. Views of the Earth. Admiral HOLLIS 
               sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man.

               Weir enters, escorted by Hollis' adjutant, LYLE.

                         up that requires your immediate 
                         attention. Lyle?

<b>               INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
</b>
               Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. A 
               box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing 
               red dot in its orbit.

                         TDRSS picked up an automated 
                         navigation beacon broadcasting at 
                         two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.

               Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data. Weir reads the 
               data with growing excitement.

                         It's the Event Horizon. She's come 
                         back.

               Hollis answers drily.

</b>                         That ship was lost in deep space, 
                         seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed 
                         into New York harbor, I'd find it 
                         more plausible.
                              (beat)
                         Houston wants Aerospace to send out 
                         a search and rescue team, investigate 
                         the source of the transmission. If 
                         it really is the Event Horizon, 
                         they'll attempt a salvage.

                         We need you to prepare a detailed 
                         briefing on the ship's systems for 
                         the salvage crew...

                         anticipate the variables on a mission 
                         like this. I have to go with them.

               Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request.

<b>                                     LYLE
</b>                         Dr. Weir, you have no experience 
                         with salvage procedures.

</b>                         I designed the ship's propulsion 
                         system. I am the only person capable 
                         of evaluating the performance of the 
                         gravity drive. You can't send a Search 
                         and Rescue team out there alone and 
                         expect them to succeed. That would 
                         be like... like sending an auto-
                         mechanic to work on the shuttle.

                         your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it 
                         doesn't factor into this.

                              (beat, passionate)
                         The Event Horizon was created for 
                         one reason: to go faster than light. 
                         Imagine mankind exploring new solar 
                         systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven 
                         years ago, we didn't just lose the 
                         ship and the crew. We lost the dream.

                         vessel. This was the only response.

               Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips 
               from office speakers: STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES. 
               Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together, 
               they are unbearable.

               The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC. Lyle stops the tape.

               Weir sits there, stunned.

               The darkness of the Core ripples...

               Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure 
               riding a wave of impenetrable blackness.

               Cooper catches him, holds him tight as the wave carries them 
               towards the wall. Cooper sees a control rod -- a long metal 
               spike -- coming at them. He twists his body so that they 
               miss -- barely -- before slamming into the wall.

               ...the Event Horizon in all its horrific glory, hanging skew

               The Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as

               It's Smith, EVA in full protective gear. His magnetic boots 
               hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull. He kneels over a 
               hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn. Vapor 
               still leaks from the hole into space.

               Smith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole. The gel freezes

               the room. The crew (Justin and Smith excepted) tries to relax 
               on the chairs of dead men. Their faces are wan and haggard.

               Miller slogs through the coolant to the Core. Stares at it. 
               It remains metallic, mundane.

               He pulls out a Geiger counter and crosses to the reactor 
               shell. Examines a gleaming weld. The Geiger counter CLICKS 
               slowly: no leak.

               He uses a screwdriver to open up the module. Reveals a series 
               of circuit boards. One SPARKS. Weir plucks the damaged chips 
               and starts running a by-pass.

               His flashlight flickers. He bangs it against the duct wall.

               Weir starts at the sound. He recognizes the voice.

               She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in

               from the reactor. He stares...

               ...at the BURNING MAN, standing before the Core. The deep 
               ROAR of its conflagration fills the containment.

               It slowly turns and raises its arm and points at Miller in 
               accusation.

               On the threshold of hearing, a distant POUNDING. Not a 
               heartbeat. Metal on metal. Something trying to get out. 
               Something trying to get in.

               And the pounding grows louder... LOUDER... almost to

               door.

               The POUNDING grows louder. LOUDER. The door vibrates with 
               each blow Starck puts her hands over her ears. Peters SCREAMS 
               at the door.

               Starck grabs him. He tries to shake her off, but she traps 
               his arm in a wrist-lock. He turns on her, his face furious...

               ...and the POUNDING stops. They remain frozen for a moment. 
               Afraid to breathe.

               could be with her, there in the dark.

               A child's WHISPER, too faint for words. Peters turns...

               Behind her, FOREGROUND, a YOUNG CHILD dashes across the

               Peters turns back. Too late to see. Again, the child's WHISPER

               He rushes to Peters. Reaches out to touch her but pulls his

               must reach for her.

               He does, putting his hands on her hips. He slides from his

               Miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens 
               the cords. She BREATHES in ragged gasps, opens his eyes...

               Then stops. She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer

               Weir spins and FIRES at Cooper. The nail lodges in the thick 
               quartz glass. A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, 
               the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.

               Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire 
               again.

               A monitor tears free, SMASHES into him. HE IS SUCKED OUT.

               resist the winds that try to suck her into the void.

               be safe. And she will be dead.

               Miller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it 
               in the door to keep it open. He keeps one hand on the door, 
               reaches the other hand to Starck.

               She does. Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. Their 
               veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. He YELLS 
               with exertion...

               Miller runs down the corridor. Stops at a bulkhead coupling. 
               Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge, 
               switch it to MANUAL detonation.

               Cooper exits down a ladder. Starck turns to the console,

               fill with blue gel...

               ...and one begins to fill with blood... the hint of dark 
               shapes moving within...

               Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console.

               THUMP. THUMP. Starck turns. Sees the bloody tank. Sees 
               something moving inside it.

               Miller dashes for the Second Seal as IT BEGINS TO CLOSE. The

               cools as the fire subsides.

               Miller gets to his feet. Almost allows himself to relax.

               He SMASHES Miller with a backhand that ignites Miller's 
               clothes and sends him flying. The detonator falls from 
               Miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant. Miller 
               comes up CHOKING and SPLUTTERING.

               The Burning Man stalks towards Miller. The coolant STEAMS 
               and SIZZLES at his feet.

               Miller stares at the Burning Man as he approaches. Slowly 
               rises to his feet.

               The Burning Man's flames wane, revealing Weir's misshapen

               Miller against a cooling tank with BONE CRACKING force. Miller

               Weir's grotesque face is inches from his. He reaches down 
               and pulls Miller from the dripping ooze...

               ...as Miller clears the surface, he holds something in his 
               fist.

               Miller stares dead-on into Weir's hellish face...

               ...and raises his right hand. HE'S HOLDING THE DETONATOR.

               A small, silent EXPLOSION blossoms in the aft section of the

               Waves of distortion ripple over the Event Horizon's 
               containment section...

               A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as 
               the gateway opens... A BLACK HOLE...

               The black hole begins to shrink, imploding. As it collapses, 
               it sucks Neptune's blue clouds with it, creating a TITANIC 
               WHIRLPOOL with the black hole at its center...

               The SHRIEKING winds carry the foredecks back towards the 
               whirlpool, towards the black hole...

               The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion...

               The black hole collapses utterly, vanishing to a point. An 
               enormous SHOCKWAVE rips out from the point of implosion.

               The foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out 
               of Neptune's atmosphere to safety...
