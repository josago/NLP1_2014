<b>   FROM ANDREW'S FIRST CAMERA.
</b>
   CUT - to indicate time lapses within a scene


<b>   INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
</b>
   The room is dingy. Unkempt. The camera sits on the bed, on
   its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around
   off screen.

   The door handle clicks; someone's trying it.    Then nothing.
   Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.

   Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.   He speaks
   with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          What do you want, I'm getting ready
          for school-

<b>                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
</b>          Why is the door locked, unlock this
          fucking door right now.

   The bed stirs as Andrew sits down.

<b>                    MR. DETMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          I said unlock this door. UNLOCK
<b>          THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR, NOW.
</b>
<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          You're drunk-

<b>                     MR. DETMER (O.S.)
</b>          Listen, you don't tell me- IF I'M
<b>          DRUNK, OR-
</b>
<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          It's seven thirty. In the AM.
          You're drunk, dad, that's crazy-

<b>                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
</b>          What're you doing in there.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          I'm filming this.

<b>                    MR. DETMER (O.S.)
</b>          What?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          I bought a camera. I'm filming all
          your shit from now on.
<b>                                                         2.
</b>

   There's a beat, and then we can hear Mr. Detmer moving away
   from the door.


<b>   INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM
</b>
   Equally dingy. SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in
   bed. Andrew's filming her. She's clearly very ill, speaking
   in a weak rasp. Andrew now holds the camera.

<b>                   ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Mom? Will you say hi to the
          camera?

<b>                    SANDRA DETMER
</b>          Who's the audience?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          The millions of people watching at
          home.

<b>                    SANDRA DETMER
</b>          Hello world. Do I look awful?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          No, you look great.

<b>                    SANDRA DETMER
</b>          I've been looking a little better,
          yeah?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Oh yeah, definitely.

<b>                    SANDRA DETMER
</b>          It's a nice camera.

<b>   EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING
</b>
   Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the
   street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon. Andrew
   carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into
   the passenger side of a car.

   In the driver's seat is MATT Garrety, 17, with messy hair.
   He's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the
   reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school
   intellectual.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          I got you egg salad.
<b>                                                    3.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Oh, yeah, thanks.

<b>                                                 CUT.

  They're driving.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          So...Should I ask about the camera,
          or-

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          I'm filming things now. I'm
          filming everything.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          You're filming everything.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          For my mom. I'm trying to get
          custody of her from my dad. She's
          getting worse, and he's
          not...helping, and this way, in
          case something goes down-

<b>                    MATT
</b>          He gets violent or whatever-

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Right, it'd be evidence.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          Evidence. But you're not with him
          right now, but you're filming this.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Well, yeah, to add context.

<b>                     MATT
</b>          Context.   Andrew, you are...a weird
          dude.

<b>                                                 CUT.
</b>
<b>                    MATT (CONT'D)
</b>          Did you ever read any Auguste
          Comte?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          What is that?

<b>                    MATT
</b>          He's this philosopher I'm reading.
<b>                                                            4.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          For school?

<b>                    MATT
</b>          He's just like- his whole thing is
          about being positive and like,
          taking up for yourself. You should
          read him, maybe, it might make you
          feel- you know, improve your
          outlook.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Yeah, right.


<b>EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - PARKING LOT
</b>
Andrew's getting out of the car, but then ducks back in to
see Matt lighting a pipe.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Are you not coming in?

<b>                    MATT
</b>          I'm gonna blaze a little first,
          yeah?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          You're going to miss first period-

Matt turns on the radio, loud.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, okay.

<b>INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY
</b>
Andrew's filming himself putting stuff in his locker, and
does a quick sweep of the crowded school hallway.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          This is my school, I guess.   This
          is the hallway-

<b>                    GIRL
</b>          Vote "Kaz!"

A girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer.

<b>                    GIRL (CONT'D)
</b>          Vote Steve Kazinsky for Senior
          class president!
<b>                                                            5.
</b>

<b>                     ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          ...yeah-

<b>                    GIRL
</b>          Every vote counts.

Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and
featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before
something yanks the camera away.

For the first time we see ANDREW Detmer, 17, pale, awkward
and gangly, with long, stringy hair and thin, scraggly beard.
He looks anxious, if not afraid.

<b>                    BRYCE (O.S.)
</b>          Yo this camera is a piece of shit.
          It's like from 2004 or some shit.

WAYNE, 17, big and hateable in his Ed Hardy T-shirt, appears
wrapping his arm roughly around Andrew.

<b>                    WAYNE
</b>          Hey, how do I look?
              (starts muscle posing)
          Like this? Ooh, that's good.   Like
          this? That's sexy, right?

<b>                    ANDREW
</b>          Bryce, gimme my camera back-

<b>                    BRYCE (O.S.)
</b>          Fuck you Andrew, shut up.   This
          camera's a piece of shit.

<b>                    WAYNE
</b>          You got me, let's go.
Wayne turns and knocks everything out of Andrew's locker.
Bryce starts to walk away with the camera.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-

The camera is set down on the ground, and then abruptly
kicked back to Andrew. He picks it up, checking on it.

<b>                    ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>              (quietly, sad)
          Oh come on...
<b>                                                            6.

<b>EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD
</b>
A view from the bleachers as the soccer team practices. The
cheerleaders are practicing too. We cut: a different view,
lower.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          This is where I eat lunch, out here
          on the bleachers.

<b>                                                CUT.   LATER.
</b>
The camera's next to Andrew as he's eating, down on the
bench. A CHEERLEADER approaches.

<b>                     CHEERLEADER
</b>          Hi.

<b>                     ANDREW
</b>          Hey-

<b>                    CHEERLEADER
</b>          Could you not videotape us, please?
          It's really fucking creepy.

<b>                    ANDREW
</b>          I wasn't, videotaping you, so much
          as I was just-

<b>         CHEERLEADER                           ANDREW
</b>Just don't videotape-              -you know, filming what I do
                                   during the-

<b>                    CHEERLEADER
</b>          Don't videotape us, okay, or we'll
          call security. We see you watching
          us, we're not stupid, and it's
          sketchy, so back off.

<b>                     ANDREW
</b>          ...okay.

<b>                    CHEERLEADER
</b>          Is it on right now?

<b>                     ANDREW
</b>          Yes.

<b>                    CHEERLEADER
</b>          Turn it off.

Andrew turns off the camera.
<b>                                                          7.

<b>INT. MATT'S CAR
</b>
Matt's driving.   Andrew's filming from the passenger seat.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          There's a party tonight.    A barn
          party at Haven Hills.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          I thought Haven Hills was closed.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          It's abandoned, yeah. That's why
          it's a good place for a party. Two
          kegs.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Why are you telling me?

<b>                    MATT
</b>          You wanna go? I don't wanna go
          alone.

<b>                      ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          ...Nah...

<b>                    MATT
</b>          When was the last time you went to
          a party?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          I don't like parties.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          You're a senior.     Just come, you'll
          have fun.
<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          I'll think about it.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          Okay, right. Andrew, can I give
          you like, a pro tip?

<b>                      ANDREW
</b>          Yeah?

<b>                    MATT
</b>          Keep the camera at home.    It's
          weird.

<b>                    ANDREW
</b>          It has a purpose-
<b>                                                           8.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          I'm trying to be a good cousin,
          here. This is me being your
          friend, yeah? Okay?


<b>EXT. DETMER RESIDENCE
</b>
Andrew is filming as he walks along towards his house.

<b>                    HOWARD (O.S.)
</b>          Hey, what you doing?

<b>                    COSTLY (O.S.)
</b>          Hey nice camera bitch, gimme your
          fuckin camera!

The camera pans up to reveal HOWARD and COSTLY, moron
hoodlums, along with several friends, over by a car on the
other side of the road, drinking forties.

<b>                    HOWARD
</b>          Hey don't film me nigga, don't film
          me.

<b>                    COSTLY
</b>          Hey fuck off, you better run to
          your house, bitch. Run to your
          house and lock the door.

Andrew just stands there filming them. Howard hurls his
forty at Andrew, who doesn't move; it shatters very near to
him.

<b>                    HOWARD
</b>          The fuck, fuck you faggot-
Howard quickly starts crossing the street, and Andrew turns
and runs back towards his house.


<b>INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
</b>
The camera lays on Andrew's bed again, filming the room.
Andrew is on his laptop at a desk, working.

<b>                    ANDREW
</b>          I'm uploading what I shot
          today...you have to keep a back-up,
          you know.

The door suddenly opens, revealing MR. Adrian DETMER, 40s,
Andrew's father. He doesn't look as white trash as you'd
expect.
<b>                                                          9.
</b>

Andrew looks up at him, and then goes back to working.
Detmer goes over to Andrew and slaps him out of his chair.

<b>                    MR. DETMER
</b>          When I say open this door, you open
          this fucking door.

Mr. Detmer leaves, slamming the door on his way out.   Andrew
sits on the floor in silence.


<b>EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - NIGHT
</b>
We're in Matt's car, driving on a dark dirt road, past an old
fence and rusted out farm equipment.

<b>                     ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Are you sure it's here?
              (beat)
          Are you sure it's here, this all
          looks closed-

<b>                    MATT
</b>          It's here, calm down.    Listen.

We can faintly hear party music.

<b>                     ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Oh yeah.


<b>EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - BARN
</b>
Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and
Andrew approach. We see Christmas lights strung up, and
there's clearly a party going on inside the barn. Kids are
milling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around.

<b>                     MATT
</b>          Hey dude, don't follow me around
          all night.

<b>                     ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          What?

<b>                    MATT
</b>          Don't follow me around all night,
          okay?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          What am I supposed to do? I

          go alone-
<b>                                                          10.

<b>                    MATT

</b><b>                                               FOOTAGE...
</b>
Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full
swing. Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking,
girls dancing sexy, guys joking around. Andrew is silent and
detached, just filming. He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16,
filming as well. They shout over the music.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Oh, I don't- just filming.

</b>          I have a video blog!   Why are you

Andrew simply backs away. More footage of the party.
AUSTIN, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere.   He's
clearly a little drunk.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          No, I wasn't filming anyone

          You know that, I should beat your
          ass right now, but I'm trying to be
          nice. Fuck you.

Austin abruptly throws his beer on Andrew, getting some on
the camera, and then spits on him. Andrew backs up, shocked,
lowering the camera.


<b>EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODS
</b>
Andrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the
lens of the camera, obstructing our view. Cut to a few
moments later; the camera now resting in his lap or on the
ground. We can see the barn, the party still going on.

After a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying.

<b>                    STEVE (O.S.)

          Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a
          camera?

The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17,
approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing,
instantly likeable charisma.

He's a little drunk and giddy.

<b>                    STEVE (CONT'D)

</b>          I don't-

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Dude, come on, we found something.


<b>EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - FIELD
</b>
Steve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass, toward
woods. It's rather dark.
<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Look, I don't think we're supposed
          to-

<b>                    STEVE

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-

The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with
it. The light clicks on, illuminating Steve.

<b>                     STEVE
</b>          Awesome.

<b>                                                     CUT.

</b>

They've reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the
remains of a fence. The light bounces around wildly.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          What were you guys doing out here?
          This is way out-

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Me and your cousin were blazing a
          little.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Matt's out here?

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          A bunch of people were out here,
          but I think they've all gone back,
          now, cause we're like, obsessed
          with the thing.

<b>                      ANDREW (O.S.)

<b>                                                     CUT.
</b>
They're in the woods now, thick and dizzying. It's near
silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground.
Steve walks out ahead.

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Andrew Detmer, that's right.   I
          remember you from homeroom,
          Freshman year.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          You remember that?
<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Yeah, I have a memory for faces.
          I'm gonna go into politics, which
          is ironic because I'm soooo fucking
          high right now- probably shouldn't
          be letting you videotape this-

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          president, you have no idea-

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Yeah, video footage of me luring
          you into the woods for gay sex-
          wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?
<b>                                                        14.

</b>          Down here!

<b>                       ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Matt?

The camera turns to reveal Matt, standing next to some kind
of craggy hole in the ground, at the base of a hill in the
woods. It's big, but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to
the camera. It looks like a big black spot.

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          There we go. There it is.

<b>                                                     CUT.
</b>
Andrew and Steve are now down with Matt by the hole. Andrew
is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness,
nervous.

<b>                    STEVE (V.O.)
</b>          Where is everybody?

<b>                    MATT
</b>          They all left.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          We're not supposed to be out here.

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Is it still making the sound?

<b>                     MATT
</b>          Yeah.   Did you tell Andrew?

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound-

<b>                    MATT
</b>          Here, listen.

<b>                       ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Guys-

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          You've got to get really close to
          hear it.

Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Guys, just don't like- don't push
          me, or do anything like that-
<b>                                                         15.
</b>

<b>                    STEVE (O.S.)
</b>          You've got to go closer.     Like
          almost inside it.

There's a beat.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          We're not going to push you, we
          just wanna get it on tape.

Another pause. Andrew moves towards the hole. Even with
Nightvision, it's completely dark in there. A beat.

<b>                    STEVE (O.S.)
</b>          Do you hear it?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          ...It's like, whispering?

<b>                       STEVE (O.S.)
</b>          Listen.

<b>                       ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Singing?

<b>         MATT (O.S.)                       STEVE (O.S.)
</b>Ooooh shiiiiit-                   That is so fucking creepy!

Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          What is that?

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          We didn't dig the hole, man.
<b>                    MATT
</b>          Is the sound on the camera?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          I don't know, probably...I mean,
          it's- it's kinda loud, right?

Matt looks to Steve.

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Do you guys wanna go in and have a
          look, or what-

Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into the
darkness.

<b>                       ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Hey, wait-

          it's stable in there- It's probably
          just the wind, we should-

Andrew abruptly goes into the cave.

<b>                    MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Andrew, hey, come on!
          Don't...shit.


<b>INT. THE HOLE
</b>
It's almost pitch black, but we can hear Andrew breathing.
It's claustrophobic in here. Eerily quiet. The camera
searches around, but the walls are tight in here, and low.

<b>                       ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Hello-

<b>             STEVE                        ANDREW (O.S.)

I'm right here.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Does it go down much deeper, or-

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Yeah, really far. It's not a cave,
          it's like a tunnel- do you hear how
          loud that's getting?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Do you think it could be like wind,
          or-

<b>                   STEVE

          ghosts.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Who said anything about ghosts.

Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.
Andrew follows.

<b>                                                     CUT.

Matt's face is suddenly in front of the camera.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          -shouldn't have come in here.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Steve's up ahead-

<b>                     MATT
</b>          At first I thought this was a
          solutional cave, but now...I dunno,
          it's like a lava tube, or
          something.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)

          about.

<b>                    MATT

          smooth they are. It's just
          straight shot down, I mean, we

          feet-

Walking. Darkness. The cave is even tighter now. The light
flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out
completely We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the
nightvision mode comes on.

<b>                                                      CUT.

The nightvision is scrambling badly.   All the forms are
distorted and then-

<b>                    STEVE (O.S.)
</b>          Can you believe this, this is NUTS-

The nightvision is turned off, revealing Matt. They've come
into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from
within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise
glow.

They speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can't
hear.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          Is that, is that showing up on the
          camera?

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          I don't wanna film it, it's messing
          with the camera-

Matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing next
to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing
from, or maybe embedded in, the wall. Around it, and him,
float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.

Steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the
light.
<b>                       STEVE
</b>          Touch one!

We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora
borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent
little explosion of light, beautiful.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...

A light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his hand
to extend to touch it. The subsequent little light burst
badly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.

Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed
up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow. The light
clouds have turned yellow. Matt is practically inside the
structure, pressing it with his palms.

<b>                    MATT

          awesome!

Matt presses with his palms. There's a low sustained hiss as
the light clouds turn an angry shade of red. A stream of
them is released from beneath the structure. The camera
jerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears.

<b>                     STEVE (CONT'D)
</b><b>          AGHHHHH!
</b>
Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth
and nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly
and we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline
structure.

It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart,
revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; we
can suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and the
camera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the
tunnel-

<b>FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.
</b>

<b>EXT. MATT'S BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
</b>
The camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's
immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera.
It's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured
backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.
<b>                                                        20.

</b>          Rolling, yeah.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          Okay, ball test.   Take one.

A baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing
Matt in the face; he drops like a rock.

<b>                     MATT (CONT'D)
</b><b>          OW FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!
</b><b>          UNDERHAND!
</b>
Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can
hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-

<b>                                                     CUT.

Now it's Steve who stands on the yard.

<b>                     STEVE (CONT'D)
</b>          Go.

A baseball comes in from off camera, slower. It comes down
towards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre,
impossible course correction, FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THE
<b>FACE.
</b><b>                     STEVE (CONT'D)
</b><b>          AGH!   HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!
</b>Matt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice-
pack to his face. Again, we hear Andrew laughing.

</b>
Andrew's out across the yard. He looks a little better; he's
gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is a
little better kept. He nods.

In flies the baseball. It abruptly stops in the air, a foot
and a half from Andrew's face. Steve and Matt let out a
cheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to show
a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and
Andrew.
<b>                                                         21.

Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.   A trickle
of blood comes out of his nose.

<b>                      ANDREW
</b>          Ah, shit.

<b>                                                      CUT.
</b>
The camera's on a tripod up on the back porch, filming
Andrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle. They are playing
catch...no hands. The ball simply flies from guy to guy.
They drop it a few times in some cuts, but shout
encouragement, and are clearly having a good time.

Finally, they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast.   Matt looks
up.

<b>                      MATT
</b>          Is-

Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew
rush to him, laughing.

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          `In the- penis- the penis-

</b>

<b>INT. MATT'S KITCHEN
</b>
Steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving over
bread. The camera is set down on the counter, Matt and
Andrew watching.

<b>                    ANDREW
</b>          The trick is to pretend like it's
          on a plate. You get it on the
          plate and then you wrap the plate
          around it, and you can move it
          however you want.

<b>                      STEVE
</b>          Mhm.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          I've been pretending I was like,
          holding it in a fist, like a
          floating hand.
<b>                                                          22.

<b>                     ANDREW

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Guys, check it out.

Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter
floating freely. They slap together and then down onto the
bread, which slaps closed.

<b>                     STEVE (CONT'D)
</b>          Ha!

          Shit, shit-


<b>INT. MATT'S ROOM - LATER
</b>
Matt's room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess.
Matt's sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling a
LEGO set with his telekinetic abilities. Andrew's filming
from the bed, where he's laying down.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Try to imagine that your squeezing

<b>                    MATT

<b>                    ANDREW

Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together.

Andrew and Matt are laughing as Steve enters, holding out his
cell phone.

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Guys, listen, listen.   Samantha.

Steve puts his voice-mail on speaker.   SAMANTHA Pezon, 16,
sounds a bit frustrated.
<b>                                                  23.

          soccer practice, but you said the
          only reason you couldn't come see
          Bound By Love with me was because
          of soccer practice, so...You know,
          I just, I don't know what to think.
          I feel like we never hang out
          anymore, you've just been hanging
          out with those two guys for the

Steve laughs.

</b>          My mom has spinal meningitis, she's-
          she can't work or anything, and the
          insurance doesn't cover all of her
          medicine, so a lot of my money has
          to go into that. I figure if I get
          enough on camera, maybe I can, I
          dunno, get custody of her or
          something.

Steve mulls this over.

A frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling
on the cart. It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes
careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it. We
can hear the guys cracking up, trying to stay quiet.

One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the

takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled
laughter.

the air, makes a full 180 degree rotation, and then wobbles
through the air over to a spot several spaces away, and then
sets down, neatly in place.

The camera moves around to show the woman returning to the
space where her car was parked. She stops, baffled, and
looks around. We hear the guys stifle laughter.

She notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it,
looking around. Andrew tries to get a better angle, and she
notices him, and stares.

He hands off the camera to Steve; now we see Andrew sitting
in the back seat. Behind him, through the back window, we
can see a pick-up truck, honking, way too close.

<b>                    ANDREW (CONT'D)

Andrew flicks his hand at the truck. The effect is

The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a
moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge;
the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet
below. We tilt up to see Steve taking off his jacket.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)

a moment, swimming to the car.

The camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it
moves across the floor. It crawls up onto the side of the
bed, then onto the sheets. Andrew's finger points at it.

The spider is telekinetically lifted into the air.    It hangs
struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.

He spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates
into all of its component parts. They stop moving, hanging
lifeless.

Andrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider.    Rings
again.

Andrew throws himself forward.   And stops, hanging in mid
air.

Matt moves in for a closer look at floating Andrew, and gives
a glance up at Steve, who's cheering on the telephone pole.

<b>EXT. SKY
</b>
At first it's not clear what we're looking at, just blue sky.
Wind is very loud. The camera pans down to reveal we're FIVE
THOUSAND FEET IN THE AIR, in a clearing between two larger
cloudbanks.

The camera pans all the way down to show Andrew's dangling
feet, and below them, the impossibly far drop. We can hear
Andrew laugh.

We can see Steve and Matt, nearby, now wearing winter-coats
and hats to keep warm. They're playing catch with a
football. Steve tosses it to Andrew, who actually goes into
a short dive to catch it. He looks up to see Steve and Matt
distantly cheering and waving their approval.

Steve's holding the camera, filming Andrew attempting a few
fancy moves, but he's a clumsy flier. Matt does a few neater
tricks in some clips.

<b>                      STEVE (O.S.)

<b>                     STEVE (O.S.)

<b>                    MATT
</b>          It's about aerodynamics! If I put
          a barrier just in front of me, I
          can go way faster, cause it cuts
          wind resistance!

Steve and Matt are seen flying around, Steve further away,
near a large cloud bank. Matt is using his abilities to
shape cloud fluff into an M. There is a humming, rattling
sound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          Guys, do you hear that?

Neither of the guys can hear him. Steve however stops in the
distance, looking around. He shouts something, inaudible.

<b>                     ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          What?   I can't hear you!

Steve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging.

A BOEING 737 BLOWS OUT OF THE CLOUDBANK BEHIND STEVE.    He's
spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock.
Suddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the
camera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead.
The camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it
swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in
some tall grass. Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve
come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting
apart.

They lay there, breathing hard. Andrew sits up, coughing;
his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding. Steve suddenly leaps up.

<b>                    STEVE

          What the hell, what the hell-

out.

Steve, Matt and Andrew are sitting around the pool outside of
Steve's house; empty beers are all around. All three are at
least tipsy.

Matt is up.

Andrew and Matt manipulate snakes of the glowing fluid at
each other; it's beautiful.

We cut between three sing alongs; "Shake That" by Nate Dogg
and Eminem (which Andrew protests too, as he doesn't know the
lyrics), "How You Remind Me" by Nickelback, and "Macho Man"
by The Village People.


<b>INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The guys are in that sleepy mode, now. Andrew's filming, but
not really focusing on anything. Matt's sprawled out on a
couch opposite him. Steve's in a chair nearby.

<b>                    MATT

<b>                    STEVE
</b>          Well, I mean, she notices that it's
          gotten better, definitely. You
          just have to be subtle.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)

Later. Drowsier. Light's coming from the TV. The camera is
laying haphazardly on Andrew. They're all nearly asleep,
drowsy drunk.

A POLICE OFFICER appears.

<b>                    MATT

At first, it's just a shot off Matt's feet, the camera
pointing down, and we can hear hub-bub all around. It goes
to nightvision for a moment, then over-exposes, then back to
normal.

The camera is levelled, showing a high-school auditorium's
stage. A group of kids are playing screamo music. Cut, a
little later. A girl is singing. Cut. Casey, the girl with
the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty
dancing. She's good. The camera lingers on her.

It's a few minutes later. "Techno-Syndrome" (MORTAL KOMBAT!)
begins to play. There's a beat, and then Steve, in a tuxedo,
rushes out onto stage. The applause is DEAFENING, girls
screaming, etc.

He raises his hands for silence, and then "presents" Andrew,
also in a tuxedo. Mixed reaction from the crowd. Andrew's
carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto
the floor. Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in
exasperation.

Andrew is juggling, six balls at once. Steve is drinking a
soda, and offers Andrew the soda. Andrew is annoyed. Steve
pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda. Andrew
stops juggling, leaving all the balls hanging in the air, and
snatches away Steve's soda.

Steve lunges after him and gets back his soda, only to have
all the balls drop out of the air and hit him. The audience
is LOSING THEIR FREAKING MINDS.

Andrew is transporting buckets of water across the stage,
spilling water everywhere. Steve is pantomiming anger at the
shoddy job he's doing. Andrew pantomimes "Well, you try."
Steve tries, but trips and falls, sending the contents of the
bucket flying out over the audience-

-only for it to seemingly REWIND back into the bucket!    The
place GOES BERZERK.

hear Matt cheering behind the camera.

keep coming up to Andrew and telling him "That was awesome!"
Or "You fucking rock!" Andrew sheepishly acknowledges this.
Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing
is talking. This is MONICA, 16. She's a little drunk.

Andrew to join her on a beer-pong team. A little tipsy,
Andrew agrees, setting down the camera on a couch. It lays

dancing, talking, a people taking shots. Casey passes,

</b>Mr. Detmer hurls the camera directly into Andrew's face.    It
knocks him down and clatters to the floor.

Detmer rushes up to Andrew and slaps him, and again, and
again, and again, and WHAM! Andrew backhands Detmer HARD,
flooring him. Andrew turns and picks up the camera, leveling
it coolly on his father as he tries to stand.

Andrew's arm snakes out and grabs Detmer by his throat,
lifting him easily and slamming him against the wall.

Andrew turns and flings Mr. Detmer into the sofa, which flips
on the impact. We can hear Andrew's gasping sobs, panicked,
as he turns, runs out of the house, and LAUNCHES INTO THE
<b>AIR.

<b>EXT. THE THUNDERSTORM
</b>
Andrew's just below the clouds, massive dark and ominous
above him. It's clearly not safe, rain and wind whipping his
body, lightning crackling inside the clouds. We can hear him
breathing hard.

He touches the bottom of a cloud, and gets a powerful
electric shock, forcing him to back off a tiny bit.

filming from within the mourning party.

A large picture of Steve is on a stand as the priest reads a
eulogy. Andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight and
confined, back to how they were when we first started.

We see Steve's mother and father. His mother is sobbing.
His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.
Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.
There's Samantha, crying uncontrollably. The camera passes
Matt...

Who's staring directly at us.

<b>                                                       CUT.

          You can look that up online, you

Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull
the camera away. He's suddenly shoved backwards; Matt
recovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew. The
camera hangs limply for a moment.

<b>                    MATT (CONT'D)

          What did you do, Andrew? What am I

          tell? I mean- I don't, I don't
          know how I'm supposed to- Why won't
          you just tell me what happened?

The camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketing
away from Matt.


<b>INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
</b>
The camera is on Andrew's dresser, near his mirror.   Andrew
suddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife.

<b>                    ANDREW
</b>              (addressing the camera)
          -wanted to show you what I was
          talking about.

Andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm. He
takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh
of his wrist. He drags the blade down hard, all the way to
his elbow...but no cut appears. He then violently jabs
himself several times...but no penetration.

<b>                    ANDREW (CONT'D)
</b>          See, it's- I put a little sheet
          between myself and the knife, and
          the barrier, the sheet, is too
          strong. The knife can't cut it. I
          mean like, what I'm saying is if I
          concentrate, I can't be hurt. I
          can't be injured. Because of the
          little sheet.


<b>EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD

Andrew sits alone on the bleachers. The cheerleaders are
practicing. The camera zooms in on Samantha. She sits alone
on the sidelines, watching numbly.

<b>INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY

Andrew is putting his stuff away in his locker. He's
suddenly shoved into the locker roughly. The camera turns,
revealing Wayne walking away.

The camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly, then goes
back to Wayne, now almost twenty feet away.

One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly
gushes blood. Wayne screams, falling, and is immediately
tended to by other students.


<b>INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - BATHROOM STALL
</b>
Andrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of
the toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one.

They're Wayne's bloody teeth.

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>          See, this one, I got clean, cause I

          but these two, they're broken cause
          I think I pulled them from the
          middle. Matt was always better at
          the little, the intricate stuff, he
          got good at that. See how broken
          it is, ugh, sloppy.

mirror, filming himself filming. After a beat, he steps out
from behind the camera, leaving it hanging in the air.

<b>EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

The junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old

you can tell he's not supposed to be in here.

pulls an old car forward, and lifts it easily. He moves it
left, moves it right, rolls it, sets it back down.

          The strongest animals will always
          survive, and they're the ones that
          you know, will prosper, or grow,
          and survive, by feeding on the
          smaller animals. And as humans we-

          There's this thing called an Apex
          Predator, and basically what that
          is the most powerful predator in an
          ecosystem. And humans, you know,
          we're the apex predator, because
          there's nothing that preys on us,
          cause of weapons and stuff. But if
          something could, I bet it would.

          kills a gazelle. You don't feel
          guilty when you squash a fly, you

          something. I think it really means

Andrew's back out with the car. He lifts it again, then
makes a quick "squeezing" motion. As he does this, the car
violently compresses down to the size of a basketball.
Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, which
collapses loudly.

Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as
he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which
bites him twice before he's able to fling it off.

The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand,
blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly.

Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off.

muffled by kissing.

Screaming from Sandra's bedroom. The heater rattling. The

Matt stands staring at Andrew. The camera fidgets
uncomfortably. Matt shakes his head, and the camera follows

<b>INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - LATER

Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave.
His stereo plays David Bowie. Once his dad's car is gone,
Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the
mirror, and leaves the room.

Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate. He
opens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform. We
do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at
it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof
inner lining is exposed.

"Ziggy Stardust" comes on Andrew's stereo.

Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror,
his back to the camera. He reaches down, and picks something
up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head.

It's a gas mask.

He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless
figure in the mirror. Looks right. Looks left. Adjusts the
mask.

Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly
yanked across the room.

<b>EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SUNSET
</b>
It's a run-down house in Andrew's neighborhood. The
streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in
yellow orange haze.

Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the
porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt. They clearly
haven't noticed Andrew, who's filming from out by the street.

He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the
house. It flies up and breaks a window. Costly, Howard and
the thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing as
they rapidly surround Andrew.

He doesn't react.

<b>                    HOWARD

Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in front
of the camera. He makes the "gun sign."

<b>                    ANDREW (O.S.)
</b>              (firing the finger gun)
          Bang.

Howard's body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loud
chorus of cracks, and then is FLUNG ASIDE. The thugs,
shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrew
telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending him
smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car.

Costly and the remaining thug start running, and the
remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him,
breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before he's
propelled face first into the ground, WHAM.

Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front of
Costly, who skids to a halt.

<b>                     COSTLY
</b>          -no, no-

Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as
though under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving a
glistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he falls
across the curb.

We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but
other than that, the night is silent.

Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loose
money lift away from them, flying to him. There's a beat,
and then Andrew launches into the air.


<b>EXT. RADIOTOWER - 80 FEET UP - TWILIGHT
</b>
Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on
one of the strut supports. The camera sits nearby, watching
the expressionless figure as it counts the money.

There's a beat and he hangs his head. We can hear muffled
noises of frustration from under the mask. Something that
sounds like a low, angry scream.

Very suddenly, he dives off the tower. A second later, the
camera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall.

<b>EXT. GAS STATION
</b>
Andrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gas
station. He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towards
it. We transition to...


<b>FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS.
</b>
Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio.

We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure
in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front
of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station
store.


<b>INT. GAS STATION
</b>
The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store.
Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, who
says something, looking concerned. He's suddenly blown out
of frame.
After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter,
and floats over to Andrew.

Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him;
as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling. He
goes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun.


<b>EXT. GAS STATION
</b>
Andrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells,
raising the shotgun.
Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires as
he's hit by a wave of energy. The shotgun blast goes wild,
striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage.

The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire
envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look
through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.


<b>FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.
</b>
The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audio
from its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING.

It's been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who lays
motionless, burning.
<b>                                                       76.
</b>

The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer is
horribly injured and screaming. His gas pump lays on the
ground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt.

Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces
himself to roll over. The fire on his body touches the fire
on the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump.

The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station.

The camera is spun violently out into the street-

<b>                                                  VIOLENT

<b>INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
</b>
The camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat
distorted audio. The image is a little blown out.

Andrew on a bed. His entire right side is absolutely
scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper,
blackened and red. The parts of him that are bandaged are
already soaked through with blood.

He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines.
Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon. This is ensured
by the handcuff on his left wrist.

The machines beep. Andrew doesn't move. The door opens, and
Mr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the
other side of the door.

<b>                    MR. DETMER
</b>          -come down to the city, cause his
          mother's all alone right now.
          She's got MS, I had to leave her at
          the house all a fucking alone.

<b>                    POLICE DETECTIVE
</b>          I understand, Mr. Detmer.

<b>                    MR. DETMER
</b>          Shit. Jesus, look at this.   Can I
          have a moment with my son.

<b>                    POLICE DETECTIVE
</b>          Yeah I- I'll be outside the door,
          yeah?
<b>                                                        77.
</b>

<b>                      MR. DETMER
</b>          Okay.

The officer closes the door, and Mr. Detmer goes and sits
down in a chair next to the bed. He sits there staring at
Andrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in
his hands. We SPEED UP THE RECORDING, and Detmer just sits
like that. After five minutes of speed up, we slow down.

<b>                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
</b>          I want you to apologize to me.

Andrew is comatose.

<b>                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
</b>          I said I want you to apologize to
          me. I know you can hear me. So I
          want you to sit up and apologize to
          me. I want you to stop this
          bullshit right now.

Andrew is comatose.

<b>                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you know how much this shit is
          going to cost me? Do you know what
          you've done to your family?
              (beat)
          You don't even care, do you? You
          just don't give a fuck, you've got
          your fucking morphine, don't you.

There's a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrew's burnt
shoulder. Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on
the monitor.
<b>                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
</b>          Stop it. I'm not buying this shit,
          you can't just play this off like a

          know that, you little
              (slap)
          Shit.
Andrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding
molten welts. Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a
quick pace forward and back.

<b>                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)

</b>

Detmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrew's arm jerks up.
Mr. Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air.

He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes
rigid.

Andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates
into all of his component parts.
They stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground
in a bloody mess.

Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball
hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of
agony, and then another, tearing at his IV.

The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to
the gore that was Andrew's father. They barely have time to
scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and
lets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing apart
everything in the room including the camera.

happy.

Everyone let's out a cheer, including Casey, but then she

We get a helicopter view from over downtown Portland,
everything seems okay, and then something streaks by,
crashing headlong into the side of a building.

winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex. We hear another
of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes
back to the TV, revealing the big MADE IN OREGON sign in Old
Town toppling down into the street.

They're getting into downtown now. We can hear sirens.
Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal,
until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to
reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed
on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.

There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains
down onto the car. Matt slams on the brakes, looking up
through the windshield, searching the sky.

<b>                    MATT
</b>          Where are you, man?

There's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on
the passenger's side, next to Casey.

<b>                    POLICE OFFICER

The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight

Casey screams.

</b>          What's...What is...What's...Matt
          please, please-

The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flipping
end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes
to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet. Casey's
breathing is painfully short and sharp. Matt stares out into
the night sky.

He flicks on the brights. There's Andrew, in his hospital
gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and
twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.
A news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a
moment, Andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight.

His eyes flash to the car.

<b>                    ANDREW
</b>              (screaming)
<b>          WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?

The car goes into freefall, no longer important to Andrew,
plummeting down, down, down. Casey's screams are barely
audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush
past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to
her death.

And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting,
the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred
views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...

Stillness. Casey's camera is pointed down, showing her
adidas...and Matt's high-tops.

NOTE: In the following sequence, everything is seen in
glimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing.
Much of what happens should be seen through implication,
rather than direct effect.

Everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras can
fully keep track.


<b>FROM SEVERAL HELICAMS.

The feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio,
meaning no narration from the reporter. There are several
chopper's flying at different distances from the action, and
we intercut as necessary.

<b>EXT. DOWNTOWN PORTLAND
</b>
The news chopper at first shows Casey's destroyed car laying
in the street, then pans back up to show Andrew, who's
floating hunched over, vomiting.

Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew
shoves him away. We're too far away to hear anything that's
said.

Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something. Matt, clearly
upset, replies. Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures
towards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but
Andrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the
destruction, and says something gently.

Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a
radical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerned;
he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at
Matt.

Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents.
Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something
to his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING HIM
<b>LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.
</b>Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper;
a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.


<b>FROM MICHAEL ERNESTO'S CAMERA.
</b>
MICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from his
building, out on his roof. He watches in horror as the
helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of
frame.
Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.

<b>                    MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)

          shit oh shit-

Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded
bird, crashing into the roof. He vomits again, mostly bile;
everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in
pain and rolls over.

          gonna help me now...

We get some shots from other people's cameras, video phones,
etc on the roof. Some people scream and try to run past
Andrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins,
which leads to more screaming.

Andrew stands shakily, looking directly at Michael Ernesto.

The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to a
halt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT OF

</b>The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's not
impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guys
fighting for their lives. Matt gets the upperhand, decking
Andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop
car (our POV), lifts off.

WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns
and creates a telekinetic wall.

The two boys come smashing up through the roof of the
apartment building. Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase.
Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at
street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees,
etc...
...But Matt's too good a flyer. What he doesn't block he
simply dips and weaves around. Andrew, clearly still woozy,
is distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out on
the asphalt.
<b>                    CAMERA-MAN
</b>          They're down. One of them just
          went down. Jesus christ.

Matt slowly lands nearby. The camera zooms in and hits them
both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and
look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.

We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matt's
face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth
and ears. He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly
covered with injuries. He looks like he's been in a car
wreck.

<b>                    CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)

He approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently. Andrew
just shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to
stand, like a wounded dog.

Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading
and taking cover. One of them advances on Matt and Andrew,
gun raised. Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective,
pleading, raising his hands.

The cop is clearly panicked. He fires a shot.    Matt's arm
whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain,
holding his hand, which is gushing blood.

Andrew approaches Matt, screaming and looking absolutely
terrifying. Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew
following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.

past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging
at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man,

-Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a
massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing
downwards as though shot out of a cannon.
They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," a
trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves
building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to
the ground.

Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops
down at a broken, dead angle. Andrew lands nearly as badly,
lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and
screaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him.

The statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street.
Andrew writhes. Matt is motionless, blood pooling around
him, his back broken.


<b>FROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS, HELICOPTER CAMERAS, HANDHELDS
</b><b>FROM WINDOWS, EVERYTHING.
</b>
A bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the
front of the Michael Graves building and downed statue. Matt
and Andrew's bodies are painted by spotlights as police and
news helicopters hang overhead.

Police unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a
perimeter and pushing in. We're with them as they approach;
the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting
back and forth to each other.
Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots.

Andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the
bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and
he shakily raises both hands.

The all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are
telekinetically lifted into the air.

They hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their
limbs go rigid. We've seen this before.

Andrew screams, and then...It all happens in under two
seconds:
<b>                                                         89.
</b>

Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of
Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard,
first through Andrew, then into the pavement.

Andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then
Matt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out,
striking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly.

All of the floating people drop, dazed.

Matt collapses.   After a moment, the police advance.

<b>FROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS.
</b>
The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear,
with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the
top and bottom of the screens.

Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room. At the far
end is a blackened out two way mirror. There's a camera on
the inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits
reflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable
expressions.

There is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out of
the chair. It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of
the Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical
attention.

To this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things,
massive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes
and cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back.
He can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own
blood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the
cameras.

He is barely coherent, screeching in agony.

<b>                    MATT

          stars, somebody- It hurts, please.
          I'm- the blood...I tried...

Two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some
kind of radiation sensors. They go over to Matt, scanning
him.

The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, his
eyes going wide.

<b>                    MATT (CONT'D)
</b>          I can...I can hear the singing.

Matt entirely stops moving.   He lays there, not breathing,
completely still.

And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the
table and the chair. There are a series of grotesque popping
and snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and
writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.

The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we
realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.
His broken bones have already molded back into place. His
bruises are shrinking away to nothing.

The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its
frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking
military personnel, along with several men in civilian
clothes.

Matt stares at them.   They stare back at him.

Matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off.
Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.

Kim Hai-Su, 17, is behind the camera filming his father, 40s,

Kim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room,
crying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down
the camera.

They pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped
into gridlocked, dead-end traffic. Kim Hai-Su's father
begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which
triggers his younger brother crying again. Kim shouts to
calm down.

Kim is climbing out of the car; people all around are getting
out of their cars, hopelessly trapped. Someone screams, and
Kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away.

Rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack, which
splits further. Kim yells in fear. The crack widens, an
enormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down the
side of the hills into the valley.
Kim's father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange,
when suddenly there's the sound of a sonic boom overhead.

All around them people EXPLODE into cheers. It's not fear,
but rather a kind of frantic ovation. The camera sweeps up,
panning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to rest
on

Matt Garrety.

Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway. He
pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!" This gets the
intended response, and he pumps a fist shouting "FUCK YEAH
<b>KOREA!"

He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the
first time, mouths "Oh shit!" Points at the flood casually
as it closes in: "I should deal with this." Another huge
ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!"
and turns.

There's a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less
than a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearing
into the distance over the flood.

After a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to
stop, slowing and freezing in place, and then...SLOWLY BEGINS
<b>TO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM.
</b>The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane,
embracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars. Kim's
father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car, and
Kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his
lungs.

The camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going
positively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and
down, screaming, smiling...
