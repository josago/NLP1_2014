          Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the
          sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running.
          HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice,
          glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She
          is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost
          completely into the landscape of trees and snow.
          She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air.
          Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling
          the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head
          pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of
          an arrow piercing its skin.
          The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet
          dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam
          pouring from its nostrils.
          HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her
          knees.
          She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face.
          She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          I just missed your heart.
          She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist
          holster.
          She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.

          A knife enters the deer near its anus.

          She works calmly without expression.

          The deer lies on it's side.
          HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity
          and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver.
          She freezes, sensing danger.
          Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out
          into the still forest. No sound.
          ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands
          behind her like a ghost.

<b>                         ERIK
</b>          You're dead. Right now. I've
          killed you.
          HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings
          her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open
          palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the
          snow.
          She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She
          dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her
          pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.

<b>          ERIK (CONT'D)
</b>          Use your hands!
          She goes for the gun again and again he stops her.
          He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and
          tossing it deep into the forest.
          HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground.
          She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap...
          ... but she can't.
          He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.
          ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows
          a touch of frustration.
          He plods into the forest.

<b>          ERIK (CONT'D)
</b>          Drag it back yourself.
          HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its
          dead face.

          HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on
          to a stick. No sign she was ever there.

<b>          5 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5
</b>
          HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts
          her knees high and moves at a steady pace.
          Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching
          her.

<b>          6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6
</b>
          A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the
          thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the
          deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss.

<b>          7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7
</b>
          Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves
          using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions
          that have been brought in from the outside world are old and
          worn.
          HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the
          drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to
          some dried leaves.

</b>
          HANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire, still dressed
          in furs.
          HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a
          mouthful, watches HANNA not eating.

          to her from an old encyclopedia.

</b>          The Great Blue Whale is the largest
          animal to have ever existed. A blue

          a half tons and its mouth is large
          enough to hold 90 tons of food and

</b>          Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares
          after her.

<b>          19 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 19
</b>
          Outside, ERIK stands alone, thinking. An OWL swoops down to
          catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops.

<b>          20 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT. 20
</b>
          HANNA is asleep.
          ERIK enters the room.
          ERIK approaches the bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and
          aims it at HANNA. He is tense with expectation.
          Suddenly HANNA bursts from her covers, smashes the pistol
          from ERIK's hand and smashes him down on to the bed. She
          grabs the pistol and points it at his face. She is alert,
          eyes intense, face proud. She speaks quietly.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          I'm ready now.

<b>                         ERIK
</b>          Maybe.
          ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat.
          He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be
          really trying to hurt her.
          But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint
          knife - in an instant it is at ERIK's neck. She pricks his
          neck slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and
          silence. HANNA breathless, angry.

<b>          ERIK (CONT'D)
</b>          You didn't tell me you had a knife.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          You told me to think for myself.
          Isn't that what you want?
          She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just
          stares at her.

<b>          HANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          I want to see things. I can't stay
          here forever.

          ERIK takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin.
          He counts his paces.

<b>                         ERIK
</b>          One, two, three, four...

<b>          22 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY 22
</b>
          ERIK and HANNA are racing through the forest.
          Over this we continue to hear ERIK counting his paces from
          the previous scene.

<b>          ERIK (V.O.)
</b>          ...five, six, seven, eight...

</b>

<b>                         ERIK
</b>          ...nine, ten.
          After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the
          tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots.
          We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of
          HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All
          the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces.
          After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to
          his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the
          frozen earth.

<b>          24 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - MORNING 24
</b>
          HANNA comes out of the cabin, rubbing her eyes and yawning,
          eating a hunk of cold meat.
          She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree
          line. She crouches and holds out what's left of her
          breakfast.
          The fox approaches gingerly, delicately.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          Hello little foxy... foxy loxy...
          come on... come and share my
          breakfast.
          The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap,
          withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward
          carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          11.
</b>          As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA
          expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up, puzzled - they
          seem to have a genuine connection - as if they've done this
          before.
          Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up,
          HANNA looks up too.
          An aeroplane is approaching overhead. The fox darts back into
          the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through
          the forest.
          HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and
          dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree. The plane
          roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness,
          oblivious to HANNA'S tiny presence.
          It's only now that we see the full extent of HANNA'S
          isolation.

<b>          25 INT. CABIN - MORNING. 25
</b>
          HANNA enters breathless with excitement. ERIK sits pensively
          with his back to the door.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          Did you see it? Wasn't it
          beautiful, like thunder. I had to
          stick my fingers in my ears it was
          so loud. Did you hear it?
          She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood.

<b>          HANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          What's wrong?
          Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case, caked with frozen
          dirt. ERIK pops open the case. Inside a tangle of technology.
          HANNA looks at the case, mesmerized.

<b>          HANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          What does it do?

<b>                         ERIK

          She approaches the box and places a single finger on the
          small red switch.

</b>          You're not scaring me.
          He looks at her disbelievingly.
          She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away
          from the switch.
          He softens towards her.

<b>                         ERIK
</b>          It's here. There's no rush. Take
          your time.
          HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking
          another look at it over her shoulder.

<b>          26 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 26

          HANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from
          the encyclopedia.

<b>                         ERIK
</b>          Laika, a mongrel dog from the
          streets of Moscow, was the first
          animal to orbit the Earth. She was
          launched into outer space on the
          third of November, 1957.
          Scientists believed humans would be
          unable to survive conditions of
          outer space, so flights by animals
          were viewed as an experimental
          precursor to human missions. Her
          rocket was not designed to be
          retrievable, and Laika had always
          been intended to die.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          That's sad.

          might be.

          ERIK leaves abruptly.
          HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her
          closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the
          box. She turns and walks out of the cabin.

          HANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk.
          She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing. It comes over and
          noses around the cabin, but HANNA'S mind is elsewhere.

          flash.

          hair, reaches over and slams the alarm clock off.
          She's alone in her bed. She always is. She has no children.
          She's made choices in her life and lives without looking
          back.
          She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in

          He walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering
          on. HANNA sees this and sees him smile, but she knows he's

          He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and

          smashing a glass test tube, she cuts the doctor's neck, then
          turns and does the same to the other one.
          HANNA looks round, trying to find a way out. Then she sees
          something on the desk. It is a file with a photo of herself
          clipped to it and a collection of papers - she scans it and
          reads in several places the letters â€œDNA.â€�
          But before she has time to read properly, she hears a female
          voice from outside the lab.

          buzz of the lab's lighting and the whir of the air-

          Then the GUARD hears a rustling from behind her and tenses
          up.

          wall, about waist height.
          She puts a foot on a rail, halls herself up towards the vent.

          The gradient has got steeper and she starts to slide
          backwards on the smooth metal surface. She digs her fingers
          into the rivets joining the plates of stainless steel, trying
          to get a purchase.

          immediately starts sliding... she tumbles, gathering pace,
          falling down a long chute into the blackness. She has no idea

          light. She crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of
          manhole cover with a sprung lever - she wrenches the lever
          and pushes against it. After a little effort the cover gives
          way and light floods in, blinding her.

          of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed. Total
          silence now, except for the whistle of the wind on sand. It
          takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light.
          Blearily she looks out across this alien environment.
          After a moment her ears prick up. She turns just in time to
          see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the
          distance behind her. The jeeps are crawling straight towards
          her, ominously shimmering in the desert heat. She quickly
          ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits.

          In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene, looking for
          HANNA. A military truck is stationery. Nothing around for
          miles. We hear a military voice on a radio.

          Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right
          over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle
          crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away.
          One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes
          over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness.

          He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars.
          Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the

          hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the
          oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor
          flashing beneath her.
          The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune.
          HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches
          her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the
          jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune.
          HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she
          slows and stops. She lies still and shocked by the quiet as
          the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she sits up and
          looks around herself. She has no conception of this
          landscape, no idea where she might be.

          it.

</b>          There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road
          and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare.
          MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks
          through binoculars at the car.
          She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward.
          JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the
          head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA
          stops dead.
          Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger
          ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in
          his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood.
          MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to
          her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement
          and throws himself to the ground.
          Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK
          and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER
          grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest,
          MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives
          into the forest.

          The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are
          longer, but the heat is still intense.
          HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes
          scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a
          growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless
          sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea
          where she might be.

          falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a
          GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun.
          HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun.
          The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age
          but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and
          bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this
          perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe
          in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where
          she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL.

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          Hello.
          HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite
          direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks
          in the distance.

<b>          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
</b>          All right?
          HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.

<b>          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't you speak English?
          HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person.

<b>          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
</b>          That can't be helped. You look
          terrible.
          At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old,
          rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand
          is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA
          while talking to SOPHIE.

          From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES'S

          SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look at HANNA, then turns and
          disappears over the sand dune.
          HANNA rises to the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back to

          HANNA walking along the side of a tarmac desert road,
          approaching a dusty oasis town.
          HANNA enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks,
          taxis, mules and goats. The impact knocks HANNA backwards,
          assailed by the smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, couscous
          cooking at market stalls, fresh fish and meat, still bloody
          and twitching, hanging in the sun for the flies. She listens
          to the babble of Arabic, her ears, nose and eyes sensitive to
          every conversation and twitch of life. It all overpoweringly
          exotic and visceral to her.
          An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market. HANNA
          stares at her in astonishment. Her wrinkled skin.
          She eyes the abundance of animals - animals she's never seen
          before in her life: Chickens. Goats. A camel, which Hanna
          finds bizarre and hilarious.

          HANNA finds a stall with simple cotton clothing. She chooses
          some cheap clothes and unseen goes around the back of the
          stall. She changes out of her ragged old clothes into her new
          clothes.
          HANNA sees MILES running through the crowds carrying a bag of
          cherries.
          She follows him a little way, onto a busy street with hotels
          and cheap jewellery stores.
          He runs up the steps and enters a small mid-range hotel.

          He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a
          fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is
          fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on
          the edge of the bed.

          increase.
          Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours

          tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but
          it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries
          another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing
          HANNA even more.
          On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East,
          the sound of gunfire.
          The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air
          like a helicopter.
          A telephone beside the bed starts to ring.
          Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo.
          HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls
          through the bathroom door straight into the shower,
          inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her.
          HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if
          it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom.
          In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum,
          the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone
          still shouting.
          HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the
          handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls
          through the door and into the corridor.

          MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is
          now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons
          are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers.
          At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there,
          MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven
          and drinking a scotch.
          ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.

          SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some
          difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes. They belong
          to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities

          assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on to
          their ideals of autonomy and social liberation.

          ISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry
          from behind his dark glasses.
          He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are
          having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He
          scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything.

<b>          106 INT. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 106

          Cars are parking, their headlights on in the dark hull, horns
          blowing, FERRY GUARDS directing people to parking spaces -
          it's chaos.
          SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the
          while.

<b>                         SEB

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Don't be rude.
          They get out, taking with them anything they might need -
          knapsacks, computer games, suit cases.
          They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing
          ISAACS on their way.
          ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks.
          He passes the back of the FAMILY'S van as the camera pushes
          in on its back door. The handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE.

          Inside, the van is as the family left it, but the bench seats
          around the breakfast table are disturbed. One has been opened
          out, the lid taken off, the mattress strewn on the floor -
          inside is a big storage space where HANNA has evidently
          hidden... The crowbar has been discarded there.
          HANNA is trying to get out. She tries the back door but its
          locked.
          She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin,
          the driver's seat. She finds a lock on the door and unlocks.
          She climbs out.

<b>          108 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - DAY 108

          HANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it
          takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks
          over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat.
          A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams.
          SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself.

<b>          109 EXT. UPPER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 109

          ISAACS searches the upper deck. Through the bar on the other
          side of the ferry he sees one of his men searching the
          opposite deck.
          A CHILD knocks into ISAACS and the few photocopied
          photographs he has of HANNA fall from his pocket and are
          blown along the deck.
          ISAACS scrambles to pick-up the photocopies.

<b>          110 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 110

          HANNA and SOPHIE are still standing at the railings. SOPHIE

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          Would you like some?

</b>          Can you help me get home?
          At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA
          rolls across the deck and catches on the railings.
          HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and quickly
          pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she
          shouldn't have let herself be so exposed.

          MILES is sitting in the driver's seat, pretending to drive
          the stationary van.
          Through the windscreen, RACHEL and SEB can be seen having a
          heated discussion.
          In the back, HANNA is changing into some of SOPHIE'S clothes.

</b>          Of course you are. You've got

          always wanted to be tall. If I were

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          I'm not a man.
          SOPHIE laughs even more.
          The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL,
          nervous but determined.

          as soon as we get off this crate.
          But since you don't have a passport
          with you right now, we're just
          going to have to be a bit gorilla.
          Okay?

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          We passionately believe it's the

          They don't look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round
          HANNA and HANNA returns the gesture, everybody slightly
          embarrassed.

          Cars are revving up, manoeuvring and getting ready to

          RACHEL is at the drivers wheel while SEB is in the back
          stripping the cushions from the bench seats to prepare a
          place for HANNA to hide.
          HANNA waits, breath bated, her arm round SOPHIE's shoulders.
          On the far side she sees ISAACS enter the deck. She watches
          him carefully and decides he must be looking for her. She
          ducks down a little further.
          RACHEL, looking nervous, turns to HANNA.

          ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry
          gates are open and the noise subsides.
          SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it.

<b>                         SEB
</b>          Oh Jesus.

          cushions aside and gets into the compartment.

          He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions
          just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around.
          SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He
          passes ISAACS on his way round.

<b>          SEB (CONT'D)
</b>          Excuse me. Sir?
          ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front
          passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her
          mirrors.
          SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea
          who he is.

<b>          INSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT -

          Dark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast.
          A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the
          deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with
          the exertion. Water dripping from his body.
          He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He
          approaches the beach car park.
          A POLICE CAR swings into the car park.
          ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on
          him.
          He stops and turns towards the police car.

          HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and
          brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a
          little water spills down his front.
          SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE

          CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a
          shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage,
          borders and rules. Families come here from cities across
          Europe and bring their whole lives with them.
          The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family
          walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious
          looking FRENCH family with quad bikes.
          SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment.

</b>          Jah, gut, gut...
          A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them.

<b>          FRENCH CAMPER.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          Ca va. Oui. Bien...
          HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's
          tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties
          complicated knots.
          RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.

          when we've put the tent up.

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          No thanks.
          HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a
          couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight.

          HANNA turns a display unit of postcards.
          Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGE

<b>          BOYS.
</b>          One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he
          passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome. HANNA'S
          not used to this feeling of being looked at.
          While the SHOP ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a
          postcard and a book of stamps.

          HANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard:

          HANNA gets up and posts the card.

          RACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          I just feel connected when I'm in
          the countryside. The city stifles
          me... emotionally, creatively.
          HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in
          the undergrowth.

<b>          RACHEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyway, I was very young when I...

          HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.

          HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS.
          She lays them in front of the family.

</b>          Food.
          SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and
          RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might
          be.

          more digits than I've got right
          now. Loads. Loads and loads.
          HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She
          licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't
          look right on her.

<b>                         HANNA

          SOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move
          secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of
          SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited,
          SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          I can't walk in this.

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          Says who?
          SOPHIE heads off down the road.
          HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to
          catch up with SOPHIE.

<b>          128 EXT. RAVE AT ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE. NIGHT. 128
</b>
          A loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre.
          SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking
          down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the
          abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and
          electric atmosphere - HANNA is thrilled and startled.
          Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA
          stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's
          forced to mime and shout her order over the music.

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          Vodka. Two.

          water.

<b>                         BARTENDER
</b>          Water only. No booze.
          Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY
          from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is
          staring at her again.
          SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to

<b>          HANNA.
</b>
<b>                         HANNA

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          Banging.
          HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it -
          SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music.
          HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They
          split up and start to survey the crowd.
          Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking
          place.
          ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER,
          thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway.

<b>                         ISAACS
</b>          What you got?

<b>                         DEALER

<b>                         SUBTITLES)
</b>          Nothing man. That guys just a
          friend.
          ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER
          against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash
          of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white
          powder.
          ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple
          of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops.

<b>                         SPANISH BOY

<b>                         SUBTITLES)
</b>          Where are you from?
          The girls just look at each other.

<b>          SPANISH BOY (CONT'D)
</b>          English? American? You like to
          party?
          They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and
          leads HANNA away.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          Will you teach me to do dancing?

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          It's easy.
          HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to
          dance.
          HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her
          arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a
          field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and
          expressive.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies
          around him greedily.
          He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his
          gums.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing.
          FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND.
          THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating
          their way in.

<b>          SOPHIE (CONT'D)

          FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking
          either.

<b>          FELICIANO'S FRIEND

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          So do you.
          HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact.
          The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent
          flashes of a strobe light.
          HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their
          movements caught in still flashes.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA. He smiles and
          starts to move through the crowds towards her.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA sees this and
          laughs.
          The crowd is jumping.
          HANNA feels FELICIANO'S hand take hers, she flinches a
          moment, then lets him draw her towards him. Their eyes still
          locked.
          ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the
          strobe lighting.
          HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of their own.
          His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck.
          He draws her face towards his.

<b>                         FELICIANO
</b>          Would you like to?

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          Kissing requires a total of thirty-
          four facial muscles.
          Their lips are almost touching.

<b>          HANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          The most important muscle involved
          is the orbicularis oris muscle,
          which is used to pucker the lips -
          He kisses her.
          HANNA closes her eyes.
          ISAACS moves in.
          FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her
          waist, she doesn't like it. He tries to open her mouth with
          his.
          HANNA snaps.
          In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws
          him to the ground. She falls to his side and, with one knee
          on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck.
          SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the
          closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare.
          ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe distance.

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          Hanna! Holy crap...

<b>                         FELICIANO
</b>          Please, don't hurt me.

<b>                         (TO SOPHIE)
</b>          Please, tell your friend...
          HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that she has FELICIANO on the
          ground she doesn't know what to do with him.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          Should I let him go?

<b>                         SOPHIE
</b>          As opposed to what? Yes, you should
          let him go.
          HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear.

</b>          Sure.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          It was nice.
          And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd.
          ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls
          among the mass of dancing bodies.
          HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the
          exit.

          A well-dressed woman in her 60's, KATRIN, is sitting alone
          listening to music on an old casette machine.
          The door buzzer rings. KATRIN gets up slowly and approaches
          the door.

          opens it a small amount.

          KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it.
          Fear racing through her veins, she rushes her way through the

          RACHEL is driving, while HANNA rides in the front seat
          keeping her entertained.

</b>          ...they can live at freezing
          temperatures for up to nine months
          without food. Imagine that, nine
          months.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Why do you know so much about
          fleas?

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          I read it in my Encyclopaedia.
          HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW
          and frowns, she's seen it before.

<b>          HANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          Also, they can jump around 200
          times their own body length, which
          makes them the best jumpers of all
          known animals except for the
          froghopper. Now they can really
          jump.
          RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror
          again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Everything all right?

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          I think so.
          But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.

<b>          JOANNA (V.O.)
</b>          Mama, I know you're disappointed in
          me, I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama.
          But I have found maybe a way to
          make it better...

          tapes MARISSA discovered at KATRIN ZADEK'S.

          In an adjoining bathroom MARISSA, in a pair of cotton
          pyjamas, is brushing her teeth. Her lips pulled back in a
          snarl.

</b>          An American program. It's very

          A phone booth in a city park. ERIK shivering in the cold as
          icy rain falls around him, he's holding the CELLPHONE he
          stole from the dead SPECIAL OPS. HELLER'S leg is bleeding
          profusely.

<b>          JOANNA (V.O.)

          HANNA sits beside her in the passenger seat, her anxiety

          RACHEL is still at the wheel, watching the bright headlights
          behind.

</b>          Shit. Shit, shit, shit. I think

          HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW.
          She's knows that whoever is driving that car is after her.
          She looks back and sees SEB, SOPHIE and MILES all comfortably
          asleep. MILES' fingers wrapped around a Transformers toy.

          The van slowly pulls in at the side of the road.
          RACHEL waits for the BMW behind to pass but instead it pulls
          in behind the van.
          On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The
          containers are piled on top of each other like a giant baby's
          building blocks.

          everything I could to get out of

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          I think you should stay where you
          are, Sophie.
          HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the
          silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and
          neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make
          the first move.

</b>          I'm sorry. But you really mustn't
          get out of the van.
          HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to

          HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car
          doors open.
          In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts
          from the van.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Hanna!
          RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA.
          The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his
          gun at her head. RACHEL screams.

<b>          148 EXT. CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 148
</b>
          HANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative
          safety of the container park.
          ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed.
          HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers.
          ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He
          signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA.
          HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way
          and that.
          ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze.

<b>          ISAACS (O.S.)
</b>          Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You
          need to come with me now. I know

<b>                         CUT TO:

          kicks him in the chest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          78.
</b>          HANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and
          scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the
          containers when she reaches a gap.
          The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too.
          A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up
          higher, now four containers high.
          ISAACS follow below.
          HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right
          over the head of ISAACS.
          HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the
          containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then
          pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to
          land on a lower container on the other side.
          HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the
          HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench
          and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the
          head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground.
          She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to
          the ground.
          She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the
          containers. She stops at a â€˜T' junction, unsure which way to
          go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN
          ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the
          third.
          She's trapped.

<b>          ISAACS (CONT'D)
</b>          Just take it easy.
          HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS.
          He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her.
          She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he
          crashes to the ground.
          She rolls and springs to her feet.
          The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick.

<b>          149 EXT. SCRAP METAL YARD/CANAL - NIGHT 149

          HANNA sprints full tilt out of the container park and through
          a scrap metal yard. Either side of her rise mountains of
          waste.
          HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the
          scrap metal is unloaded.

          HANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from
          an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel
          works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise.
          HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal
          playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge
          fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and
          abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by
          a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous
          angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE.
          The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme â€˜Fun House'.
          It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its
          roof.
          HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She
          walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and
          knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there
          being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and
          peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of

          The sound of KNEPFLER being escorted into a next-door room,
          the door shutting. The sound of footsteps coming into the
          room. HANNA silent under the bed. MARISSA'S GREEN SHOES are
          in sight, nothing else.
          The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress
          compress as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes
          as she hears her call.

</b>          Lewis. It's Marissa.
          HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she
          had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.

          HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the
          room. Male. ISAACS.

          control her breath.

          He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she
          hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under
          the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe.
          MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door.
          They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid-
          air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes.
          Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a
          window.

          He suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass

          the house.
          HELLER watches for a moment or two.
          Then, keeping low, he makes a painful run towards the house.
          HELLER throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen.
          He breathes heavily for a moment, clutching his wounded leg.
          He turns and rises to look through the kitchen window.
          Inside he sees KNEPFLER, stripped to the waist his body
          bloodied, hanging upside down from a meat hook. He's
          obviously dead.

          HANNA deletes the page. Sits in shock. Then writes in her
          mother's name. JOHANNA ZADEK.
          Immediately the article about JOHANNA's death comes up. HANNA
          stares at it. She reads it. No mention of a child. There is
          an address for Johanna Zadek. She came from the Heizinger

          HANNA looks at the thousands of tiny windows, so many lives

          Sees a name scrawled on one - Number 14. Zadek.
          She presses the buzzer. Waits. No answer.
          A GANG OF KURDISH YOUTHS come out the block and HANNA catches

          HANNA knocks at the door of number 14, waits, knocks again,
          louder. No reply.
          A door further along opens. Kurdish music pours out. A
          KURDISH WOMAN wrapped in shawls emerges pushing a pram. She's
          followed by her two other CHILDREN.

          HANNA climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen. The
          air is thick with the buzz of Bluebottle flies.
          HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA. With some trepidation
          she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of KATRIN
          ZADEK. The back of KATRIN'S head is blown clean away. The
          flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain
          that spreads across the cheap lino floor.
          HANNA steps back and gags.
          She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and
          goes through into the lounge.
          The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving
          pulled down. HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by
          MARISSA'S hunt for information.
          HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a
          tiny second bedroom. She stops and enters.
          The room had been turned into a home office, there are
          newspaper clippings relating to JOANNA'S MURDER and
          photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall
          space. A testament to KATRIN'S unremitting search for the
          truth behind her daughters murder.
          HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will
          help her understand who she is and where she came from.
          Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice.

</b>          I recruited your mother at an
          abortion clinic in May 1994. She
          was about to terminate an unwanted
          pregnancy. Some boy at a disco.
          HANNA looks at the paper in shock.

<b>          ERIK (CONT'D)
</b>          I had recruited twenty women. She
          was the last. She was different.

          to get some air. She is reeling - faint.

          repulsion.

          She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes
          her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener.

<b>          ERIK (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't.
          She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight
          in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps
          and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just defending
          himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers
          him, has a knife to his throat.

<b>                         HANNA

          He releases her. She goes to the door.

<b>                         ERIK

<b>                         HANNA

          And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK
          knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down
          the fire escape. ERIK calls after her.

          He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars
          coming across the estate scrubland.
          ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs
          through the destroyed living room, and out through the front
          door.

          away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars

          HELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible
          athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers
          for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa. Looking
          to finish it off.
          Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the
          end of the street. HELLER fires in their direction, starts to
          run down an alley. He vaults a dividing wall, scratching
          himself on barbed wire. He sprints round a corner and sees a
          doorway ahead of him. He walks towards the doorway.

          drops his gun.

          CLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away.
          She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means.
          An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing
          stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent.
          Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her
          over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto-

          bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers stare
          at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in her
          pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the letter Erik
          showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the address.
          Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland.
          HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was

          HANNA's head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the
          train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted,
          many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. Needing
          resolution.
          In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her
          child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The

          HANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the
          filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV.
          Cartoons. Tom and Jerry type stuff. But she doesn't laugh.
          She flicks channel. Then stands dead still. She is looking at
          ERIK HELLER's dead body on the ground. The report depicts him
          as a dangerous criminal. HANNA stares at the image. The death
          of the man she spent her life with. Lost forever. HANNA's
          face oddly still in the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off.
          Leaves the room.

          HANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the
          shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty
          room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard-
          drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she
          goes to the bar. A forty-five year old BUSINESSMAN stands
          there, drinking.

</b>          You don't like talk, huh?
          He barges into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on
          to the bed. He is strong. His words and tone contrasting
          violently with his actions.

          her head and smashes him against a cupboard. BUSINESSMAN
          grabs her hair and throws her on the bed.
          But now HANNA snaps. She starts to roar. It's like an animal,
          like nothing we have seen before. She rips at his face, grabs
          a glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it. Pure animal
          rage. BUSINESSMAN starts to scream, blood pouring from his
          eyes. He collapses on the floor. She kicks him, punches him,
          repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until she is spent of her
          primal fury and falls, panting, to the floor.

          run, faster and faster, just running to run out of herself.
          Finally she stops and is sick. She looks up. A taxi's yellow
          light blinks in the darkness. She looks at the businessman's
          wallet to see how much money is in there. She approaches the

          road through undulating snow-covered hills. Cold dawn is
          arriving. Grey skies lightening through the windscreen. Tall
          snowy pines tower above the car. No one else on the road,
          just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture. It is as if
          from a different age. Quiet, solitary. HANNA checks the
          paper in her pocket. Still there. Blood on her hands from the
          businessman. A cut in her arm. Carefully, secretly, she wipes
          it clean.
          Suddenly the taxi stops.

          fast. Blows icy air in her face.
          She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead.
          It's hilly, winding, she isn't going to make it. Too tired.

          HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on.
          Carries on walking.
          Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can she
          make it?
          Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, almost
          magically, the car slows and stops. The window winds down.

<b>          HANNA (CONT'D)

          me?
          A woman's voice, German, in German.

<b>          WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          Yes I can take you there.
          And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling
          face of MARISSA WIEGLER.

          MARISSA starts to drive, HANNA sits in the front with her.
          HANNA has no idea who she is.
          MARISSA speaks in perfect German. Calm, soft, comforting.

<b>                         MARISSA

          MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.

</b>          That's right. I lived there for
          many years. I travel a lot.
          MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first
          time in ages. She feels the tears come.

          HANNA nods. She fights the tears.
          MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping.

<b>          MARISSA (CONT'D)

          MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the

          this road.
          HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has
          slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the
          window. She is asleep. Vulnerable.

          MARISSA looks at the sleeping HANNA. MARISSA represses her
          gathering emotion. HANNA suddenly looking so young as she
          sleeps the sleep of the innocent. The rush of emotion shocks
          her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers
          off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree. She
          puts her foot sharply on the brake. She's wearing the same
          GREEN SHOES as she wore at Wilhelm's House.
          HANNA is jolted awake.

<b>                         HANNA

          MARISSA calms herself instantly.

</b>          Nearly there.
          HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES.

<b>          194 EXT. GALINKA 194

          MARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet.

<b>          195 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. 195

          HANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is
          confused.

          HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          Thank you for the ride. You're very

<b>                         MARISSA
</b>          I wish there was more I could do
          for you.
          MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the
          intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and
          retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA.

<b>          MARISSA (CONT'D)
</b>          Here, take this.
          HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking.

<b>          MARISSA (CONT'D)
</b>          I hope you find what you're looking
          for.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          Thank you.
          She gets out and shuts the door behind her.

<b>          196 EXT. GALINKA. CONT. 196

          HANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the
          ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then
          drives off.
          HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not
          used for many years.
          She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance
          there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the
          old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a
          long time.
          She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then
          she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the
          spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and,
          exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up
          the narrow tree-lined driveway.

          HANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker.
          She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it
          on and walks into the darkness.

<b>          198 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 198
</b>
          With only the torch light to see by HANNA treads warily
          deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of
          daylight recedes slowly to nothing.
          The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her.
          HANNA reaches a junction where four tunnels meet. She shines
          her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go.
          She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the
          tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe.
          HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red
          shoe, its buckle rusted.
          She walks on into the dark.
          HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff,
          but HANNA uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of
          a gap to squeeze through.

<b>          199 INT. NURSERY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 199
</b>
          At first HANNA has difficulty making out where she is, but
          dotted here and there are parts of an old nursery. The walls
          are painted with a blue sky, clouds and the figures of
          children holding hands.
          She begins to remember as, from a distant place, she hears
          the sound of children laughing. She shines her torch in the
          direction of the laughter and catches a glimpse of a child,
          dressed in a party frock and hat, playing hide and seek. She
          shines her torch the other way, and there's another, then a
          third and a fourth. For a moment the room seems to be filled
          with laughing children.
          Then, in an instant, they're gone again and silence returns.
          HANNA, lit only be the reflected light of her torch, knows
          she has been here before.
          She walks on through the tunnels.

<b>          200 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 200

          HANNA enters a long hall which was once the children's

</b>          At one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames.
          From a distant place in her memory HANNA begins to hear the
          sound of children singing.

<b>                         CHILDREN
</b>          Happy Birthday to you,
          Happy Birthday to you...
          From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of
          CHILDREN, the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake
          lit with birthday candles. The children's faces glow eerily
          in the candle light. They're looking at HANNA and walking
          straight towards her as they sing.

<b>          CHILDREN (CONT'D)
</b>          Happy Biirrrrthday, dear...
          The CHILDREN arrive at HANNA lifting the cake towards her.

<b>          CHILDREN (CONT'D)
</b>          ... Hanna.
          Happy Birthday to you!
          HANNA leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows. The
          children disappear with the flames of the candles.
          The sound of a woman's approaching footsteps echo through the
          tunnel.
          HANNA swings her torch beam in the direction of the
          footsteps. She freezes as she sees a pair of GREEN SHOES
          walking towards her. The same shoes as in Wilhelm's house.

<b>          MARISSA WIEGLER.
</b>          HANNA raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from
          the car.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          You're Marissa Wiegler.
          HANNA starts to shake.
          MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is
          the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence.
          HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English.

<b>                         MARISSA
</b>          Don't worry sweetie. I don't want
          to hurt you.
          MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of
          maternal care.
          HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.

          HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN, three of them, all
          with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot her should she attack
          or run. They are some distance away, not coming any closer.

          hard not to succumb.

          and runs into the shadows.

          HANNA running through the darkness. Behind her ISAACS and the
          HENCHMEN come after her. ISAACS carries a large heavy torch,
          as does one of the HENCHMEN. The other HENCHMEN all have
          night vision on their rifles.
          HANNA crouches down, she sniffs the air, can smell them
          coming.
          A HENCHMAN treads carefully down the tunnel. We see his point
          of view through his night vision sight, just the dark tunnel
          stretching on.
          Like a ghost HANNA'S face appears up close, her eyes a pearly
          white.
          She slams the gun back in the HENCHMAN'S face.
          Still in night vision we see the fight, quick and hard. The
          flash of a single bullet illuminates his death.
          Silence once more.
          HANNA now has the first HENCHMAN'S rifle.
          From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the
          sound of feet on dirt. She presses herself against the
          tunnel, waits listening, hears the feet again and in one
          movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner.
          Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared eyes
          staring back at her.
          She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers
          into the darkness.

<b>          202 INT. LABORATORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 202

          HANNA comes into the old laboratory. Through her night vision
          sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment.
          She senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab
          bench.
          A HENCHMAN enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small
          torch. His footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps
          through the broken glass that litters the floor.
          HANNA rises from her hiding place and stands straight into

          left arm.
          He drops his torch which slides across the floor.
          HANNA comes round the lab bench to where the HENCHMAN should
          be lying but he's gone. There's a trail of blood which she
          follows to a metal cabinet.
          She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its
          flimsy doors.
          The dead HENCHMAN slides out from the cabinet.
          HANNA takes the dead man's hand gun and goes to retrieve the
          torch.
          She switches the torch off.

          ISAACS, unnerved, presses himself against the wall of the
          tunnel. He feels something at his legs. Points his torch to
          find the deer pulling at his trouser leg. He shoots it. Then
          runs further down into the tunnel.
          Alerted by the sound of ISAACS' shot HANNA starts to pursue
          her prey.

<b>          204 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA. 204
</b>
          ISAACS is back in the dormitory. With torch in hand he
          searches under the beds. Behind him he hears HANNA enter. He
          switches off his torch and crawls under a bed.
          HANNA walks slowly between the beds. Under the bed ISAACS is
          preparing to fire, now watching her feet.
          Suddenly the bed he's under is lifted straight up in the air
          and off him - HANNA has summoned enormous strength and is
          clutching the end of the bed. He fires, hits nothing and she
          lets go - the bed comes crashing down on him again.
          His torch rolls away. His arms are trapped under the bed,
          he's unable to move.
          With all his might ISAACS pushes at the bed and lifts it off
          himself.
          They fight.
          HANNA picks up the torch and slams the torch across his
          temple. She grabs him by the hair and smashes his head
          repeatedly into the floor - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM.
          Silence - he's dead.

</b>          HANNA sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands -
          looks down at what she's done. Shocked by her own violence
          she begins to cry hot tears of bewilderment.
          She gets up and runs from the dormitory.

          HANNA runs back through the tunnels.

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          No more. No more.
          Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the
          tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond. Standing in silhouette
          is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and stops when she can see
          the white of MARISSA'S eyes and the finger on MARISSA'S
          trigger.
          MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes
          forward again, walking calmly towards her.
          She stops and drops her gun to the ground.

<b>          HANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          Everything I see is nothing I want.
          MARISSA looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance.
          She smiles.

<b>                         MARISSA
</b>          Let me take care of you?

<b>                         HANNA
</b>          No. I don't want that.
          HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the
          opposite direction.
          MARISSA watches her walk away.
          HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.

</b>          A wide shot of the HANNA'S cabin, wisps of smoke rise from
          it's chimney.
          HANNA steps out of the cabin. She's back wearing her furs
          again. In her hands she carries a cup of hot milk and a small
          wooden bowl.
          In VOICE-OVER we hear HANNA reading from her beloved
          Encyclopaedia.

          the Sun, and the fifth-largest of
          the eight planets in the Solar
          System.
          HANNA sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours
          some milk into the bowl, then drinks a little for herself.

<b>          HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          known to exist.
          She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her
          friend, the snow fox, appears from the trees. The fox now has
          a small family of cubs.
          HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to
          drink.

          HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face. Above her
          the trees are beginning to leaf.
