          Tell me about Reggie Campo.

<b>                         MICK
</b>          You didn't tell me. That you were
          going to pay her for sex.
          (off Louis's surprise)
          You think it's hard to find out

</b>          Alright I will. You know that guy
          on the Venice boardwalk? The one
          who has all those plates spinning
          on sticks?

</b>          Just listen. A bunch of spinning
          plates: that's the state's case. In
          the middle is a big one. It's a
          fucking platter. And if that falls
          it takes the others down with it.
          (He gets closer to Louis)
          The big plate is the victim. The
          only witness against you. I knock
          her down, the act is over and the
          crowd goes home. No trial.
          Mick has Louis' attention now.

<b>                         LOUIS
</b>          You can make this trial go away?

<b>                         MICK
</b>          We've lost time. You concealed from
          me the fact that could do it. It
          comes down to why.

<b>                         LOUIS
</b>          Why what?

<b>                         MICK
</b>          Why would a guy with a Porsche and
          a Rolex need a knife to get sex
          from a woman who sells it anyway?
          The answer is, he wouldn't. And
          when you see that you see the set-
          up, the trap. And suddenly it's the
          defendant who looks like the
          victim.
          Louis gets it. Penitent.

<b>                         MICK
</b>          Yes. Young hot-shot named Ted
          Minton. He wants to give me the
          discovery file. Poor guy doesn't
          know that Raul already got it. He's
          new to felonies but he's no dope.
          When he hears his vic's a hooker
          he'll know we've knocked all his
          plates down.

</b>          No promises, Louis.
          Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect. Then sees Mick to
          the door. When he opens it: MARY WINDSOR's there. Surprised
          to see Haller.

          Louis hurries over, as far from the clubhouse as possible, in
          order not to be seen or heard-- eager--

<b>                         LOUIS

          said it would be over by now--

          He shoves a sheet at Louis. Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
          but DIFFERENT from the knife-picture we saw before.

</b>          You know what that is? It's a
          picture of your knife. The one you
          had on you when you went to Reggie
          Campos. The one the cops have.
          Look at the blood on the blade.
          Look at the initials.
          Louis is stuck for an answer--

<b>                         MICK (CONT'D)
</b>          That's why Ted Minton didn't care
          when I told him Reggie's a
          prostitute. What's it matter, when
          he's got a knife with her blood and
          your initials on it?

</b>          (scowls, sore)
          That's right. The file Raul got us
          was a loaded deck. The cops must
          have been on to him, because they
          used it to set us up. So we'd think
          they had nothing, when in fact they
          had enough to put your Hugo Boss,
          golf-playing ass away for twenty
          years!
          Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off.
          He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis.
          Mick sees him looking her way...
          Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A
          moment... then Mick resumes. Cold and firm.

<b>          INT. DINER (DUPAR'S) - MORNING - MICK AT THE COUNTER:

          Unshaven. Edward Hopper drabness. To lose himself in work,
          looks down at his files:
          An 8x10 OF REGGIE CAMPO'S BATTERED FACE.
          WAITRESS, 50s, pours coffee. Recoils as she glimpses the
          picture, the gruesome wounds, Mick didn't mean her to see.

</b>          I just hope you catch the bastard
          who did it to her.
          And goes. Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide
          it-- but finds that he's only hid it halfway. Leaving half
          her face exposed. The good half. Something about this... He
          picks it up again, folds it...

<b>          INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Leaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against
          the mirror, the unhurt left side showing. Creates a full
          image of a face. He stares a long time. Then, to himself:

           "fleet." California plates: NT GLTY 1, NT GLTY 3, NT GLTY
          4.. Walks past... to some battered file cabinets. He turns
          on a single-bulb lamp...
          DRAWER OPENING ON FILE CABINET... Mick's fingers fly through
          the tabs of old files, stops at: MARTINEZ.
          Cut to, MARTINEZ FILES ON DESK, MOMENTS LATER: Mick examines
          them: Police reports, printouts. Until he finds...
          Autopsy report. Name: RENTERIA, MARIA. Takes out... Bx10
          PHOTO: WOMAN DEAD ON A BED, NAKED. Dark bloodstains.
          NEXT PHOTO - TIGHTER: Knife-wounds. And bruises.
          NEXT PHOTO - HER FACE: BEATEN: Injuries to the left side
          (opposite of Reggie's.) Dark-haired, large brown eyes.
          MICK. Folds this one in half. Takes the folded shot of
          Reggie, fits them together, crease to crease: So alike, they
          form what could be the face of one woman.
          Mick. Not wanting to face the memory: a VOICE in his head:

          to do with it? If the murder was
          some kind of gay thing, why'd they
          ransack the office? Isn't it

          can be good for us... Don't know

          remember that anyone, anyone, can
          be the victim of a violent crime.
          (approaches the jury box)
          The case is clear. Straightforward.
          A man attacked a woman in her home
          in order to rape and kill her.

          Mary would insist, but before she can, OUT OF THE ELEVATOR
          comes KURLEN-- with LANKFORD AND SOBEL. Mick freezes, expects
          the worst-- but they move AROUND him and CLOSE IN ON:

<b>                         KURLEN
</b>          Louis Roulet, you are under arrest.
          Turn around and place your hands

          Mick? This shouldn't be happening.
          Mrs. Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back--

          Martha Renteria.

<b>                         DOBBS
</b>          That snake-dancer nonsense? Are you
          crazy? Everything that man Corliss
          said was a lie!
          Which stops Kurlen. He grins, confirmed.

<b>                         KURLEN
</b>          If it was all lies, how'd you know
          I meant the snake dancer?
          Dobbs sees his mistake. Kurlen begins again to take Louis--

<b>                         MICK
</b>          A moment with my client, Detective?
          Kurlen nods, why not. Mick leads Louis a few steps away.

<b>                         MICK (CONT'D)
</b>          This is it, Louis. I got you off.
          Now get yourself a new lawyer.

</b>          Yeah, and you'll have to explain

          But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists...

<b>                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Because I don't think they have

</b>          You've reached the cell-phone of
          Maggie McPherson...

<b>                         MICK
</b>
<b>          DAMMIT!
</b>          Slams down the phone... Desperate, grabs his jacket, his gun,
          flies towards the front door...
          OPENS it-- and MARY WINDSOR stands there. Before he speaks--
          She raises her hand and SHOOTS him. BRIGHT FLASH--
          Nick's POV, Woozy-- he falls back, she raises her gun again--

<b>                         MARY WINDSOR
</b>          You took my son away from me!
          She raises her gun again-- Mick FIRES AT HER FROM INSIDE THE
          JACKET. Her body jerks back, she falls...
          Mick, stunned, lies there...
          He watches, through the haze of his condition, as Mary
          Windsor's fallen body jerks, on the floor... CUT TO,

<b>          EXT. LOUIS ROULET'S PORSCHE (MOVING) --

<b>          TURNS ONTO DICKENS...
</b>
<b>          INT. PORSCHE --LOUIS...
</b>
          Hate contorting his features, he's checking out the street
          numbers through the DOWNWARD SLASH OF RAIN... WHEN...
          The ROAD SAINTS, MOTORCYCLES SPANNING THE STREET, ARE HEADING

<b>          RIGHT FOR HIM...
</b>          Off Louis, his confusion and dawning fear... Cut to,

<b>          EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - OUT OF THE SCHOOLBUS...
</b>
          Out steps Hayley, safe into Maggie's arms. Sitter looks on as
          Maggie hugs her... WHILE...

<b>          INT. MICK'S HOUSE - MICK LIES ON THE FLOOR...
</b>
          Where he was shot. He's alert but still...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          130.
</b>          Then rouses more as he HEARS feet come up the front steps...

<b>                         WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>
<b>          POLICE! PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!
</b>
<b>                         MICK
</b>          (forces out the words)
          They're down! I'm shot!
          Suddenly LANKFORD & SOBEL are through the door-- Lankford
          sees Mary on the floor, while--

<b>                         SOBEL
</b>          Don't move, Haller--
          She rushes to him. Lankford's already on his phone--

<b>                         LANKFORD
</b>          This is Lankford, we've got a
          shooting, twelve-twelve Creek off
          Laurel, we need paramedics,
          ambulance transport for two--
          During which he's checking Mary Windsor's body, revises--

<b>                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          Transport for one.
          Rings off. Sobel takes Mick's hand, presses it to his wound--

<b>                         SOBEL
</b>          Press hard and keep pressing.
          Mick's hand is on a blood-soaked hole, hurting like hell...
          while Lankford makes another call...

<b>                         LANKFORD
</b>          Yeah, it's Lankford again. Tell
          them it's over, they can grab
          Roulet and bring him in... He what?

<b>                         (LISTENS-- SURPRISED)
</b>          So, bring him to the Emergency Room
          first, then bring him in!
          (rings off; to Sobel)
          Dig this. The uniforms had some
          help picking up Roulet. Some
          motorcycle gang was already beating
          the shit out of him.

<b>                         MICK
</b>          (figures it out--)
          The police were tailing him?

<b>                         SOBEL
</b>          (She levels.)
          We thought he'd come after you. We
          couldn't tell you. The truth is we
          had plenty on him for killing
          Renteria. Jesus Martinez will be
          released. But we wanted Roulet for
          Levin, too. I told you: We had to
          find out how he beat the trace. Now
          we know.
          (her glance goes to Mary

<b>                         WINDSOR)
</b>          It was almost perfect. He's still
          wearing the anklet...

<b>                         MICK
</b>          I know...

<b>                         SOBEL
</b>          And it puts him half a city away.
          Just like last time.
          They share a look at the cleverness of it. When--

<b>                         LANKFORD
</b>          Look at this.
          Mick looks, HIS WOOZY POV AGAIN: Lankford, wearing a glove,
          lifts Mary's gun. Pearl-handled: The WOODSMAN. Admiring--

<b>                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          They don't make'm like this
          anymore.
          Mick, makes a shape with his free hand. The "Longhorns" sign:
          inner fingers pointing down. Like Raul made.

<b>                         MICK
</b>          "W." Mrs. Windsor.
          Which is the last thing he manages to say before blanking.

<b>          FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>          FADE IN, EXT. HAYLEY, CLIMBING A TREE - DAY OF BLUE SKY
</b>
          L.A.'s best weather: Smog-blue. The tree off Mick's porch.
          Hayley's skinny legs climb nimbly from branch to branch.
          From the angle, we can tell someone is watching her.

<b>          FADE OUT.
</b>

<b>          FADE IN AGAIN, ANGLE, HAYLEY ON THE NEXT BRANCH, LATER
</b>          Lifts herself. Nimble. And so pretty. Watching is:

<b>          MICK - ON THE PORCH - WRAPPED UP IN A LOUNGE CHAIR
</b>          Recovering, but not fully there. MAGGIE SITS INTO FRAME
          beside him.

<b>                         MAGGIE
</b>          I didn't know you were awake.
          He looks at her. Questioning.

<b>                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't worry, we haven't been living
          here. We did, for a while. When you
          were touch and go.
          Mick. Returns his gaze to-- HAYLEY, going branch to branch.

<b>                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'd better get her down, she can
          get hurt up there--

<b>                         MICK
</b>          You can get hurt anywhere. Let her
          climb.
          An almost normal tone of voice. She smiles. CUT TO,
