<b>          
</b>          A mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint
          where a RWANDAN POLICEMAN blows his whistle, waves some and stops
          others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on.
<b>          
</b>          CLOSE ON: A white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line
          jumping. HORNS, OBSCENITIES.
<b>          
</b>          A HAND: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs
          pressed neatly between thumb and palm.

</b>          In the passenger seat PAUL RUSESABAGINA, late 30's, flashes a smile. He
          is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie,
          it is a matter of pride).
<b>          
</b>          A quick shake of hands. Money passes from one to the other.

</b>          Suddenly, Zozo slows.
<b>          
</b>          Paul looks up, SEES: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large
          crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts.
          They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia.

</b>          (Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly
          colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road,
          obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a
          rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music
          from a boombox.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.

</b>          The van pulls up beside the Militia.

</b>          Paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars.

          Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso.
<b>          
</b>          Behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded

</b>          The driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the
          crate but it slides off and CRASHES onto the floor: MACHETES, hundreds
          of them, spill out.
<b>

</b>          THE INTERAHAMWE PARADE - a mass of young men and women, most in the

                      favors. If I call to help Victor, a
                      General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is
                      a fool. He thinks my favors are so
                      numerous and so insignificant as to waste
                      them on everybody." Then my hard work is
                      doubly squandered. I insult the General
                      and I do not get to use my favor at all.
                      Please leave these things to my good
                      judgment.

                      accord between the Tutsi rebels and his

                      by the accords. But for now hope has
