</b>          I saw a severed head once. Except for the,
          paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed.
          The end came abruptly you could tell
          'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence.
          "Shh.  ," the curled lips attempted. Like
          it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley"
          or... "shit happens." Your eyes don't
          forget things like that. Like you don't
          forget the sound animals make when
          they're humping. Primal.
          Raw. They endure
          in you forever because the senses have a
          brain all their own and they recall long
          after you've succumbed to the la-la of
          forgetfulness.

          Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.

</b>          And it starts all over again.
          From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky.

           We are in the eye of a STORM, an angry mass of clo uds raging

          An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness.

          A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE
          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.
          It's a man.
          It's a man, plus.
          It's a SUPERHERO,
          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b
          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.
          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
          Disheveled. Worn. A face
          chiselled with mileage.

</b>          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the
          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.
          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
          down the street like loose change.
          The rain continues its onslaught.

<b>          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not
          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,
          dinner before them.
          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a
          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as
          low fat milk.
          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A
          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
          attitude.
          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK
          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn
          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.

<b>          MARY
</b>          The principal did'nothing. Like
          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
          being tardy. What's the matter with
          education? Back when, you could go to
          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...
          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the
          way home.

<b>          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b>
          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
          gait.
          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
          raped subway wall.
          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...

<b>          "YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
</b>          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
          Deposits it under his coat.
          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
          above.
          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...

</b>
          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open
          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes
          out of his clothes.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before
          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-
          the-face body.

           a He-man pose, his

           He removes the Police apparel,
           plastic. Proceeds to put it on.

</b>          His blood-shot eyes mean it.
          Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail.

<b>          FISH
</b>          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.
          (re: the check-in sheet)
          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.
          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          on the dotted line.
          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's
          grab.

<b>          FISH (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,
          and I don't know you from Jack. You want
          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.
          Plunger's extra.

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          I need quiet. Is it quiet?

<b>          FISH
</b>          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public
          library to you? The girls work. Some of
          them scream, some of them moan...

<b>          (SMILES)
</b>          and some of them just kinda lay there
          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls
          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.

          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
          under the window.

          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.

          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
          CLINKS off the counter.
          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.

</b>          He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt -
          complete with holster.

          Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured
          by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal.
          He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we
          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.
          A shoulder patch reads...

<b>          U-RENT SECURITY CO.
</b>          Their motto: "TO OBSERVE AND RECORD"
          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.

<b>          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story
          is rain.
          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty
          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.
          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's
          interpretation of a man's weapon.
          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.

<b>          HORUS
</b>          How's the eye?

<b>          AARON
</b>          Black.
          Horus enters.
          Stands awkwardly before his son.

<b>          HORUS
</b>          It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it
          up with some make-up and you won't even

<b>          AARON
</b>          Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly
          make-up on my face.
          Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.

          There'll always be people around
          who'll... exert force over those of us
          who just want to live in peace.
          Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.

<b>          HORUS (CONT' D)
</b>          (pain in every word)
          The thing to do is... to avoid them.
          They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the
          anger... and move on. You hold the anger.
          (turns to Aaron)
          I tell you because I can't take it,
          seeing you hurt. You're part of me.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          I've felt what you're feeling now. And if
          you've got any of me in you, you're gonna
          feel what I felt-when you go up against
          one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you
          do... the other cheek. You do that for
          me. No, you're not the coward. Not you.
          No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause
          I don't want to see you hurt. I love you.
          I ask you to do that for me... your old
          man.
          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark
          hallway - moved b y his affection.
          She oversees a father-son embrace.

<b>          HORUS (CONT'D)

          Tomorrow always feels better...

          The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the
          room.

          Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him
          from behind.
          It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.

           Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back.
          He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator.
           Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured

          An open door faces the MOANING TV set. It's the bathroom and
          it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock.
          He squats on the TOILET, pants around the ankles, cape shrouded
          around him.
          Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen, a cigarette
          dangling from the corner of his lip.
          We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
          a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy.

          It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway
          Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps

          A loaded beat.
          Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of

          scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages.
          in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With
          a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route
          to the windshield of a police vehicle outside.
          Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of

          We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a

          Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts

          the blonde kid from class.
          We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,

          The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with
          sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm.
          Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
          breasts beckoning at ceiling.
          Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the

          Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his

          He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of
          malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his
          uniform, his gun.
          They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security.

          We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
          hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
          water in Dixie cups.
          It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his

          Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
          above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
          We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
          peers into the alley.
          There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
          JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
          legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
          The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...

          Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
          legs.
          A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
          other's eyes for answers.
          The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
          it into the light.

          From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the
          side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing
          into the trash cans below.
          Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
          against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
          He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
          the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-
          up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic.
          He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than

          he can hear it, and then maybe not.

<b>          MARY (V.O.)

          They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just
          the brick wall and a trash can.
          They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler

          He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They

          That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
          hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
          In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them

          cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
          seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
          rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
          are closing in and they're going to tear
          him to pieces. So what does he think...
          "I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
          confront them and I'll get my ass
          butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
          "stay and least I'd have something, a

          together tightly.

<b>          MARY
</b>          (like a little girl)
          Let's see.

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          You have to be quick.

<b>          MARY
</b>          Come on, I want to see.

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          If you blink, you'll miss it.
          Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white
          something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into
          moisture. It showers into his open hands.
          Mary reaches for it. Too late.

<b>          MARY
</b>          I saw it, right? A little cloud.
          She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains.
          And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain.
          Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand
          touches his.
          He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
          her hand away.

<b>          MARY (CONY' D)
</b>          The water is dirty.

<b>          MARY
</b>          You should slow down. Rest.

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          -So people tell me.

<b>          MARY
</b>          (heat; upon some thought)
          It must be hard.

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          Hard?

<b>          MARY
</b>          To always do right... do good when all
          you want to do is rest.

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          It's harder to not do anything. What am
          I? It's not for me. It's for... it is
          about people. Rest? When there is
          despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am
          relief. You know that instant, that split
          instant of time when you realize that the
          nightmare... the totality of fear
          itself... that it's all been a bad dream?
          That it's safe? That is relief. The
          infant in my arms... to the hysterical
          mother. When you can see her face, what's
          rest? It is self-indulgence.
          Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          It's not important who I am, Mary. Or

          You probably get a lot of practice
          explaining yourself, on account of who
          you are and what you do.

          Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat.
          From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks
          relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he
          takes.

<b>          AARON

          Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
          metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
          they scale it.
          Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
          side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.

<b>          PERCEVAL
</b>          Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed

          Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their

          Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
          with clenched fists.

          And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing
          BLOWS to the face and body.
          Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,

          Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky.
          He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of
          recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon.
          He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
          into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
          fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag.
          Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
          ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.

          Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
          fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP,
          revenge presents itself.

          Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral
          orifice. Contemplates his target.
          Aaron - to pee or not to pee...
          ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.

<b>          AARON
</b>          (to the boys)

          Horus sleeps. Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush. She moves
          to the closet. Changes out of her clothes.
          Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
          watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet.
          Mary stands before the closet mirror. Does a profile check. She
          reaches for her bra... and from the mirror, catches Horus
          staring,.

          Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."

<b>          AARON (CONT' D)
</b>          Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I

          The Big Haircut. Mary and Hancock - up close. Mary runs her
          fingers through his hair, testing his length. She leans into
          him. SNIP, goes her scissor.
          Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in
          her presence. Baffled.
          From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her
          sweater.
          And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
          of their breaths.

          Hancock.
          Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
          he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.

          Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...

<b>          MARY
</b>          I started out just trimming for Horus.
          Here and there. He had to look just right
          for the academy, says his father, a
          police captain there... in Philly. When
          we moved here, I pretty much took over as
          the resident barber. You know, to save
          some money.

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          He was in the-police academy?
          A pause.

<b>          MARY
</b>          His father's idea. Not his. He went
          through it anyway, like he had something
          to prove... the validation of his
          manhood.

<b>          (BEAT)

          Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
          in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.

<b>          MARY
</b>          Yes.
          Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!

<b>          AARON
</b>          my mouth. It's starting to swell. I

</b>          All right. Go to your room. I'll get the

          Aaron exits. Mary exits.
          Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for

          The clock - 9:45 pm.
          The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side
          door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer.
          He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and
          peers out at the street - no Roheim.

<b>          INT. BAR - NIGHT
</b>
          The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there,
          marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis.
          She mingles with a BAR FLY.
          Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
          From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap.

          The warning comes across quite well - the man exits.
          Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
          bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.

<b>          GINA
</b>          (to bar fly)
          Meet you outside. The El Camino, right?
          The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
          in her hands, studies him.

<b>          GINA (CONT'D)
</b>          Your eyes are calm. It's good.
          She withdraws her hands.

          Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the

<b>          INT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT
</b>
          They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the
          light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face
          bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling.
          A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.

<b>          HORUS
</b>          Jesus.
          Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to

</b>          Why didn't you come through the back...
          standing out there in the dark?

<b>          ROHEIM

          pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach.

          foot in the door.

<b>          HORUS
</b>          No.

<b>          CLYDE
</b>          What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
          Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm
          a kamikaze move, indeed.

<b>          CLYDE (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>          (SHOCKED)

          Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's
          midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.

<b>          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the
          massacre commences.
          He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS
          across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if
          Horns accepted it as fate.

          By the fence - Mary and Aaron.
          Mary, with a brown paper BAG, seems.distant, preoccupied in a
          far away place.

<b>          AARON
</b>          Are you all right, mom?

          Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.

<b>          INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
          The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged,
          disoriented. He confronts an empty apartment.

<b>          HORUS
</b>          Mary!
          A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the
          apartment.

<b>          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY
</b>
          The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some
          muffled volume.
          Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a
          cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a
          while, one would suspect.

          In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF.

          follows suit, passing by.

           Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.

<b>          EXT..STREET - DAY
</b>
           Horus stumbles. Keeps his balance. Trudges down the street to a
          corner BAR.

<b>          INT. BAR - DAY
</b>
          The bar is empty at this hour. The chairs are up, the floor
          swept. A husky BARTENDER unloads liquor in the back.
          Horus enters. Finds a stool.

<b>          HORUS
</b>          Drink.
          The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.

          Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms.
          It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the
          clouds - they're alive, restless.
          She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.

<b>          HANCOCK

<b>          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
</b>          (at the clouds)
          They're moving. The turbulence has
          started.

<b>          MARY
</b>          Tell me what's wrong.
          He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
          darkness.

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          Look out there and what do you see, Mary?

<b>          MARY
</b>
<b>          (PERPLEXED)

          You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you.
          He'll say: "you do what you have to do."
          Or what? You let the next guy do it for
          you, if you don't... if you can't.

          Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's

<b>          HANCOCK
</b>          I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll

</b>          I want you to save me.

<b>          MARY
</b>          How?
          Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her.
          Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing
          her senses, pulls away.

          Aaron. The school hallway. He holds a wooden hall PASS,
          indicating that class is in session.
          He swings into the BOYS ROOM.

<b>          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY
</b>
          A large restroom - empty. Little Aaron passes up on the urinals.
          Selects a private STALL. ZIP - urination begins.
          Splash segues into drip. DRIP. Aaron shakes off the last drop...

<b>          PLOP.
</b>          And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles

          but, from behind, the stall door opens...
          Guess who?
          Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head.
          Introduces it to the yellowed waters below.
          SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the
          next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
          shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range.
          What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked
          laughter.

          Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a WHISKEY BOTTLE in
          his hand. He's been drinking. L"i
          in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
          upper branches of a tree.

          flick of the wrist... shoots it down.
          A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
          limp and lifeless. A THUD we hear on impact.

<b>          SUE (CONT'D)

          Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to...
          BAM... buildings. He strikes the corner of a brick tower,

          Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble.

          to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk.
          We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something
          stiff up his ass.

          in on Hancock.
          A machine GUN mounted inside opens FIRE - a wave of bullets
          ricochet off the superhero with no effect.
          Cops and S.W.A.T. teams continue their assault - it's the only
          thing they can do, and it's worthless.
          And on that note, Hancock retaliates - with a vengeance.
          First to go is the helicopter. He slices through the air and
          RIPS the vehicle in half.
          An EXPLOSION punctuates its demise - sending the spinning
          PROPELLER into wild trajectory. It crashes into a cluster of
          Cops - heads are severed, sent flying.

          Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building.
          From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble,
          heading towards the confrontation. He'passes a mutilated body -
          belonging to Adams.
          A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun
          and stops. He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes

          points it at his head...

           FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom
