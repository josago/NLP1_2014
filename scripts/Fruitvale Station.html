      Sophina doesn't answer. The phone rings again. Oscar's hand
      quickly picks it up and flips it open. We follow the phone to
      his face and we see him for the first time, a 22 year old
      Black man with a warm smile.

      He closes it before the guy on the other end can respond. He
      takes the phone with him as he climbs back into bed with
      SOPHINA MESA, a curvy 24 year old Mexican American woman.

      Sophina nods. Oscar moves closer to her and kisses her on her
      neck. She kisses him back a bit, then scoots away.                  

      Oscar kisses her again. Puts his hand in her hair.

      Oscar jumps up and grabs the bag of weed off of the dresser
      and hides it in the closet.

      He rushes over and opens the door where we see TATIANA GRANT,
      a cute 4 year old girl, standing wearing footie pajamas.

      bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger
      over his lips.

       She quickly sits up. Oscar leans over to give her a kiss on
       the cheek, makes a farting sound on her neck instead.

       Sophina chuckles at this as she gets out of the car.

       Oscar, now in the car by himself rides in the car listening
       to HIP HOP MUSIC. He comes to a red light.

       He looks at the car radio clock: 8:58 AM.

       He thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied. He
       turns his music up for a beat and listens to it. He looks
       around, still not at ease. He turns off his music and pulls
       out his cellphone. He takes a quick look around to see what
       cars are around, before dialing numbers. CALLING MOM flashes
       on the screen. He holds the phone to his ear.

        It is a moderately sized grocery store, but several SHOPPERS
        move about the aisles. Oscar walks over to the seafood
        section where Cato CALDWELL, a 22 year old charismatic Black       
        male stands behind the counter wearing a Deli apron.

        Cato sees Oscar and smiles brightly. He takes a pile of fish       
        off the scale, bags it, ands it to an older BLACK WOMAN. He
        takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with Oscar over the
        counter.

       We see Oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking
       through the glass window of the search room. A Corrections
       Officer is conducting a search. Oscar's face is bruised under
       his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the
       left side of his face. He turns around, bends over and
       coughs. He turns back around, and the officer hands him his
       Blue shirt and pants. Oscar puts them on and-

       BUZZ. The door opens, and Oscar walks through the large room

       notices a Zales engagement ring poster.

       He pulls out his phone. Starts to text.

       We see it is a gnarly- looking male PIT BULL sniffing around
       a few feet from Oscar's tires. It looks to be maybe 3 or 4
       years old. Oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over.

       Oscar pets him on the head, we see its ears are a bit
       scarred, but it has beautiful brown eyes. He feels around the
       dog's neck- no collar. Oscar looks around for an owner for a
       beat while the dog licks his hand.

       CLICK- Oscar's gas tank is full. He turns away from the dog,
       places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap
       back in. He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see
       him. He scans the block and panic strikes his face. He takes
       off running towards the street.

       Oscar looks around and heads over to some standing room next

       wearing a ball gown and leather jacket.

       Across from her sit KAREN and DONALD, a White couple dressed
       in similar clothing. There is an empty seat next to Danae,
       but Oscar, Sophina, Tim, Kris, Vanessa, and Carlos all remain      
       standing. Brandon, however, slides into the empty seat. He

       following closely behind him. He spots Sammy, Middle Eastern,     
       Early 50's, closing the metal gates on his store.

       Oscar trots up ahead of the group to Sammy.

       a North Face jacket. His wife STEPH, 30's is six months
       pregnant, and is doing the same potty dance we saw earlier
       from Vanessa.

       Oscar pounds on the glass door of the liquor store. Sammy

       Oscar nods, and begins to looks around the car for a less
       dense section. He makes out a small space in the corner of
       the train car, and starts towards it. He passes by an OLDER
       COUPLE, white 40's. This is MR. and MRS. ZAFIRATOS. They
       stand next to their SON (9)and DAUGHTER (14).

       As Oscar pushes past him, Mr. Zafiratos gives Oscar an
       unwelcome look. He pulls his daughter away as to avoid Oscar
       bumping up against her. Oscar exchanges a look with him
       briefly, and continues to push towards the space.

       The Train comes to a stop, and commuters crush onto the car.

       We see Katie, from Farmer Joe's, standing a few people in
       front of Oscar wearing a jacket over the same outfit. She's
       hugged up with JOE, a handsome white man in his 20's wearing
       a CAL sweatshirt. He holds her protectively.

       DING. The doors close, and the train takes off.

       Katie closes her eyes and leans into Joe's chest for a beat,
       then Joe pulls her out of the way of a passenger who squeezes
       by. Katie opens her eyes, and sees that the passenger is
       Oscar. Her face lights up.

        Sophina tries to find her words. Lets the water run on her
        face for a bit, then rubs down the friz in Tatiana's hair.

                  God... and the angels?

                  he took Daddy to come and live in
                  heaven with him.

        Tatiana looks at Sophina for a long beat.

</b>                   But I don't want Daddy to live in
                   heaven. I want him to be with me.

</b>                   He can't. Once you go to heaven,
                   you can't come back.

      Tatiana thinks about this.

</b>                   Well does he have his cellphone?
                   Maybe if I call him and talk to
                   him, he will come back.

</b>                   No. Daddy doesn't have his
                   cellphone baby. You can't call him
                   where he is.
