          A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling.
          Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across
          the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as
          an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape.
          A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily
          ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance
          it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of
          cockpit windows come into view as we move closer.
          Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.

          Like every other kid on my block, I was
          in the middle of a dream, envious of
          those who were chosen to be part of
          mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of
          the unknown and trying to imagine what
          only the lucky few would encounter.
           We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...

          Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty
          flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
          blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
          the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been
          suddenly evacuated.
          Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.

<b>          BOWER.(V.0.)
</b>          As the entire world watched in wonder,
          there were only a few, skeptical of the
          journey's success.

</b>          Only a few... who would be right.
          The further we move into the ship... signs of violence
          appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
          bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.
          The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument
          between men, panicked rage over-lapping.

          violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
          chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
          Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body
          still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,
          a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing
          in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.
          Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose
          as he continues to type commands into the flight computer...
          heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams.

          bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep
          pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent

          obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each
          of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass.

          Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps
          through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask
          attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
          CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His
          chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
          Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles
          flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,
          ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.

          His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch
          door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges.
          THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers
          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the
          floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.
          He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath
          him, collapsing. He yells at the floor.

          His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as
          he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet,
          muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.

          A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional
          MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through
          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...
          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's
          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope
          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.
          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown
          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...
          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.
          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A
          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into
          his mouth as possible.
          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.
          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He
          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the
          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.
          The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside
          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.

          He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that
          reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar.

          The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver
          travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby
          computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal.
          Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.

          fingers. He wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick
          layer of dust. Under the smear is...
          Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D.
          He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling
          uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes
          a fist with concern.

          He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized
          belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar.
          He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily
          substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification
          tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005Â»015.
          He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military
          markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool

          BOWER lunges and they go into a violent spin, crashing over a
          table. Dishes clatter, gasps and grunts... only glimpses of
          the fight through the flicker of light.
          CRACK! BOWER'S hit, sent flying and he looks up to see her
          silhouette approaching, edged weapon in her hand.

          she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to
          fend her off. She throws the blade, the blunt end deflecting
          off his forearm.

          He wields the only weapon he can find... his shoe. And her
          attack abruptly halts, slowly back pedalling with fright.
          BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him.
          A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the
          corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the
          kitchen... gone.

          carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of
          blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip, fueled with a chemical sprayer
          like a welder's torch.
          His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior,
          scantily clad, elongated muscular frames, pale skin coated in
          hydraulic fluid. Bald head with clumps of tangled hair. It
          moves smoothly and silently, jabbing the tip of the flaming
          device into each corner and crevasse, as if flushing out
          anything hidden.

          The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on
          the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us
          instantly into darkness.
          BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his
          knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an
          uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one.
          Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly
          emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an
          assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of
          sharpened metal.
          The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and
          strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an
          assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat
          and gargled CACKLES.
          On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME
          crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The
          hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris,
          following NADIA'S path.
          As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and
          terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds...

          WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from
          HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before
          turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into

          weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and
          a maze of piping.
          BOWER spots a clear path but BUMPS into glass. He realizes
          the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers. He
          changes directions and sees SHEPARD crawling through a vent.
          He tries to follow as... a BLUE TORCH moves past the doorway,
          bare feet running across steel. A collection of HISS and
          CACKLES grow louder.
          BOWER crawls under piping to hide. He notices the activation
          lights on his weapon fading... and he quietly tries to give
          the energy lever a few turns... but the WHINE seems too loud.
          He spots SHEPARD twenty feet away, hidden behind a console.

          is released from the rig and SHEPARD bursts into a wild

          tremendous BLAST of energy off to the side.
          -The weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic
          material, but for safety precautions, it's unable to
          penetrate man-made materials like lead, glass or steel. It's
          unable to puncture the ship's hull.
          The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like
          lightening and echoes like thunder. The blast HITS the side
          of the wall with a deafening RIPPLE of aftershocks,
          shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not
          fastened down within a thirty foot radius. This little thing
          packs a punch.
          The HUNTERS turn towards BOWER, the lead hunter turning to
          reveal itself as...

          glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal
          I scars and distorted war paint. His eyes hidden under shadow.
          He slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head, much
          like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator.
          BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it
          toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He
          squeezes the trigger and...
          KA-WHAP! The gunshot is THUNDEROUS, HITTING the unseen glass
          divider between them. The safety glass absorbs the blast,
          sending a SHUDDER through the hull.
          HEFLIN barely flinches, stepping closer with a HISS. Off his
          command, the HUNTERS take chase, swarming in every direction,
          searching for a route around the glass divider.

          they're shortly going to be cornered and done for until...
          A SHUDDER is felt, a FLICKER of LIGHTS approaching. She goes
          to a control panel, holds down a switch and presses her palm
          F across a scanner.
          As the power SURGE passes, the control panel activates,
          scanning her hand and the steel door activates with a MOAN of

          heavily coated in sweat, desperation in his eyes. His hair

          weapon, tucking it away and cautiously approached GALLO for a
          closer inspection.

          a three-foot high, narrow passageway, a crawl space beneath a
          steel grated floor. He follows the tunnel into a large silo
          lined with octagonal filters.
          TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out, jabbing
          pipes into the grate overhead, unable to budge it.

          They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At
          one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and
          towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT.
          They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see...
          Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has
          been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner
          table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and
          various food containers. The tank appears empty.

          They climb into the empty tank, lined with valves and
          filtration screens. The music is playing from crackling
          speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead.
          TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps
          through the hatch... a wire SNAPS! Levers clank and a mouse-
          trap has triggered... SLAMMING the hatch closed. Trapped!
          They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in
          a panic. BOWER pans his light towards the catwalk only to
          see a FIGURE (LELAND) scampering through the shadows.
          Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor
          shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless
          gas hits them and they instantly gag, choking for air.
          With the slanted walls of the tank, there seems to be no
          escape, but TANAKA runs up the wall, diving and grabbing onto
          a pipe, climbing upward toward the catwalk.
          The shadowed FIGURE (LELAND) quickly hobbles to the railing.

          KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch
          like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the
          entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there's a
          BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks.
          LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock.

          from his face, bewildered. He's an older man who's lost all

          BOWER and NADIR exchange a look of uncertainty. The

          LELAND kicks a piece of equipment, correcting the music.

          The FIGURE is forced to climb down, hopping to the floor,
          BOWER waits with his gun raised. Out of the shadows steps...
          A ten-year-old CHILD HUNTER.
          BOWER flinches with shock. The CHILD is a younger version of
          the hunters, awkward physique, pale skin coated with
          hydraulic fluid, oblong shaped head, eyes hidden in shadow.

          LELAND stays behind, watching as they begin a perilous
          descent down the walls of the reactor bay wall. Clinging
          onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks, the odd-colored
          algae grows more and more dense... a dim glow slowly coming
          into view from below.
          With a gap in the catwalk, BOWER leaps across, nearly losing
          his grip. He looks down to see an odd pattern of white
          shapes near the bottom.
          Squinting into the darkness, he's unable to make out what
          he's looking at and he manages to crawl down further,
          reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor.
          He motions for NADIA and TANAKA to stay put and begins
          crawling across... towards a darkened control panel.

          the railing and... a pen-lamp slips free from his belt.
          The pen-lamp CLANKS off one of the catwalks and tumbles past
          BOWER... dropping to the bottom... hitting the floor and
          illuminating the strange white objects covering the floor
          as... DOZENS of HUNTERS, all sleeping. Their pale white
          bodies are intertwined and over-lapped resembling an orgy of
          the living dead.

          BOWER remains frozen, gripping the gangplank that hangs
          twenty feet above the field of sleeping HUNTERS.

          into the folds of flesh and BOWER continues his crawl
          across... reaching the control panel.

          away, exiting the room. NADIA and TANAKA grip the ladders,

</b>          They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs
          within the ocean waves. They're just off shore from a
          stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing
          against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and
          their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth.
          Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a
          brilliant glow on the horizon.

</b>
          Pitch black. A low CHURNING is heard, a motor that is
          pumping as the water lowers, allowing us to see across the
          dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water.
          The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as
          unseen bilge pumps are heard loudly WHIRLING. The pump
          motors whine down and shut off as...

</b>          standing at the console, having changed clothes and recovered
          from the ordeal. He examines the empty tank where BOWER'S
          sleep chamber once sat. He eyes the other sleep-chambers,
          deeply contemplating.
          He goes back to the control console, scanning across the
          numerous surveillance monitors that reveal...
          PASSENGERS and HUNTERS engaged in a variety of activities all
          across the ship. Some are seen fighting, some searching for
          food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping. A
          kingdom, for the taking.
          He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself
          a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens.
          He glances over to see... YOUNG GALLO, the younger version of
          himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin. The
          blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean
          uniform.

<b>                         YOUNG GALLO
</b>          Well, if you're gonna be captain... what
          are we gonna do now?
          Off his look...

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATER
</b>
          SHUSH... THUD. Doors open to another sleep chamber
          compartment, completely undisturbed. Four undisturbed sleep-
          chambers are lined against the wall.
          GALLO enters, now wearing the CAPTAIN'S uniform, he
          straightens his collar and kneels next to one of the pods,
          typing into the panel. A grin appears as he removes the
          wedding ring (PAYTON'S ring) he'd forgotten he's still
          wearing.

<b>                         GALLO

          He hits the control panel switch and...

<b>          INT. SLEEP CHAMBER
</b>
          A FEMALE CREW MEMBER, a beautiful young woman, deep in hyper--
          slumber suddenly twitches... her EYES opening wide with a
          GASP as she stares into CAMERA.
