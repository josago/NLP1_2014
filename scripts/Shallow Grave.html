          face, eyes motionless and unblinking.

</b>          Take trust, for instance, or friendship: these are the important 
          things in life, the things that matter, that help you on your 
          way. If you can't trust your friends, well, what then?

</b><b>          EXT. DAWN 
</b><b>          
</b>          A series of fast-cut static scenes of empty streets. 
<b>

</b>          This could have been any city: they're all the same.
<b>          
</b>          A rapid, swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow 
          lanes and passageways. Accompanied by soundtrack and credits.
<b>          
</b>          The track ends outside a solid, fashionable Edinburgh tenement.

</b>          At the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement. The 
          door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed 
          with the names of three tenants. They are Alex Law, David 
          Stevens, and Juliet Miller.
<b>          
</b>          A man climbs the stairs and reaches the door. He is Cameron 
          Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and 
          lank, greasy hair. He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag. 
          Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands 
          back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is 
          answered.
<b>          
</b><b>          CAMERON
</b>          Hello, I've come about the room.
<b>          
</b>          Cameron enters and the door closes.

</b><b>          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          David, Alex, and Juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly 
          opposite Cameron, who shifts uneasily in his armchair. Alex 
          checks some items on a clipboard before speaking.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          What's his name?
<b>

          Really?

</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          (to Cameron)
          What?
<b>          
</b>          Cameron is not sure what to say.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
<b>          
</b><b>          CAMERON
</b>          Yes, thanks.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
<b>          
</b><b>          CAMERON
</b>          Yes.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          And you like it?
<b>          
</b><b>          CAMERON
</b>          Oh, yes, it's great.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, 
          don't you think?
<b>          
</b><b>          CAMERON
</b>          Yes.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, 
          all that crap.
<b>          
</b><b>          CAMERON
</b>          Well, yes.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I 
          want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would 
          want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          As Cameron plods slowly down the stairs, his shoes striking out 
          against the stone steps, Alex's criticisms continue.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (VOICE-OVER)
</b><b>          
</b>          I mean, my first impression, and they're rarely wrong, is that 
          you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a 
          prospective flatmate. I'm talking here about things like 
          presence, charisma, style and charm, and I don't think we're 
          being unreasonable. Take David here, for instance: a chartered 
          accountant he may be, but at least he tries hard. The point is, I 
          don't think you're even trying.
<b>          
</b>          Cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs. He opens the main 
          door.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          And, Cameron -- I mean this -- good luck!
<b>          
</b>          Cameron leaves and the main door closes behind him.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          Do you think he was upset?
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Inside the hall of the flat, David approaches the door toopen it. 
          Freeze-frame.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (VOICE-OVER)
</b>          David likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box 
          marked, not just shoelaces', but spare shoelaces'.
<b>          
</b>          David opens the door to the Woman.
<b>          
</b><b>          WOMAN
</b>          I've come to see about the room.

</b><b>          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Outside the door of the flat a young Goth girl, aged about 
          twenty, rings the doorbell.

</b><b>          JULIET
</b><b>          (VOICE-OVER)
</b>          Alex is a vegetarian. Do you know why? Because he feels it 
          provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous 
          personality. It doesn't. He thinks he's the man for me. He isn't, 
          though there was a time when, well, there was a time when...
<b>          
</b>          Alex opens the door to the Goth.

</b><b>          
</b>          Inside the hall of the flat Juliet approaches the door to open

<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b><b>          (VOICE-OVER)
</b>          Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling 
          a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what I think when I 
          think of Juliet.
<b>          
</b>          Juliet opens the door to the Man.
<b>          
</b><b>          MAN

</b><b>          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          In the living room each of the candidates is interviewed 
          individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i.e. 
          the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair). What we see 
          are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews. We 
          do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see 
          some facial reaction.
<b>          
</b>          All of David's questions are to the Woman.
<b>          
</b>          All of Alex's questions are to the Goth.
<b>          
</b>          All of Juliet's questions are to the Man.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          All right, just a few questions.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          Why do you want a room here?
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Do you smoke?
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare 
          hands, do you then summon hellfire?
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden 
          agenda?
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either 
          divorced or you're not.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd 
          like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit 
          singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of 
          black to wear?
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not 
          having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, 
          this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad 
          thing?
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: 
          Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of 
          emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner 
          of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Did you ever kill a man?
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are 
          the sunshine of my life'?
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but 
          D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I 
          were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the 
          alphabet of love.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          And what if I told you that I was the antichrist?

</b><b>          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
</b><b>          
</b>          In a sports centre Juliet sits outside a glass-walled squash 
          court. She is ready to play, but at present is watching Alex and 
          David, who are inside the court.

</b><b>          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
</b><b>          
</b>          Inside the squash court, Alex is about to serve.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for 
          personal domination.

</b>          Serve.

<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          In the same fashion as chess.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          What?
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Chess. Chess is often used as well.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Will you shut up and play.
<b>

</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Defeat, defeat, defeat-- sporting,personal, financial, 
          professional, sexual, everything. Next.

</b>          Alex sits in the back, drinking.
<b>          
</b>          Juliet is driving. David sits beside her.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          I wasn't trying to win.
<b>          
</b>          There is no response from Juliet.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to 
          know: I wasn't trying to win.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive 
          competitive urges.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          You learn that in your psychotherapy group?

</b>          Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
<b>

</b>          I thought you stopped going.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people 
          should know that.
<b>          
</b>          Alex leans close to Juliet. Juliet brakes abruptly and, as Alex 
          flies forward, elbows him in the chest.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort 
          of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of 
          thing.
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.

</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          For the flat.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to 
          that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked 
          her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We 
          had chemistry.
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          She hated you --
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Well, she had problems --
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. 
          But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't

</b><b>          HUGO
</b>          Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, 
          and now I'm trying to write a novel.
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET

<b>

<b>          
</b><b>          HUGO
</b>          Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's 
          about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't 
          die. You see, it's better already.
<b>

<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          No, she's not in. 
          Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks 
          to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the

</b>          Alex returns to the kitchen, pausing only to knock at Hugo's 
          door, which elicits no response. In the kitchen Juliet sits 
          dressed for work, having just returned. He casually opens an 
          envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing 
          it to her.

</b>          Inside Hugo's room we see the door as David, outside, throws 
          himself against it. At the third attempt the lock gives way and 
          the door bursts open.
<b>          
</b>          In the foreground at one side is the bed with a naked foot lying 
          still and exposed.
<b>          
</b>          When the door is open, David is first in, followed by the other 
          two. There is a period of silent shock as they contemplate Hugo's 
          naked corpse. Alex opens a window.
<b>

          happened. What do you think?
<b>          
</b>          Quite casually, Alex begins to open drawers and cupboards, 
          emptying the contents on to the floor.

</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be 
          rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
<b>          
</b>          In a drawer in a bedside cabinet, Alex finds needles, syringes 
          and a small bag of powder. Without comment, he holds it up and 
          throws it on the bed.
<b>          
</b>          He reaches under the bed and pulls out a case, which he opens. It 
          is empty and he pushes it back under.
<b>

          looks into it, then, seeing the contents, she replaces the 
          receiver. As she does so, the Operator's voice is audible for a

</b><b>          
</b>          David sits at his desk, looking across the office.
<b>          
</b>          Crouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women 
          in suits are pouring over folders and columned books. No one is 
          speaking except in muted tones on the telephones.
<b>          
</b>          David watches them. He looks to his left and to his right: on 
          either side young men like him are toiling over accounts. He 
          turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants 
          sit.
<b>          
</b>          He turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously 
          given. He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large 
          total at the bottom.
<b>          
</b>          When David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk. She 
          smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding 
          scene.

</b><b>          (VOICE-OVER)
</b>          OK. Let's do it.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. DIY STORE. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Inside a large, brightly lit DIY store with Muzak playing in the 
          background. We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked 
          with potentially vicious tools.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (VOICE-OVER)
</b>          All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a 
          way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, 
          then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, 
          dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either 
          by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I 
          have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the 
          forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which 
          we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as 
          simple as that.
<b>          
</b>          As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as 
          he looks at something off picture. Suddenly a spring-loaded 
          screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few 
          millimeters from his face. David winces as we see that Alex is 
          holding it.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          I always wondered what these were for.
<b>          
</b>          Alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across 
          the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          Now this is what we need. And this. 
<b>          
</b>          Alex hands the tools to David, who looks at them with disgust. 
          Alex walks on.

          don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat 
          smells. We can't wait any longer.

          the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting. They come into view and 
          go down the stairs. They are all very tense and freeze with panic 
          after accidentally banging against another flat's door. They 
          swear at one another and continue theri descent.

          the dark interior, the outline of the plastic lump is just 
          visible, thanks to a streetlight. One of the doors opens again 
          and David throws a bag of tools in. He then closes and locks the

          the van come into view.
<b>          
</b>          It pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is 
          switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the 
          van.
<b>          
</b>          In fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David 
          and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of 
          grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds 
          them out.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play 
          or not?
<b>          
</b>          Alex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one 
          of the stems. It is one of the larger ones.
<b>          
</b>          Alex and Juliet turn to David. Alex holds out the stems. David 
          reaches out and takes one of the tips. It is the short straw.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          I can't do it.

</b><b>          
</b>          Deeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little 
          light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders. His 
          right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a 
          vicious sawing noise. The sawing stops as he evidently finished 
          with one extremity. He shuffles back and starts sawing at 
          another.
<b>          
</b>          Alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug. He 
          observes David impassively. The sawing stops again.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Finished.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          But not quite.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Is that going to be deep enough?
<b>          
</b>          Alex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards 
          David.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Don't you worry about that.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Is this necessary?
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
<b>          
</b>          Most reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who 
          gestures as if to say, "On you go.' With revulsion on his face, 
          he raises the hammer above his head.

<b>          
</b>          He lies fully clothed on his bed, looking up at the ceiling. 
          There is a knock at the door, then Juliet walks in.

</b>          David is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft. 
          Beneath him is a stepladder. Juliet stands half-way up the 
          ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it. As David enters 
          the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it 
          on up to David.
<b>

          across beams and pipes. There are no skylights.
<b>          
</b>          He stops and leans against some structure (the water tank). He 
          strains to see in the darkness.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water 
          empties from the water tank. David is startled and steps forward, 
          tripping. He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch. 
          Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across 
          some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank, 
          the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old 
          brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out.

          Andy, who declines.
<b>          
</b>          They slide off the deep freeze and open it.
<b>          
</b>          Inside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord. 
          They lift him up. He is very cold and weak.
<b>          
</b>          The Man begins to whisper inaudibly. Andy moves his head so that 
          he can hear the whisper. He listens, then nods approvingly.
<b>          
</b>          They push him down again and close the lid. Andy holds the lid 
          while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top.

</b><b>          INT. CHARITY BALL. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Alex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball. Everyone is 
          dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the 
          addition of a significant number of kilts.
<b>          
</b>          Neither Alex nor David wears a kilt. The trio seem to know a 
          number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak 
          to them.
<b>          
</b>          A middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is 
          standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to 
          the diners who are still sat at their tables.
<b>          
</b><b>          MC
</b>          Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of 
          all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting 
          our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit.
<b>          
</b>          There is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out. We move to 
          the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated. Alex leans 
          across to Juliet.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children. 
          I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down.
<b>          
</b>          Some other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex.
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          Sshh.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          I want my money back. Excuse me.
<b>          
</b>          Alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his 
          fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already 
          ists in front of him.
<b>          
</b><b>          MC
</b>          For all too often there's a complacency: out of sight, out of 
          mind, let someone else bother about these things.
<b>          
</b>          Alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own. Juliet nudges 
          him viciously.

</b>          The MC's drone continues in the background while conversation 
          continues back at the table.

</b><b>          INT. DANCE FLOOR. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          The dance floor a few minutes later. It is packed and rather 
          chaotic. Sweaty, dishevelled dancers sling one another around, 
          with the thud of flesh against flesh. Toes are stood on and 
          jackets discarded.
<b>          
</b>          Juliet dances with Alex, who plunges in with the maximum of 
          violence, eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among 
          the other dancers.
<b>          
</b>          He starts to get up, then rests his head back against the floor.
<b>          
</b>          David has not been dancing. Instead he remains at their table and 
          at the bar, drinking steadily and watching the other two.

</b><b>          
</b>          Back at the table, while most people are still on the dnace

</b>          Alex pours champagne on to a stack of glasses.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to

<b>          
</b>          Alex drinks, then puts his glass down. Juliet drinks but does not 
          drain her glass. David sits still.

</b>          It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
<b>          
</b>          David reaches out to take his glass. Suddenly, Alex flings an arm 
          out to point, knocking over David's glass and completely losing 
          interest.

<b>          
</b>          From some distance away, Cameron becomes aware of Alex and 
          cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from 
          the table.

</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk to my girlfriend, you 
          talk to me first. If you want to dance with her, then you apply 
          in writing three weeks in advance or you're gonna end up insode a 
          fucking bin-bag. You didn't apply, so you don't dance.
<b>          
</b>          Shocked and frightened, Brian backs away, then turns around to 
          complete his departure. Juliet restrains David with a touch as 
          they watch him go.
<b>          
</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?

</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          That was stressful. I found that stressful.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', 
          I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the 
          full there.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          You think so?

</b>          The gents' toilet. Brightly-lit and white-tiled. Alex walk in and 
          goes into a cubicle and closes the door. We hear him whistling 
          and laughing as he passes urine. He keeps muttering bin-bag' to 
          himself. Then he flushes the toilet and opens the door. As he 
          does so a look of surprise appears on his face as he sees someone 
          waiting for him.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Cameron! What a surprise.
<b>          
</b>          As Alex is speaking Cameron's fist flies forward, hitting him in 
          the face and sending him flying backwards. Cameron enters the 
          cubicle and closes the door behind him.

          the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden 
          sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same 
          again.
<b>          
</b>          Alex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play 
          button on a tape recorder. The music begins.
<b>          
</b>          Fast cuts follow, occasionally interrupted by out-of-focus shots 
          of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is 
          switched on and off.

</b>          Someone attempts to open the door but cannot because there are 
          two new security chains on the inside. The door is forced against 
          the chains with no success and Alex calls from the other side.

          grinning at him while he releases the chains and then opens the

          the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat.
<b>

<b>

          crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's

          Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly

          David. He stands perfectly still.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly 
          there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing 
          heavily on and across some beams in the loft.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. LOFT. NIGHT

          but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living 
          room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks 
          back and up towards the trapdoor.

          into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the 
          light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and 
          he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He 
          looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy 
          lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour 
          out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a 
          second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only 
          centimetres from his own.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. HALL. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Alex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud 
          thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then 
          Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down 
          to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his 
          head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes 
          one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his 
          mouth.
<b>          
</b>          Tim's body lands on Andy.
<b>          
</b>          David drops himself from the hatch to the floor.
<b>          
</b>          David takes a large knife from a wooden block.
<b>          
</b>          Back in the hall he kneels, holding the knife, beside Tim. 
          Noticing something at the top of tim's neck, he uses the knife to 
          lift away Tim's T-shirt. A tattoo covers Tim's neck. David looks 
          at it, then stands up.
<b>          
</b>          He walks through to the living room, where Alex and Juliet, still 
          bound, watch him approach. He looks at them for a moment, then 
          extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place.

</b>          In a scene similar to the dismemberment of Hugo, we see David's 
          shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen. He stops 
          and reaches out for the hammer, picks it up and raises it above 
          his head.

</b>          A thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition. Juliet observes

          unable to start. On the screen of his word processor is a page 
          mock-up with the headline CATS EAT PENSIONER'. As the telephone 
          on his desk rings, he is startled, then reaches out, slowly lifts 
          it fractionally and replaces it.

          he cannot hear them, but he keeps looking up at the ceiling, as 
          though he expects to hear them or see somwthing.
<b>          
</b>          Eventually he turns the sound back down and, after a moment's

</b>          Without warning there is the sound of an electric drill.

<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Of course.

<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went 
          downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just 
          stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and 
          then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And 
          that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, 
          I don't think.
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          did you hear anything before he cries?
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the

</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          No, nothing, sorry.

</b>          Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
<b>

</b>          Of course.
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?

</b>          Who said there were four?
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of 
          course, but now, four.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          No, three. Who said there were four?
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading 
          information. Only three people here. You're sure?
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Yes, absolutely.
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. 
          Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no 
          preference. Which are you using?
<b>          
</b><b>          MITCHELL
</b>          Both, sir.
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my 
          tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          I see.
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
<b>          
</b>          Uncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even 
          this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has 
          underlined a short segment of it.

          tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock. David looks 
          on.
<b>

</b>          Someone lost the key.
<b>          
</b>          McCall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall 
          illuminates Hugo's room.
<b>          
</b><b>          MCCALL
</b>          Is this where no one stays?

</b>          All right, David, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to open this

          remain calm.
<b>          
</b>          There is one light on. Juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder. 
          Having opened the trapdoor, Alex stops and listens, but there is 
          no sound above his own breathing. Juliet throws up a torch, which 
          he catches. He switches it on. It shines, then goes out, and he 
          knocks it against the ladder, making it work again. Slowly he 
          pushes the trapdoor open.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          The trapdoor opens. Below it, Alex crouches on the ladder, 
          expecting attack at any moment. He looks back down to Juliet, who 
          returns his gaze, then he slowly raises himself into the loft.
<b>          
</b>          He turns around quickly, darting the torchlight around into 
          corners and squinting in the darkness, but he sees nothing.
<b>          
</b>          The torch goes out. Cursing, he knocks it against a beam and it 
          shines again.
<b>          
</b>          Slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the 
          loft, still turning around and worried about what might be behind 
          him.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. HALL. NIGHT

</b><b>          
</b>          Alex is still looking but has relaxed a little, feeling les in 
          danger. In one corner he notices David's pile of left-possessions 
          and the mat on which he has been sleeping. He moves towards it.

          her mouth, gripping her tightly while his other hand clamps on 
          the back of her head. David's mouth is right up against her ear 
          as he spits a warning into it.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Tell him to look for the money.

</b><b>          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Alex stands gazing around the loft.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          (from the loft)
          Well, it's not up here.

</b><b>          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Alex is about to descend when he notices the water tank. He walks 
          over and lifts the lid. His face breaks into a smile as he 
          realizes what it holds. He dips an arm into the tank, raises the 
          yellow bag, then quickly lowers it again. Alex steps back from 
          the water tank.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. HALL. NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Alex appears at the top of the ladder. Without looking, he slides 
          down as quickly as he can, calling out as he does so.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Juliet, I have --
<b>          
</b>          Alex reaches the base of the ladder. He turns around to find 
          himself facing the blade of the battery-operated drill, held by 
          David. Juliet stands off to one side.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          -- a problem.
<b>          
</b>          David holds the drill even closer until it is almost touching the 
          centre of Alex's forehead and presses the trigger' to turn the 
          blade slowly as he speaks.
<b>          
</b>          Alex does not move at all.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          You looking for me?
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Looking for you? Yes.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          We just wanted to speak to you.
<b>          
</b>          Alex's hands and sleeves are wet. A few drops of water fall from 
          his fingertips. Unnoticed by the other two, he slowly wipes his 
          hands on the back of his jeans.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Who else have you wanted to speak to? Maybe you thought they'd 
          already got me.
<b>          
</b>          The blade os the drill scrapes Alex's skin.
<b>          
</b><b>          ALEX
</b>          Who?
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID

</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          He doesn't know David.
<b>          
</b>          David holds the drill back slightly while he thinks. It could go 
          either way.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          Well, maybe you don't --

</b>          Alex has just woken up. He rubs his forehead. There is a nick in 
          it, where the drill has scratched. He rubs at it and examines the 
          drop of blood on the end of his finger.

</b>          David scurries back across the beams to look down through another

<b>          
</b>          NOTE In the following sequence, Juliet's face is not seen until 
          her comment on it.

</b>          Juliet moves about her room. She is wearing a large, baggy T-

          scrambles back across to his mat, where he sits back down and 
          closes his eyes. Then he opens them and scrambles back to look 
          down again.

</b><b>          
</b>          David takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a 
          glass. He sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that 
          we cannot see. The expression oh his face does not change and his 
          voice is impassive.
<b>          
</b><b>          DAVID
</b>          I thought you'd gone to work.

</b><b>          JULIET
</b>          I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are 
          now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you

</b><b>          INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE. DAY
</b><b>

</b><b>          EXT. FOREST. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Several police and unmarked vehicles, including one mobile 
          incident room', stand on a rough track. Another car arrives at 
          the end and is parkeed to one side. Alex steps out.
<b>          
</b>          From where he stands, Alex can see towards the site of the 
          burials. There are a few policemen, uniformed and plain-clothes, 
          and a small knot of journalists, kept at bay by plastic tape 
          draped from tree to tree. Mounds of earth mark the site of the 
          exhumations.
<b>          
</b>          Alex walks past the other journalists into the woods. He looks 
          back towards the sight, then turns to look in the opposite 
          direction. He finds himself at the edge of a golf course. From 
          the green to the graves is hardly any distance.
<b>          
</b>          To one side, Alex sees McCall and Mitchell, hunched in earnest 
          discussion. Mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches Alex's eye.
<b>          
</b><b>          BINT. KITCHEN/HALL. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The kitchen is empty. We track through the kitchen and out into 
          the hall, stopping at the door to Juliet's room.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          David and Juliet are seated on the bed. Among the junk on her 
          bedside table is the Polaroid photograph of Alex, propped up 
          against a tumbler. Juliet reaches out and turns it away before 
          pulling David towards her.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. MOBILE INCIDENT ROOM. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs. Alex 
          sits at the back, near the half-open door. At the other end, 
          three police officers face them. They are a medium-ranking 
          Uniformed Officer, and to one side of him Mitchell and then 
          McCall, both of whom sit in silence.
<b>          
</b><b>          UNIFORMED OFFICER
</b>          All right, ladies and gentlemen, the releasable and print-worthy 
          facts of the day so far are as follows. Late yesterdat afternoon, 
          forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a 
          grave which appeared to have been recently dug. Further 
          excavation on our part has revealed two similar, deeper graves, 
          again containing human remains.
<b>          
</b>          Alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial 
          site, now enclosed in a plastic tent. He continues to stare at 
          it.
<b>          
</b>          While Alex is looking, the sound of laughter and Uniformed 
          Officer's subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory 
          of a sound in Alex's head: it is the noise of the saw going back 
          and forth across the victim's limbs.
<b>          
</b><b>          UNIFORMED OFFICER
</b><b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>          As and when the corpses are removed, we will endeavour to 
          ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial, as well as 
          identification, which will of course be passed on to you after 
          informing, where possible, the next of kin.
<b>          
</b>          Alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. FOREST. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Alex walks away from the incident room towards his car. He breaks 
          into a run for a few paces.
<b>          
</b>          The noise of the sawing continues.
<b>          
</b>          As he reaches his car, Alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys. 
          He is sweating and trembling. He drops his keys. As he bends down 
          to pick them up, his foot slips on the wet grass. He falls to his 
          knees, his forehead banging against the car door. He kneels for a 
          moment, gripping the keys, his head resting against the door.
<b>          
</b>          The noise of the sawing stops.
<b>          
</b>          From behind, the arm of a Police Constable reaches out and his 
          hand rests on Alex's shoulder.
