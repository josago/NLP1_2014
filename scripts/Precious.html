    A line at a time, the following quote appears over a black
    screen.


              Every blade of grass has its Angel
              that bends over it and whispers,
              "Grow, grow."

    A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street
    lamp.

    An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. A
    stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on.

    A book bag drops onto the pavement.

    Visible from the waist down, a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a
    disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and
    then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk.

    Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they
    stop abruptly.

    Here, for the first time, we see her PLUMP, YOUTHFUL, VACANT
    AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE. It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES.
    Something inside the bin has caught her attention.

    Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book
    as the breath from her nostrils steams. The title of the book
    staring back up at her is unintelligible.

    She pushes debris aside to get to it.

    The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee.

    The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches.

    Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the
    sounds of the oncoming car close in.

    Precious finally comes up with the book. Its title is still
    unintelligible. When she flips it over, however, the letters
    on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. They read
<b>    CRYSTAL STAIR: SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES.

</b>    The car sounds incredibly close.

    Precious looks sharply to her left.

    AN EERIE SKID precedes an eerier THUD! Precious, almost hit,
    falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the
    intersection and down into a drain.

    She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the
    street lamp with her eyes closed.

    The car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and
    SCREECHES off.

    The garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side
    until settling, to a stop.

    An ambulance eases up to the intersection.

    When the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past
    Precious in no hurry. A moment later, its sirens BLARE and it
    speeds off into the distance.

    The stray dog returns, re-investigates the garbage bin, and
    turns to Precious. He licks her face. Tom Cruise walks up to
    her.

    Precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom, and the
    red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her. Tom gives
    her a hand up.

<b>                        TOM
</b>                  (flirtatious)
              What's your name girl?

    Precious blushes.

<b>                        TOM
</b>              What's your name?

    Precious still blushing, looks on the ground.

     The end of a final wave of students head to class.

     Precious scurries behind them donning the red scarf and           
     lugging her book bag.

    Precious sits in the last row behind 26 children half her
    size, 3 years younger and mostly African American. Noise and
    projectiles fill the air.

    MR. WICHER -A FRAIL MAN IN A BOW TIE AND TWEED COAT, stands
    at the head of the class trying to establish order.

<b>                        MR. WICHER
</b>              Class, would you please turn to
              page 122 ...Class! 122!

    Precious' book stays closed as the other students find the
    page.

    TWO BOYS in front of Precious giggle boisterously at some
    private joke.

    Mr. Wicher looks annoyed but accustomed to this.

<b>                        PRECIOUS (V.O.)
</b>              I like maff but I don't say nuffin'
              -don't open my book even. Just sit
              there.

    The giggling boys continue their shenanigans.

<b>                           MR. WICHER
</b>              Boys?

    The boys finally open their books.

              catch up, be normal, sit in the
              front ...someday.

    The giggling flares up again. Precious sneers at the boys.

<b>                        MR. WICHER
</b>              Today we are going to review
              Monday's assignment. Would anyone
              like to begin?

    The boys get louder.

<b>                        BOY# 1
</b>              Excuse you?!

    The entire class cries, "OOOOOH". Mr. Wicher looks scared.

              I mean, Mr. Wicher.

    The boys fallout slapping hands.

    The class turns to Mr. Wicher in unison to see what he will
    do.

<b>                        MR. WICHER
</b>              I want to see you boys after class.

<b>                        MR. WICHER
</b>              Just be quiet.

    Mr. Wicher tries to carry on throughout the boys' unrelenting
    defiance. Other students are continually distracted by the
    boys. Precious looks bothered the most as Mr. Wicher's soft
    voice loses the battle.

<b>                        PRECIOUS (V.O.)

              He scared too. I feels sorry for
              him.

    The boys break out in RIOTOUS LAUGHTER until ...

    to see two large hands take hold of them and snatch them out
    of their chairs.

    Precious has had enough.

<b>                        PRECIOUS

    Mr. Wicher waves her inside.

    briefly and then whispers something to Mr. Wicher. Precious

               Claireece.

     Precious gathers her belongings. The other children watch
     every move in silence. When she reaches the front of the
     class ...

<b>                         PRECIOUS

     An unconvinced Precious grins sadly as Mrs. Lichenstein
     motions for Precious to step out ahead of her.

     Mr. Wicher looks abandoned. The door closing behind Precious
     might as well be to a prison cell block. Noise inside the
     classroom returns immediately.

     Precious whirls around to see A YOUNG MAN CIGARETTE IN HIS

     from the bottom up.

     Precious turns back around to find her server selecting
     pieces of chicken from a huge tray with large silver tongs.

      Ms. Rain's desk sits before six smaller ones situated in a
      semi-circle. Four of them are occupied by girls roughly
      Precious' age:

      LATIN DESCENT, PETITE GLOWING AND GORGEOUS. She twirls her
      hair incessantly with slender painted fingertips.

      A seventh desk sits well apart from the others back beneath
      the windows.

      The girls all stare up at Precious blankly as she enters the
      room. Precious looks to be in a mild state of shock as she
      gazes around from the girls to Ms. Rain to the clouds outside
      the windows.

      Precious looks from the distant desk to one up front and then
      back to the distant desk.

      She sits with the other girls delicately, as if she were a
      visitor in a complete stranger's home.

     Precious sucks her teeth in self-disgust as she looks around

     Surprised, Ms. Rain and the class turn to Precious. She is
     visibly uncomfortable and seems as if trying to hide in plain
     sight.

     The ghostly image of Ms. Rain appears on the sidewalk ahead

     writes D and hands it to Rita.

     Rita takes a step and starts to cry. She drops the chalk. It
     shatters on the floor.

     particular situation but what is that of countless others.

     In a decisive, almost militaristic movement, Ms. Rain sits up
     again.

     Precious rides on one of the side seats towards the back
     while wearing her red scarf.

     The New Yorkers surrounding her are all men of various
     backgrounds. All wear the exact same suits and raincoats.

     Precious looks up to find two of the businessmen staring down
     at her.

     We pan from them and around the bus to find all of the other
     passengers studying Precious in silence as well.

     Our long circular pan finally lands on Precious' seat but
     sitting there now is the pretty blond white girl from
     Precious' bedroom mirror wearing Precious' clothes.

     The bus grinds to a stop.

     A man smiles at Precious and steps off the bus.

     The original Precious takes the abandoned newspaper from his
     empty seat and tries to read it.

     Precious continues observing pensively as the ladies pass a
     bearded and bedraggled elderly white man laying on the street
     in tattered clothes.

     As Precious studies him, her expression changes ever so
     slightly.

     Enormous handwritten letters forming "NOT STUPID" overtake
     her face as we DISSOLVE TO the PAGE upon which she wrote it.

               Put 'em in. Tuck 'em in bed with
               you...

     The skinny woman on the other side sits up and grabs herself
     feverishly as if there were bugs allover her.

     AN ENORMOUS AND FEROCIOUS-LOOKING WOMAN IN HER FORTIES steps
     up, snatches the blanket off of Precious and Abdul and walks
     off.

<b>                         BUG LADY

</b>               Fuck you. I ain' giving back shit.

     The woman walks away.

     Physically and emotionally spent, Precious sighs and then
     lifts her bed's top sheet, beneath which is a plastic-covered
     mattress.

     She then wraps the sheet around Abdul and herself and hunkers
     down.

     Precious rocks Abdul gently as her eyes wander around the
     cavernous armory.

     Precious sleeps soundly.

     Something nudges her slightly.

     When she finally opens her eyes ...

     Abdul is gone! So is her bag.

     Precious springs up in a panic turning in every direction.

<b>                         PRECIOUS
</b>               Where my baby?! Where my baby at?!

     The Bug Lady casually points to the exit.

     The large ferocious woman heads for the exit with Abdul in
     one arm and Precious' bag in the other. She looks down at
     Abdul making "baby" faces and sounds.

     Precious dashes after her but winces in pain grabbing her
     pelvic area along the way.

     The Bug Lady follows Precious as a speed walker might.

     Precious snatches Abdul and promptly knees the ferocious
     woman hard in the gut.

     The ferocious woman MOANS as she falls to the ground.

     Precious continues kicking and stomping her without abandon.

     The bug girl observes stoically. Abdul WAILS.

     As she trounces the woman, Precious' eyes fill with a rage we
     haven't yet seen.

     Finally, two other women pull Precious away while she still
     kicks at the woman.

     The ferocious woman, now bloodied, falls over on her back
     with her eyes closed and her mouth hanging open.

      Ms. Rain steps into her classroom carrying two bags. She

      Precious sits at a small kitchen table in a modest but cozy
      and craftily-decorated apartment. Fresh flowers adorne her
      table.

      She breast feeds Abdul and drinks from a tall glass of grape
      juice. Ms. Rain clears the table of plates and take-out
      containers.

       Train Line and dance around the desk as Nurse John approaches
       Ms. Rain to converse.

      Precious' trophy sits on the windowsill beneath a thin a
      layer of dust.

      A stack of books sit on her bureau.

      Colorful letters and numbers hang on the wall. Beneath them
      hang postcards featuring Zora Neal Hurston, Alice Walker,
      Maya Angelou and Oprah Winfrey.

      Abdul sleeps in his crib.

      Precious descends a staircase to a long corridor clearly deep
      in thought every step of the way.

      She stops momentarily to straighten her clothes.

      When she finally reaches a day room at the other end of the
      hall, she looks through its window for a moment.

      Mary sits inside crushing and dwarfing the couch upon which
      she waits. She looks frail. Her wig is half combed. She's
      nervous. Her sweaty hands crumple her cigarette package.

      Precious covers her nose a moment, lowers her hand, readies
      herself and then steps into the room.

      face looks like stone.

      Mary looks up with a brief but quickly fading smile that is
      pathetic, apologetic and grim.

      Precious waits.

      The air is thick without a single word between them.

      suddenly been displaced with pity.

      Precious enters, takes Abdul from his crib, holds him closely
      and sits on her bed.

      Moments later, a TAPPING on the window draws her attention.

      Precious rises to find Tom Cruise hurling pebbles up at her
      window in a leather jacket.

      A MOTORCYCLE sits a few feet away from him.

      He beckons her.

      She stares down at him with solemn eyes.

      lower than usual as Precious' FOOTSTEPS make the most

      in her hand pointing to the word "unrelenting", which is

      Precious waits a moment and then shakes her head without
      looking up.

      Ms. Rain goes to her desk and picks up the journal without
      resistance.

      The words "Why me?" sit alone on the page with lines crossed
      through them. Ms. Rain returns the journal to Precious' desk
      still opened to the same page.

      The moment the door closes, Precious dashes across the room

      Precious searches the drawers in the cabinet and rifles
      through the files.

      thinks a moment and then looks for "C".

      Precious finally finds the file with her name on it and looks

      across the aisle and sits beside Precious who stares out the

                   is Irene. I am an incest
                   survivor...

      Precious looks utterly amazed. Her jaw drops. From here, the
      women's voices are so faint that they are barely audible as
      we hear Precious' thoughts.

<b>            PRECIOUS (V.O.)                             IRENE

      All kinda women in here.          fondling me. By the time I
      Princess girls, big girls,        was 12, he was having
      old women, young women, white     intercourse with me 3 or 4
      women, lotta white women.         Times a week...

      A montage of other women standing and speaking follows. As
      the women talk, Precious' face fills with the wonder of
      seeing the world through the window of a spacecraft headed
      for re-entry.

      CANDACE, SIXTIES, WHITE speaks next.

<b>             PRECIOUS (V.O.)                       CANDACE
</b>      What am I hearing?! What in       ....I didn't remember what my
      h
      the world?! One hour and a        father did to me for so many
       alf women talk. How can this     years until after he died...
      happen to so many people?

      CAITLIN, 20's, WHITE speaks.

<b>             PRECIOUS (V.O.)                       CAITLIN
</b>      And these is just the ones        ...I am a proud lesbian. But

      pass them in the street and       mental institution for 14
      do not know?                      years....

      Finally, Precious stands.

      She looks around as if seeing from the top of a mountain.

      Finally she clears her throat and then ...

<b>                             PRECIOUS
</b>                   I was raped by my father and beat

                Never said alla that before...

      Precious looks around the room to find herself surrounded by
      understanding eyes.

                for today. Thank y'all for letting
                me share...

      Irene nods and Precious sits. Rita squeezes her hand. Another
      woman stands up to recount her story. Precious looks aglow.

      The group slowly emerges. A table with a nice arrangement of
      cookies stands next to a coffee maker and soda machine.

      Irene chats with Candace over a cup of coffee. Precious and
      Rita talk with TWO OTHER YOUNG WOMEN, MIRIAM, BLACK 20's LONG
      PRETTY DREADLOCKS and LISA, WHITE 20's.

                if you want. That's what I do - fix
                people's hair and makeup.

      Miriam hands Precious a card. Precious reads the card
      carefully and puts it away with care.

       Precious stands up and looks down at Ruby, sulking in her        
       chair. She leans down, gives her a big hug and tenderly          
       fixes Ruby's hair.                                               

       Precious walks off toward the stairs, but stops when she         
       passes a mirror hanging on the wall. Within the reflection,      
       she sees her true self for the first time.

       She then reaches up and hugs Precious tightly.

       Through the embrace, Precious finds herself facing the many
