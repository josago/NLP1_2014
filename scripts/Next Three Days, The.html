    No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA,
    unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
    driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
    SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
    collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know
    something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read:

</b>
    Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
    LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN           
    is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
    kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
    to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
    is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
    LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
    to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
    at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
    brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,          
    if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
    her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.        
    Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.                

<b>                           LARA
</b>               You know what? If you were smart
               you would stop talking right now.

<b>                           ERIT
</b>               Sue me. I just know that women should                     
               never work for women.

    John laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head.                    

<b>                           LARA

</b>               They're always threatened. Especially
               if you're beautiful and they're not.

<b>                           LARA

    Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.

    That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.

    Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is

     Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't
     notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching
     him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.

     and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him.

     John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up
     her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his
     face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably.

     John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears
     run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her
     phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder --
     desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it.

     He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention

     through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls
     handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on
     the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes
     frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the
     counter, feeling destroyed and needy.

     And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another
     drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to
     move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue,
     places it on the counter and moves away.

     shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room.

      John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and
      snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors
      sees what he is doing but averts her eyes.

      John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the
      slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into
      the crowd and moves on.

      Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to
      the visiting room.

      steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past,
      noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn
      turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby
      and vomits.

      he can't let his brother see this.

                   her purse in the river. We paid for
                   dinner with the cash from her wallet.

      She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking
      in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior.

      what he has heard, playing out what she said in his head.
      Then suddenly he just stops. The crowd keeps moving, leaving
      him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing
      there. Commands him:

      her. Her eyes well up, and she smiles through her tears.

      John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner
      where he noticed kids selling drugs.

      A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The
      street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an
      exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks
      his watch and settles in to wait.

      then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks
      his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer
      runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the
      driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to
      call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.

      John follows.

      Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill.
      The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.

      Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then
      makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many
      houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks
      over the fences.

      He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a
      house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch.
      He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and
      the light goes out again.

      John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges
      a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are
      exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he
      came.

      John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the
      fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back
      yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside
      the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait
      between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.

      Fade to BLACK.      Beat, then:   BANG!   BANG!    BANG!

      John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks
      on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize
      he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,
      holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is
      no way he wouldn't see him.

      John holds his     breath and waits. The porch light flicks
      off, the locks     are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.
      As before, the     two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in
      John's ears is     so loud we can barely hear anything else.

      John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking
      over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!

      He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams
      him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --
      ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.

      Alex releases his BARKING German shepherd and it immediately

      Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims
      a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind
      David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely
      by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.

      John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and
      down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the
      next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM.

      Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind
      the small bed, his back to us.

      Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.

      A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's
      side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the
      floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...

      Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward.
      David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over
      him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and....

      John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down.

      empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns
      to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a
      safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag
      on the floor half-filled with cash.

      the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger
      seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a
      heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at
      the partially open window. John struggles to get the car
      turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his
      way into the car.

      Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the
      back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun.

      John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in
      the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the
      car, the thug getting off a shot.

      The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds

      Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the
      back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.

      John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of
      approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself
      in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.

      John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He
      steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes
      the door and gets in. As he drives away we see David's body

      The elevator doors open and John tosses the lab coats out
      toward a trash can in the direction of the garage. He pounds
      the elevator button.

      The elevator isn't closing. John slams the button repeatedly.
      He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims
      the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing.
      Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi
      gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs
      out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the
      parked cars.

      Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a
      SQUAD CAR racing down toward him. As it brakes, Nabulsi
      realizes they couldn't have escaped this way; he's been had.

      The doors open. John peers around the corner, hiding his
      weapon. No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors
      he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's
      hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner.

      They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing
      another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them.

      They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward
      them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when
      Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs
      past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken
      their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and
      turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and
      speaks.

      run in the front doors toward him. Nabulsi surveys the scene,

       Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very

       crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to                 
       a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving                      
       toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team

       Lara obeys without thinking. John checks his watch, then

      John brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an                    
      intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror,                 
      the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them.

      John's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer              
      at 35, praying he's not their target.

      The police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the
      four lane street.

      John breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch -
      29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS.

      John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to
      make this choice -- their freedom, or their son.

      Too many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can
      escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to
      them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his
      grandparents after all.

      Lara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch.
      John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he
      slams his foot on the brakes!

      The tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn.

      Horns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision.
      John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a
      circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder,
      miraculously facing in the right direction.

      John allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt.

      pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and                 
      comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel
      shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the
      field beyond. He sits beside her in silence.

      Behind them the cars whip by.    No one even thinks to stop to
      see if they need help.

      Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field.

      There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know
      how they got here.

      Their hands sit on the gravel between each other. Without
      looking at him, Lara tentatively entwines a single finger
