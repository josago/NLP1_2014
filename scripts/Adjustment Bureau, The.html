</b>
          DAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down,
          thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and
          confident. Content. Completely in his element.
          In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of
          individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the
          muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:

          A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.

          David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens
          his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.

          The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with
          approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of
          the Admin Building.

          The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing
          ovation.
          --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison
          plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most
          politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
          --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball
          with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby.
          --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin
          redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
          --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch
          David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama
          today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to
          follow him. Especially young people.
          --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands
          as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their
          camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to
          mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
          --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a
          tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking
          into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie
          stands nearby watching him speak:.

<b>          INT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK

          David enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly
          with the noisy energy of the campaign trail.
          He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a
          moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him.
          He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his
          itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and
          meetings across the state.
          He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the
          page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech
          he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open
          Space Initiative.

          His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning.
          He doesn't need to review. It's already all there.
          He closes his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks
          out at the trees.
          The silence back...it's deafening.

          Charlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David,
          holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him
          as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's
          clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him
          aside.

          you have to be up at four AM for us
          to make it in time.
          David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand
          he picks up a cup and saucer.

          This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen
          strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like
          having a life to him...

          overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story
          building. Their clothing is more timeless than old-

          David watches the election coverage on TV. Pundits are
          discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already
          called for David's opponent.

<b>                         PUNDIT #1
</b>          Congressman Norris has a reputation
          for being very direct, even blunt,
          in his campaign speeches, which is
          great until you say too many things
          you wish you hadn't. Then you
          start to look like an amateur.

<b>                         PUNDIT #2
</b>          That's bad for any candidate but
          it's fatal if you're running for
          Senate at the age of 33, your
          opponent keeps calling you an
          "impulsive kid," and you almost
          killed your entire political career
          five months ago with an act of
          immaturity that ended up on the
          front page of`.the New York Post.
          David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then
          Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is visible through
          the open door behind him.

          David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment
          that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going

          Suffolk county and in his home

          feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."

          The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked
          page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:
          Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric
          symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a
          language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
          And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the
          lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.

          an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last
          five steps and hits the floor hard.
          As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is
          frozen solid.
          David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find

           up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them
           warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a

          here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.

<b>           CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
</b>          How are you feeling about the
          speech?
          David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
          subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I'm ready... I changed a few
          things last night.

<b>          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
</b>          Tell me at breakfast.

<b>          THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID
</b>          David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is
          a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a
          moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.

<b>          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING
</b>
          David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the
          park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years
          ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.

<b>          INT. BUS -- MORNING
</b>
          David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the
          reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more
          out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.

<b>          INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING
</b>
          David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with
          a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the
          window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.
          DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2/12/09 42.
</b>          David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back
          now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same
          eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps
          to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Stop the bus.

<b>                         DRIVER

<b>          EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING
</b>
          The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as
          he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He
          catches up to her at University Place.

<b>                         DAVID

          And it's her...

          Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:

          I rode the Ml to work every day for
          the last three years hoping one day
          I'd run into you again.
          She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.

<b>                         ELISE

          She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his
          expression is dead serious.

<b>                         DAVID (CONT'D)
</b>          Can we go somewhere and talk?
          She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at
          herself for that, but it's the truth.

<b>                         ELISE

</b>          "I haven't seen you in three years -

          ideal come-on. For the record.
          David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone
          vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.

          concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on
          them.
          They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are
          parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen
          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;
          David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the
          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They
          hang their legs over the edge and jump.
          They sprint across the roof of the building next door --
          except somehow they find themselves running across the same
          roof they were just on.
          David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a
          moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open
          from inside.
          David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the
          building's edge they climb over again and... run...
          Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were
          on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.
          They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as
          Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent
          roofs. They're completely surrounded.
