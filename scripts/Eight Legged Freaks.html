</b>

<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
</b>
A rabbit hops across rough terrain.


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
</b>
Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of
toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP
<b>454.
</b>

<b>INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT
</b>
A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck.

<b>                         SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
</b>           I will be self-assured and
           confident around women.

<b>                         PIG PEN
</b>           I will be self-assured and
           confident around women.


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
</b>
The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first
truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses
the highway in front of the third.


<b>INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT
</b>
<b>                         SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
</b>           I will not fear the unexpected.

<b>                         PIG PEN
</b>           I will not fear the unexpected.

The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.

<b>                           PIG PEN
</b>           Ahhhhhhhhhh!

Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the
bunny.


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
</b>
The truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        2.
</b>
<b>INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT
</b>
Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain
control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the
rig together.


<b>EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic
waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the
water below.


<b>EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT
</b>
A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips
beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a
gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon
ink.


<b>EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY
</b>
The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of
INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly
net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized
horsefly.

JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger
is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with
people.

<b>                         JOSHUA
</b>          Hey, Mike.   Check this one out.

MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard
and fast for this bright, little nerd.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          He's huge!

<b>                        JOSHUA
</b>          They've been like this all week.
          Must be something extra tasty in
          the water.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Like what?

<b>                        JOSHUA
</b>          Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back
          in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a
          dash of habanero sauce. Mighty
          satisfying.

</b><b>                                                         3.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                              MIKE
</b>             You ate snake?

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             When you're thirty klicks out from
             the nearest firebase. Humpin'
             through the wake-up with your
             finger on the trigger. Charlie
             doesn't give you time to stop for
             cutlet.

As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a
familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-
colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.


<b>EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
nowhere.


<b>INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.

<b>                           CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>             Charlie, don't surf!

<b>                              JOSHUA
</b>             Quiet, bird.     We're working.

Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen
aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a
specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>                    (dims tank lights)
             The sun is going down, my
             nocturnal hunters. It's time to
             come out and feed.

Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.

<b>                          MIKE
</b>             Yeah. They're definitely getting
             bigger.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             I've calculated a growth factor of
             twelve percent over the last
             forty-eight hours. But that seems
             to be accelerating.

<b>                                                (CONTINUED)

</b><b>                                                           4.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                           MIKE
</b>             All from eating these bugs?   Maybe
             I should try some.

Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search
for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged
den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the
cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.

Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
insects.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             Run, little guys.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             They can't outrun the food chain.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             I could get away.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             Imagine yourself the size of that
             fly. A scytodes spitter would be
             as big as a Cadillac. You'd be
             spider chow, kid.

Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered
with a towel.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             Are the new tarantulas in here?

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             Took me forever to get a breeding
             set of Chilean reds. I must have
             bribed every customs agent from
             Vegas to Santiago.

Joshua unveils the    tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow
entrances. Joshua     pours in the bugs. A large, male
tarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,
then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a
mummy-like bundle.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             That is too cool.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             Male tarantulas compete for the
             female's attention.

</b>
<b>                           JOSHUA (CONT'D)
</b>             Each one tries to bring her the
             best present. Bugs, rats, even
             the occasional parrot.

<b>CHARLIE SQUAWKS.
</b>
<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             The prey is cocooned alive so she
             can eat them in her nest. You
             know how women love breakfast in
             bed.

Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas
scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             Take a look, the female of the
             species is three times as big as
             the male.

Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps
out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red
tarantula.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             Say hello to Consuela.

Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             She fills her prey with digestive
             acid to liquify the internal
             organs. Now watch... She'll drink
             her victim from the inside out.
             While it's still alive!

<b>                           MIKE
</b>                    (looks queasy)
             And you wonder why my mom doesn't
             like me hanging out with you.

<b>                           JOSHUA
</b>             Arachnids have been roaming the
             earth for millions of years. And
             they'll be here long after the
             human race is dead and buried.

Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.     Mike recoils.

<b>                            MIKE
</b>             Bad!   Bad Consuela!

Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.
<b>

</b>
<b>TARANTULA POV - MIKE
</b>
The multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms
large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.


<b>BACK TO MIKE
</b>
Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.

<b>                        MIKE
</b>          Do that again and I feed you to
          the parrot.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.    The sound of a CAR HORN.

<b>                        JOSHUA
</b>          There's your mom.

<b>                        MIKE
</b>          See you tomorrow, Joshua!

Mike heads for the door.


<b>EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.
A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the
door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,
<b>PROSPERITY, NV.
</b>

<b>INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY
</b>
Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a
string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of
the tunnel.

CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered
clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.

Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes
contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to
scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.

Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.

Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections
of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile
fades...

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>          Damn.

<b>                                              (CONTINUED)

</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's
sack lunch.

Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The
rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes
rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.

A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
with lunch.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>             Hope you like bologna!



<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
A police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the
trunk.


<b>INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY
</b>
SAMANTHA "SAM" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity
and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside
her.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>             You   should see them, Mom. Each
             one   has a unique feeding behavior.
             The   spitters fire poisonous snot.
             The   tarantulas mummify their prey.
             The   jumpers can...

<b>                           SAM
</b>             Why does he have all those things?

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             He studies them. NASA uses spider
             webs in outer space. And for
             medicine. They've been here
             forever, and they'll be here long
             after we're all dead.

<b>                           SAM
</b>             You're givin' me nightmares.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             Nightmares are cool.

<b>                           SAM
</b>             U.P.S. brought this to the
             station.

Sam hands Mike a small package.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             It's from Dad! He didn't forget
             my birthday. I told you he
             wouldn't.

<b>                           SAM
</b>             Better late than never.

Mike tears open the box to reveal a Cassiopeia PDA.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>             Rockin'!

<b>                           SAM

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of
             ram. Integrated modem. Voice
             recording capability. This baby
             is tight.

Mike can't turn on the gizmo.

<b>                             SAM
</b>             What's wrong?

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             He forgot to send the batteries.

<b>                           SAM
</b>                    (annoyed)
             I told him to send batteries.


<b>EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
The ROAR of two off-road MOTORCYCLES tearing up the
desert.

BRET HALE (18) leads the way. A Kid Rock-punk with good
looks and FU attitude. Seated behind him is ASHLEY
PALMER (16). This milk-fed desert honey is a wannabe
Britney Spears. LARRY (17) is the wiseacre on the other
bike.

<b>                           BRET

They GUN their BIKES onto the highway. Slalom the yellow
lines. Wheelie for days. Ashley peeks over Bret's
shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite
lane.

Sheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past.

<b>                           SAM
</b>             Hang on.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             Why?


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY
</b>
The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights
ablaze. SIREN WAILING. The bikes pull over to the
shoulder.


<b>EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY
</b>
The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind.        Sam's
voice barks over the PA.

<b>                           SAM (V.O.)
</b>             Party's over, gentlemen.   Off the
             bikes.

Sam exits the car and approaches.       The bikers dismount.

<b>                           BRET
</b>             There is something very sexy about
             an older woman in uniform.

<b>                           LARRY
</b>             Her nine-millimeter gives me a
             stiffy.

<b>                           ASHLEY
</b>             Don't antagonize her, you guys.

<b>                           SAM
</b>             I told you not to act like

             unacceptable, Bret.

Sam begins to write up the ticket.

Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance.

Chris's pickup approaches... The entire town is not much
bigger than a few football fields. The kind of place

At one end is the Prosperity Mall. A huge windowless
rectangle in the sand. Permanent signs tout the many
outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden
Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:

Jolt cola.

WADE HALE (40s) is the mayor of Prosperity. A slick-

last look before pulling out. Sam smiles with her
daughter.


<b>INT. MINING MUSEUM (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

Vintage mining gear. Walls covered with sepia-tone
photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines.

GLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke
from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner.
Ignoring the signs behind her head: "NO SMOKING!",
<b>"DANGER GAS!"
</b>
As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a
drawer.

</b>             I'm not proud of it.

Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that
honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked
"explored." Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel
off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys.
Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open
and puts out the flame.

She raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches.
Chris exits through a door at the back of the museum.

Chris enters the family living quarters. The furniture
was new in 1947. He continues to the adjacent kitchen.


<b>INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

Chris takes a beer out of the fridge. Then he notices an
odd CLICKING. He tracks the sound to a stove burner
permanently on "light."

Chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. He
removes the fuse for the stove. The SPARKING STOPS.

Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer.
Gladys enters with a stack of bills.

Joshua turns the radio down. He holds a tape measure to
a glass spider tank, recording the size of an unseen
arac.

</b>          An exponential growth rate...
          That's impossible.

Joshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its
perch.

<b>                        JOSHUA
</b>          Be quiet, bird!

Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching
curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if one
of the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over to
investigate. He lands on the counter and peers around
the back of the tank.

<b>                        CHARLIE
</b>          Charlie's in the wire!     Incoming!

Something yanks the parrot O.S.

<b>                        JOSHUA
</b>          Stop screwing around...!

Joshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices
several feathers floating down to the floor. He heads
over to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear to
reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. No
sign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side of
the tank.

<b>                        JOSHUA

She's nowhere to be seen. Joshua spots      something
sticking out from under the table. Two      parrot feet.
Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the     table. It's a
horrible sight. The bird is wrapped in      spider webbing.
His body desiccated.

under the table. His eyes go wide at what he sees. Then
a shadow looms over his head. Joshua looks up and...

Ashley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs
in.


<b>INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

Ashley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta
rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather
cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is
oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of
her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the
soap.

Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather
builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once
more. The spider returns across its web right in front
of her eyes.

The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead
blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no
water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching
with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has
landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the
spider scurries onto its opposite side.

Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the
washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can
strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.

The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the
beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on
the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it
was there.

Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks
the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again.
The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders
pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in
horror.

Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower
door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little
spiders.

Ashley just screams.

The SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of

furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur.

A cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching
something intently. The cat charges into the wall after
unseen prey.

EMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She
clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop.

Emma makes herself a hangover helper. Egg, tabasco,

food.

They hear FAINT MEOWING. Hank traces the source.       It's
coming from behind a partially-dismantled wall.

<b>                         HANK

wall. After a beat he hears the CAT RUSTLING around
inside.

Emma re-enters with a can of tuna.       She hears ZEKE HISS.

Hank shakes his head. The CAT noises become more

cat's progress. They tracks the sounds of BATTLE along
the wall. The noises become FRANTIC. SCRABBLING CLAWS.
HOWLS of KITTY pain.

They follow the cat's frenzied movement up the wall,
across the ceiling, and down the other wall. Hank
hurries over. He can feel his cat thrashing maniacally
on the other side. A FELINE SCREAM. And then deafening
silence.

Hank tears open the drywall, reaching for his cat.

Mike pays the man.

The annoyed Clerk points. Mike heads over. He sees the

remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off.


<b>EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY
</b>
Beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her
vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid
object is coughed up through the hose.

Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified
objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking
the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then
inexplicably stops.

Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of
the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now
she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks
deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage.

Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She
puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object
comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another.
And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and
into her mouth.

Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out
of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared.

Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She
vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small
spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches
them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream...
but can only retch.

Mike rides his bike into Joshua's front yard.    He
dismounts before the BIKE stops. It CRASHES.     Mike heads
inside.


<b>INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Mike stops short in the doorway. An off-hook TELEPHONE
BEEPS incessantly. WIND MOANS through shattered windows.
Furniture is tipped over. Mike moves through the chaos.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Hello?   Joshua? Charlie?

The spider tanks are shattered. No trace of their

recording.

          is broken glass everywhere.

Mike moves toward the back door of the cabin.    It swings
open and shut in the WIND.

Mike comes out and notices hundreds of coin-sized

wooden barricades labeled: "McCORMICK AND SONS MINING

             to be spiders. Could be rats.

Mike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to
the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too
dark.

Mike turns away and returns to the yard.    Never
realizing...

Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the
shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs
from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing.
Grisly.

Suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper
into the shaft by some unseen creature.

Chris works with   his pick-axe. He pauses, listening to a

roar? Chris isn'   t so sure. And then a new sound... a
SCREECHING. The    noise grows LOUDER. Something's coming.

Chris shines his light into the darkness. Trying to see
what's causing the unsettling crescendo...

Suddenly dozens of RATS burst from the darkness.

Chris runs out the mouth of the tunnel. The rat stampede
is on his tail. He leaps into the back of his pickup.

The trio steps to the fence.    Only three mangy ostriches
are there to greet them.

<b>                        WADE
</b>          My flock had fifty birds! Where'd

</b>          What about him?

<b>                         WADE

Sam talks to Wade.

larger:

Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance.
This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go
there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of
ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby.

Mike takes a closer    look. Something doesn't seem right.
An odd demarcation    in the soil. His fingers trace the
edge of a thin film    of material. It is a lid of sorts.
A sheath of sticky    webbing coated with dirt. Mike is
able to lift it.

             something with my life, Bret.
             Help people. Maybe med school is
             still an option.

They kiss. Things head toward a serious        level of "get
down." Bret slides his hand up Ashley's        shirt. Ashley
gets into it. But then Bret slides his        hand toward the
buttons of her 501s. Ashley removes his        hand.

<b>                              ASHLEY

Bret persists.       Ashley climbs off of him.

</b>             I thought you loved me.

             the good   girl. Let Daddy give you
             what you   really want.

Bret goes after her once more.      Ashley's not into it.

<b>                           ASHLEY
</b>             Please, Bret... Please don't...

But Bret won't listen. Ashley isn't strong enough to
fight him. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her
stun gun. She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the
trigger.

Bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. He
spasmodically jerks off of Ashley and tumbles out the
driver's side door.

Bret twitches on the ground.

Ashley watches from the truck.

</b>             I told you to back off!

Ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the
windows.

Bret is dazed as he gets to his feet. Then his eyes
rack-focus to a nearby dune. A Rottweiler-sized jumping
spider stands atop it. Two large eyes surrounded by six
smaller orbs. Orange and black designs on its abdomen.
Wiry hair. Dagger-sized fangs. Bret can't quite believe
what he sees.

Ashley STARTS the TRUCK.      This snaps Bret back to
reality.

<b>                             BRET

Bret sees the spider leisurely coming down off the dune.
He runs over to the door of the pickup and tries to open
it.

             embarrassing that is?

Ashley starts to pull away.         Bret keeps banging on the
glass.

Ashley flips him the bird and BURNS RUBBER. As the truck
moves out of the way, Bret finds himself staring at
several more jumping spiders that are methodically
approaching. Bret sprints around to the other side of
the truck stop.

Bret runs from behind the building.    Larry Witzer and a
bunch of other kids see him coming.

<b>                          RANDY
</b>            The only one coming is you, dude.

Larry and Randy high-five. A jumping spider lands on
Randy's back, piercing him with its fangs, throwing him
to the ground. Randy screams. The kids have a front-row
seat as the spider's pincers mash their buddy into an
edible pulp.

Bret leaps onto his MOTORCYCLE and FIRES it UP. Several
more jumping spiders bound across the parking lot.

<b>                           BRET
</b>            Ride!

The kids scramble, leaping onto their bikes. One rider
is picked off by a spider. The others kick up rooster
tails as they accelerate away. The spiders chase them
into the dunes.


<b>EXT. SAND DUNES - DAY
</b>
A wasteland on the outskirts of town. The sandy waves
are "surfed" by the noisy MOTORCYCLES. The jumping
spiders keep after them, leaping a dozen feet in a single
bound.

A biker is ripped off a motorcycle.     The BIKE CRASHES.

Larry ends up with a jumper on his bike. Another biker
tries to kick it off, managing to knock the critter into
the motorcycle's spokes. The spider gets munched. But
then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a
hungry jumper.

Larry continues riding. But a spider lands on his back
and sinks fangs into his spine. Larry yells bloody
murder.

Bret sees Larry go down in a cloud of gore and sand.
Bret is the only human left. A jumper comes after him in
mid-air. Bret does an X-Games style rocket air, kicking
backward with booted legs. He knocks the spider away and
keeps on riding.


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Three familiar trucks cruise down the highway.     This time
they are devoid of any toxic waste cargo.

splatter everywhere. Pig Pen screams as he JAMS on the

mine shaft.


<b>INT HORIZONTAL MINE SHAFT - DAY

Bret speeds inside. He looks over his shoulder to check
for his pursuers, they're gone. Bret looks relieved. He
faces forward as... whack! A support beam knocks him
from his bike. The bike continues on into the tunnel
alone. From the sound of things it travels pretty far
before crashing.

Bret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face.
He looks up at a support beam which begins to crack.
Bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in, sealing
him in the mine.

male tarantula on his back. Chris is oblivious as he
takes off his jacket. The coat lands in a heap atop the
spider.

Gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As
she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider
is about to strike, she goes another direction to get
spices, utensils, a pan.

Gladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the
tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her.
Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys
grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she
stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner
knobs, turning on the gas.

Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks
back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she
goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her.

Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the
webline prevents her from slotting it home.

Gladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the
fuse. She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see
the broken burner spark    to life. The gas ignites. The
tarantula is engulfed in    flame.

Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her
back when a second male tarantula nails her with a
webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the
floor toward the basement door.

The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly.

The museum burns. The volunteer fire department attacks
the conflagration. All the locals are there to help.

Sam's COP CAR SKIDS to a stop. Chris leaps out. Stares
at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward the
inferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him to
the ground.

The museum collapses.     Chris watches it burn to the
ground.


<b>EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)
</b>
The fire is out. The once-proud building is now a
smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups.

Chris wanders through the ruins as    firemen mop up. He
picks something out of the char.     The map of the mines.
Almost completely burned. Soaked     with water. He stares
at it for a heavy beat. All that     remains of his legacy.
Sam steps up.

Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.

Mike stands off to the side. He spots something near the

Mike hurries clear with his prize. He puts it on the

Chris stands by in shock. Watching, Upset.

</b>             Nothing happened, alright!

Ashley runs off to her room.       Sam follows.

Chris stands alone for a beat. He walks to the kitchen
and pulls a bottle of Vodka from the freezer. He puts
the cold bottle against his head and neck. Trying to
cool off.

Mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of
exoskeleton. He sees Chris opening the bottle of vodka.

Chris has another gulp of vodka as Mike holds up his
Cassiopeia full of spider data. He shows Chris a video

in amazement.

Prosperity is bathed in sunset. The mine shaft entrances

The garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes.

flannel shirt.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>             That one looks kind of scratchy.

Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it
and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt.

Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning
up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't
register Sam ogling his exposed chest.

Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals,
oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn't move. Ashley
grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. She
returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with
scissors.

The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it
moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos and
mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turns
around to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezes
momentarily.

Ashley sees her stun gun is on   the dresser. She lunges

lines of gummy web at Ashley.    The glop hits her int he
chest, carries her backward.    Glues her to the wall.

Chris stands weaponless before the spider.

side and rolls clear of a point-blank web shot.

Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He
looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the
spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung
across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of

<b>EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - PALMER HOUSE- NIGHT

Chris and Sam open the front door of the house.          Sam
looks one way. Chris the other.

No giant spiders lurking about. Chris and Sam continue
onto the lawn. Mike and Ashley watch from the safety of

Mike and Ashley move out of the doorway.          Joining the

The cop car cruises. The occupants peer out the windows.
Everything appears normal. Although no people are
visible.

Sam, Chris, and the kids move away from the cop car to

Wolf spiders crawl across rooftops. Spitters scale
buildings Tarantulas lurk in the shadows. Jumpers
scuttle out of the mineshafts. Trapdoors prepare their
burrows.

This funky old couple relaxes in their LaZee-Boys.

<b>                           SAM (V.O.)

The forelegs of a tarantula reach over the top of the
man's recliner, yanking him clean out. The woman is
oblivious as her husband is dragged away across the
floor.


<b>EXT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - NIGHT
</b>
Emma bursts out of the front door, screaming
hysterically. Hank is behind her with the SawzAll. A

Hank raises the saw, overextending the power cable.   He

A spider eats the chef. The waitress roller-skates away
from an arachnid. She jumps through the window into the
street.


<b>EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

A family piles into their mini-van. Oblivious to the
jumper hiding in the "way back." They close the door and
drive off.

Harlan has donned a vintage football helmet and pads.

Sam and the    others spill out of the trailer. They head
for the cop    car. As they get closer, a wolf spider
climbs onto    the car's roof and gnaws on the light bar.
Sam raises    her gun to blast it.

<b>                        MIKE

Sam leads the others toward town.


<b>EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Chris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids. Harlan brings
up the rear. The place is chaos. People are chased by
spiders. Dragged by spiders. Killed by spiders. Eaten
by spiders.

The group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters.    Suddenly
a familiar mini-van races past.

<b>                          HARLAN
</b>          Stop!    Take us with you!

Harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees...

The van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper.
The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to
pieces. The van crashes.


<b>EXT. POWER LINES (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - NIGHT
</b>
A group of orb weavers scurry across power lines. They
hit a transformer, shorting it out. The entire town is
suddenly plunged into darkness. Headlights. GUNFIRE.
Moonlight. Spotty illumination for the arachnids'
feeding frenzy.

A dumpster. The lid rises slightly. Wade Hale peers out
from within. He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the
wolf spider on top of it. The spider reaches down at
him.

<b>                            WADE
</b>          No!     Please!

The spider is suddenly BLOWN AWAY by Sam and Chris.      Wade
climbs out of the dumpster.

<b>                            WADE
</b>          Thank you!

Chris and Sam move on with the kids. Wade runs after
them. Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade.

<b>                            MIKE
</b>          You stink.

Chris gives Sam a funny look.       Maybe Gladys was right...


<b>EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Sam leads her group down toward the mall. Other groups
of survivors do likewise. As they get closer to the mall
the groups coalesce into one large pack. We recognize
Deputy Pete. Fireman Travis. The roller-skating
waitress. Floyd. Leroy. Hank. Emma. And many other
locals.


<b>EXT. DESERT (NEAR MALL) - NIGHT

Sam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their

Suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground. It
grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly
replacing the roof of its den. TRAVIS SCREAMS
underground.

nothing. They hear another MUFFLED SCREAM, and the top
of the spider's den pops up. Travis drags himself out of
it.

<b>                           TRAVIS
</b>             Help... me... please...

He is dragged back underground.

The group continues toward the mall entrance. Suddenly a
gun-toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor. He goes
cyclic, madly FIRING his GUN into the air as he's dragged
under.

More beasts rise out of their dens.       Reaching for the
humans.

<b>                             CHRIS
</b>             Keep going!

Chris and the others flee toward the mall.          Some of them
SHOOT at the spiders as they run.

Leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor. Floyd tries to help but
the spider plunges its fangs into poor Leroy, dragging
him under.

The group clears the trapdoor minefield. But some of the
spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after
them.

Chris and Sam and the kids lead just fifteen other
survivors to the glass doors. The doors are locked.
Wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them
desperately.

out of the gloom. He's staring at them all curiously.

<b>                          NORMAN

Sam points her gun at him.   Norman raise his hands in

chainsaw off the wall. Norman practices swinging a heavy
sledgehammer, accidentally toppling a stack of paint

The group looks up. The moon-cast shadow of the antenna
is visible on the skylights that run the length of the
mall.

<b>                           HARLAN

Wade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door. Sam
stands with her kids. Watching. Chris looks over his
shoulder for one last look. Sam runs up to him, gives
him the shotgun.

<b>INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

Wade leads Chris and Harlan up a tight staircase. The
door at the top is identified as "Roof Access." Wade
reaches the door. The others bunch up behind him.

They sneak across the roof toward the base of the
antenna.

Harlan starts climbing. Chris stands guard at the
bottom. Neither of them sees the horde of spiders
climbing up the side of the building toward the roof.

Mike collects perfume. Packing it into his pockets like
grenades. Ashley is nearby, checking out the lingerie.

The kids run out to join their mom.       After they go...

The grill of an air vent is pushed open. A huge spitting
spider pushes its way through. Dropping to the floor.
Another spider follows.

Harlan is high up on the antenna. He has a cell phone in
hand. It still indicates: "NO SERVICE." He keeps

Sam gazes up at the skylight. She can see the silhouette
of Chris and Harlan climbing the antenna. Pursued by
spiders.

them.

He faces off against more spiders coming through the Home
and Garden store.


<b>EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT
</b>
Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders
are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNS
DRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approaching
arac.

A spider fires a web at Harlan.       Nails the poor guy.   And
drags him off the antenna.

Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders.
Chris reaches out and grabs him. Holding Harlan's hand.

<b>                             CHRIS
</b>             I've got you!

Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris.       They're both about
to be killed unless...

Harlan jerks away from Chris's hand. He cannonballs down
into the horde of spiders. Splattering several of the
beasts along with himself.

Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac
and climbs even higher. He pulls out his machete and
begins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antenna
upright.

The spiders close in. Chris slices one wire. The
antenna quivers. Chris slices another wire. The antenna
shakes.

Deputy Pete is standing with Sam and the kids when he's

Sam FIRES the GUNS like Annie Oakley, putting spiders
down left and right, trying to reach her kids.

Floyd the barber confronts a spider with his chain-saw.

<b>                           FLOYD

Chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight.
The antenna keels over. Chris hangs tight as he drops
toward the glass.


<b>INT. MALL - NIGHT
</b>
Sam looks up to   see Chris come crashing down through the
skylight on the   antenna. The antenna tilts in at a sixty
degree angle.    Chris hangs off the end. Orb weavers ride
their weblines   down to the floor of the mall.

Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. He sees a
hundred spiders coming in on webs. Flooding out of the
stores. The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere!

<b>                               MIKE

down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the
bottom. Sam runs to his side.

The waitress roller-skates away from the spiders. She
slaloms clear of several spitters. But gets tackled by a
jumper.

Ashley starts to move out   of the tube. She discovers the
end has been covered with   web. She pushes it. Something
on the other side pushes   back. Ashley scrambles back.
Mike is already moving.    The kids flee through the tubes
to get away.

             the last one!

They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a
spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume
grenades at the spider, covering their retreat.

Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes.
Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers.

<b>                           MIKE

Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide.

She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider
looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But
it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the
arachnid clear.

Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam

Emma runs parallel to them across the playground's
sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider.

Hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his
tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand.

Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his
chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry
spider descends on him from above and knocks him to the
floor.

Chris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s.    He
stops for a moment to look at the jeans.

Chris continues on.

All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and
prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all
directions.

Mike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT.
Others use their make-shift weapons.

Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it.    Mike sees this
and gets an idea.

Norman opens    an access door. Sam and the other survivors

The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.

Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and
spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through the
opening.

<b>INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b>
Bret runs past Sam and Chris. Sam FIRES her SHOTGUN at
the first spider that enters the tunnel. Her GUN CLICKS
DRY. She un-holsters her PISTOLS and FIRES.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>          Cover me!

<b>                        SAM
</b>          What are you going to do?!

Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper
support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. Sam
FIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.

<b>                           SAM
</b>          Hurry!

Sam's GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the
machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attacking
spiders.

Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of
dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for an
awkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...

<b>                        SAM

They manage to disengage and move on.

Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
remaining survivors.

<b>INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT
</b>
A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD
SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file
into a slightly more open area with two branching
tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with
barrels of toxic waste.

<b>                        CHRIS
</b>          I don't believe it...

Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the
barrel in the drainage ditch.

<b>                        MIKE

Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.

Sam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground.

Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others
follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after
them.


<b>INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b>
Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across
bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs
runs along the roof into both tunnels.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>             One end of these lights should be
             connected to a generator. That'll

They continue down the tunnel.     Entering...

A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.
Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.

Norman swallows his glowing joint.

Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.

</b>             That's what I was talking about,

</b>             So the female's around here?

Bret looks around nervously.

The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a
horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh
balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.
He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid
drained away.

Mike hides his eyes.     Ashley comforts him.

<b>                           SAM
</b>             That one just moved!

Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete.       The
web comes away to reveal a human hand.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>             There's somebody in here!

Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.
They finally reveal Gladys.

The woman's body begins to spasm.

Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.
Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.

<b>                             CHRIS
</b>             It's okay.    It's okay.

Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.
From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.

Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the
cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The
reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the
cavern walls.

Bret looks at Ashley.

Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade.           Sam

The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows.

<b>                           NORMAN
</b>             What's the big deal?

Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his
boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.
Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the
squashed bodies.

<b>                           MIKE

Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.

Chris reacts to the noise.    He can guess what's coming...

The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela
has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far
the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair.
Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.

Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             Consuela.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>             Consuela?

The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is
something weird there. A lot of weird things. In
fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
tarantulas.

As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized
quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain
spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.

<b>                           NORMAN
</b>             Bummer...

Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him
tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,
chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>             Go!

The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.        A
male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam
BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away
bits of gold.

nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms
behind him.

him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's
chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings
Wade into the cave.

<b>                              CHRIS

Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing
more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret
leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.

Ashley goes to his side.

</b>
Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running.


<b>INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT
</b>
Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula. Sam stumbles
over something on the ground. It's Bret Hale's lost
motorcycle. Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula
coming after them.

<b>                           ASHLEY
</b>             Hurry!

Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She
STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam
accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The
bike's headlight illuminates their path.

The male tarantula scurries after the bike.

Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs
on tight. They've put some distance between themselves
and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.
Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.

Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward
the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's
shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite
direction.

<b>                           ASHLEY
</b>             Oh shit.

Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears.

<b>                             SAM
</b>             Banzai!

With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard
onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is
roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel.


<b>EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN
</b>
Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the
tunnel exit. Mike tries to start the generator. It
won't catch.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>             It needs gas!

<b>                           GLADYS
</b>             There's a ranch!

Gladys heads over toward Wade's ranch.


<b>INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN
</b>
Chris runs along the tunnel. Consuela charges after him,
Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs.


<b>EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN
</b>
Mike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the
motorcycle.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>             It needs gas!

Sam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of
the tank. It's clear this is not going to work.

<b>                             ASHLEY
</b>             Hurry!


<b>INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN
</b>
Chris runs.     Smashing light bulbs.   Consuela close
behind.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>             Start the generator!
<b>
</b><b>                                                     92.

<b>                          ASHLEY
</b>          Hurry, Mom!

Sam has dumped some fuel into the generator.   She tries
to start it. It won't turn over.


<b>INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN
</b>
Chris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him.   He keeps
going.


<b>INT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - DAWN
</b>
Sam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel. She tries to
start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate.

<b>                        CHRIS
</b>          Throw the switch!

<b>                        SAM
</b>          I don't have any power!

<b>                          ASHLEY
</b>          Yo, Mom!

Sam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN. Sam catches
it and brings it down to the light bulb cable... ZAPPING
it.


<b>INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN
</b>
As Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially,
traveling past him into the cavern.


<b>INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN
</b>
A broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the
gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout
the mines.


<b>INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN
</b>
A huge column of flame blasts into the chamber. All the
gold is illuminated. Consuela's babies are burned like
popcorn.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           93.
</b>
<b>EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY
</b>
Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her. Consuela
is on his heels. The glow of a fireball is right behind
them.

<b>                          SAM
</b>          Come on!

Chris looks over his shoulder at Consuela and the flames.

<b>                          SAM
</b>          Chris!

Chris makes it to Sam just ahead of the conflagration.


<b>EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY
</b>
Sam and Chris dive out of the mine opening. A pillar of
flame shoots out behind them.   Ashley and Mike are
nearby. The town is visible just a mile away.


<b>EXT. TOWN - DAY
</b>
The spiders retreat from daylight. Scuttling back into
the buildings. Heading down into the mine shafts.


<b>INT. VARIOUS MINE TUNNELS - DAY
</b>
The chain reaction spreads through the mines.      Jets of
flame blast up tunnels.

Torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home.
Rupturing the very earth around them.


<b>EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY
</b>
The EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.

<b>                          ASHLEY
</b>          Earthquake!

<b>                        CHRIS
</b>          No! It's a chain reaction! The
          whole valley is going to blow!

<b>                        MIKE
</b>          We'll never get out in time!

Gladys drives up in     Wade's humvee.   Cigar in mouth.

<b>CONTINUED:

<b>                           GLADYS
</b>             Let's get the fuck out of here!

The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to
BLOW UP in the distance.

Chris is just about to climb aboard when... A webline
shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives!
The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for
revenge.

Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her.            He
fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline.
Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
Consuela's fangs.

Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at
him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela
begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred
carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor.
He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually
helping it!

Mike and the others watch from the humvee.

<b>                           MIKE
</b>             Oh no... she's molting!

Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see
the spider has grown a full size larger and become
totally rejuvenated!

Consuela comes after Chris.        He defends himself with the
machete.

Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.
Once again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares
the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.

<b>                               MIKE
</b>             Consuela!   No!     Bad!   Bad
             Consuela!

The massive spider stops in shock.            Chris looks back to
see Mike has returned.


<b>TARANTULA POV
</b>
The familiar multi-perspective spider vision.            The
tarantula seems to recognize Mike.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       95.
</b>
<b>BACK TO MIKE
</b>
He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spider's face...

Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete
and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected
abdomen...

The tarantula screams.

Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike.   They dive
into the back of the humvee.

Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. She
collapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g.
The earth itself begins to collapse.


<b>INT. HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY
</b>
Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance.
BUILDINGS EXPLODE. Jets of flame burst upward. The mall
is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth. The
humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling
desert.


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
The humvee reaches open road. The survivors watch out
the back as Prosperity disappears into a massive
sinkhole.


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY
</b>
The group sits in a long beat of abject shock. And then
Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally
ripped.

<b>                        CHRIS
</b>          I really need some pants that fit.

The group smiles.    Happy to be alive.

<b>                          MIKE
</b>          Look out!

Everyone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny
rabbit hops across the highway. Gladys HONKS and swerves
to avoid it.


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward
safety.

The rabbit continues its trek for a moment, and then is
grabbed by a large trap-door spider.
