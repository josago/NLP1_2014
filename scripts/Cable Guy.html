<b>1	FULL FRAME - WHITE NOISE
</b>
Credits begin. The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint 
image of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly 
image.

The camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch 
television.

The camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote
control. The hand changes channels frantically.

The camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty
years old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception.
Unfortunately for him – his cable is not hooked up.

<b>STEVE
</b>(looks at watch)
Jesus, where's the cable guy already?

<b>END OF CREDIT SEQUENCE
</b>
<b>1A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
It is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just 
moved in. The phone rings.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(into the phone)
Hello.

<b>2	NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
We see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough 
looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television 
set.

ON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic 
on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update."

<b>RICK
</b>How's the move going?

<b>3	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Steven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Horrible. The cable guy is missing in
action. Apparently he's going to be here
sometime between eight AM and my death.

<b>RICK
</b>You haven't called Robin have you?
Please tell me you didn't call her.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(sarcastically)
No, I'm giving her space.
(beat)
I can't believe she's doing this.

<b>RICK
</b>You never should have asked her to marry
you. You're the mad smotherer.

<b>STEVEN
</b>All she had to do was say no. She didn't
have to kick me out. I feel like Felix
Unger.

<b>RICK
</b>You forced her to evaluate the
relationship. If you didn't propose she
would never have realized how unhappy she
was.

<b>STEVE
</b>I don't want to talk about it.
So what time are you going to come by?

<b>RICK
</b>I can't. I'm working double shifts the
rest of the week.

<b>STEVEN
</b>It's my first night here. Don't do this
to me.

<b>RICK
</b>The other camera guy pulled out his back.
Besides, I spent the last two weeks with
you on my couch. Isn't that enough?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Fine, fine.

<b>RICK
</b>One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy
fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie
channels for free. Even the dirty ones.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff.
What if he says no? I'll feel like an
idiot.

<b>RICK
</b>None of them say no, believe me. I'll
talk to you later.

Steven hangs up, and waits.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>4	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
Steven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his 
ex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it 
back in the box.

<b>4A	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
Establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck 
pulls into a gated side garage.

<b>5	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
Movers deliver a small breakfast table and chairs. Steven directs them as to where to put them.

<b>CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 3:52 P.M.
</b>
<b>6	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
Steven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception. He changes channels. Still 
nothing. He pulls it off frustrated.

<b>7	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
Many of the boxes are gone. Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting. He is unable 
to fill his day without cable.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Where the hell is he?

<b>8	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
Steven paces back and forth across the room. He stares at his watch frequently.

<b>CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 5:12 P.M.
</b>
<b>9	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
Steven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen. He looks at the clock. It says five-thirty. He 
picks up the phone and dials. A machine picks up.

<b>ROBIN (VO)
</b>Hi, this is Robin. Leave a message. If
you are trying to reach Steven he can now
be reached at 555-3837.

Steven hangs up.

<b>10	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SUNSET
</b>
Steven does sit ups. He looks at the clock.

<b>CLOSE UP OF THE CLOCK - 6:48 P.M.
</b>
<b>STEVEN
</b>(to himself)
Forget it. Idiots.

He gets up, and walks into the bathroom.

<b>11	INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Steven gets undressed. He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in. He tries to lose his 
tension by letting the hot water engulf him. He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair.

<b>THE DOORBELL RINGS
</b><b>STEVEN
</b>(annoyed)
Oh great.

<b>THE DOORBELL RINGS SEVERAL TIMES
</b>
Steven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Don't leave! I'm here! I'm here!

<b>12	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Steven runs to the door.

<b>CABLE GUY (OS)
</b>Hello! Cable Guy!

Steven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole.

<b>P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE
</b>
The CABLE GUY is walking away.

<b>INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Steven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey, wait!

The Cable Guy turns back.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Well, look who decided to show up. I was
just gonna go collect my retirement
pension.

The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he 
speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You were supposed to be here four hours
ago.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to
know.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath
place, but now it's closed.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>
(turns to leave)
Maybe I shouldn't have come at all – jerk
off!
(turns back smiling)
I'm just joking. Let's do this.
(looks around)
Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought
they'd get the floors clean after what
happened here.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What happened?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(long beat)
They had a lot of cats.

They walk into Steven's living room.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a
comment card.

He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Please mail it in when I am done.

<b>STEVEN
</b>These go to your boss?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>No, they go to me. I'm a
perfectioniss… perfectioniss…
(he strains to lose his lisp)
perfectioniss…t.
Now let's take a look at what we're
dealing with.

The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me
baby. Tell me where you like it. That's
it baby.

He zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Here's your sweet spot.

He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>So your lady kicked you out.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>In preparing your service I noticed you
were previously wired across town at 1268
and a half Chestnut. Last week the
billing was transferred to one Robin
Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I really don't want to talk about it with
you. Could you please just install my
cable? I'm going to get dressed.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>No sweat.

Steven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I
can access the floorboards. Don't be
spooked if you hear someone crawling
underneath you.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Okay, whatever.

Steven walks toward his bedroom.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be
channel surfing in no time.

The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.

<b>13	INT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
<b>CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION
</b>
RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio.

<b>RIKKI KLIEMAN
</b>(to camera)
So ends day fifty-four of the trial of
former child star Sam Sweet who has been
accused of shooting his twin brother,
Stan, in cold blood. The twins were
stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble"
which aired from nineteen seventy-seven
till nineteen eighty-four.

A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at 
various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year-
old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad.

We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of 
Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.

<b>RIKKI KLIEMAN
</b>(to camera)
Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation
of their program. Hollywood chewed them
up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam
turned to petty larceny, while his more
impressionable brother, Stan, fell in
with a fringe cult called "The
Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to
tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside
of Sam. A burning need to be recognized
as an individual, not a person famous for
having an identical twin. A need that
took the form of four shotgun blasts on
the night of November fourteenth. And so
today his attorneys continue the unusual
defense of "Twin Envy."

<b>ANGLE ON
</b>
Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.

<b>STEVEN
</b>How's it going?

The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I
hope they fry this bastard.

Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the 
room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs 
blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation 
impossible.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(looks around)
What happened?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(jumps to his feet)
The arrangement of your major appliances
and your furniture was causing some noisy
pics and hum bars in your reception. I
moved a few things. Cleared it right up.
Is that cool?

<b>STEVEN
</b>(non-confrontational)
I… guess so.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You programmed?
(off of Steven's look)
Then let me slave your remotes.

He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at 
each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Ooh, maybe we should leave these two
alone.

<b>STEVEN
</b>So after this I'll only need one remote
for everything?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You know you're pretty good at this. You
could be a cable guy yourself.
(he finishes)
Now let me check your levels.

With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he 
clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving 
kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>All right. That about does it. I just
have some paperwork for you to fill out.
Sign here.

Steven does.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>That gave me power of attorney over you.
(beat)
Joking.

Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too 
long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want 
to leave.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm about finished here.
(beat)
Okay. I feel good about this.

Cable Guy walks to the door.

<b>STEVEN
</b>One thing.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(turns back immediately)
Yeah!

<b>STEVEN
</b>I… uh… I have this friend and he said
he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he
got free movie channels. Have you ever
heard of anything like that?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(deadly serious)
You mean illegal cable?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Uh… yes.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Who told you that? I want his name.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Forget it.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You're offering me a bribe? What you
have just done is illegal, and in this
state if convicted, you could be fined
five-thousand dollars or spend six months
in a correctional facility.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Please… that was dumb. I was just
making conversation –

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(laughs)
I'm just jerking your chain. Wake up
little snoozy. I'll juice you up. All
it is is a push of a button.

He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Oh, great. How much?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge
you. Your girl just booted you.
Consider it one guy doing another guy a
solid.

<b>STEVEN
</b>That is so nice.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be
surprised how many customers treat you
like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or
something.
(hands him a card)
Here is my personal beeper number. It's
just for my preferred customers. Never
call the company, they'll just put you on
hold.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Thanks. Really.
(holds up comment card - jokes)
You're gonna get some good marks here.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Maybe some day I'll take you out to the
satellite and show you how all this stuff
works. It's really incredible.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Sure. We should do that one day.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>How 'bout tomorrow?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>What are you going to do, sit home and
stew about your ex?

<b>STEVEN
</b>No.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(insulted)
Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line.
Sorry.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(guilty)
You didn't cross the line.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty.
On the flip side.

The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into 
that.

(End Revision - Pink)

<b>14	INT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
Steven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks 
impressed.

Steven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex.

<b>STEVEN
</b>…There are twenty-four classrooms; each
can be converted into a 1400 square foot
home. The facility has two tennis courts,
an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a
stage if the residents decide they want
to perform "Oklahoma."

Everyone laughs. Steven is very good at his job.

<b>STEVEN
</b>The kitsch appeal of living in an old
schoolhouse should be very attractive to
young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And
most important, the structure is
available in foreclosure. If we put down
a cash bid, we're going to steal this
thing.

There is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm 
around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up.

<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling
good?

<b>STEVE
</b>Yeah.

<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>Did I hear something about you having
some troubles at home?

<b>STEVE
</b>Robin and I have been having a difficult
time. I moved out, but I really think
it's only temporary.

<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a
big mother. Know what I mean? If it
fails, corporate's going to have my ass.
I've got confidence in you, but you hear
where I'm coming from, bro?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Absolutely. Now I've got more time than
ever. It's a good thing.
(laughs)
I know I can pull this thing off.

<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>(playfully)
Then what are you doing talking to me?
You've got a lot of work to do. Get to
it!

<b>STEVEN
</b>Thank you. I will.

Hal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, 
<b>JOAN.
</b>
<b>STEVEN
</b>I'll be right back.

<b>14A	INT. SASSY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY
</b>
Steven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office.

<b>15	OMITTED
</b>
<b>16	INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY
</b>
ROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at "Sassy Magazine." 
Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are 
papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has 
written.

Steven peeks his head in her door.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hello.

Robin's face drops.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Steven, what are you doing here?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop
by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush
article come out?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

<b>ROBIN
</b>They liked it.
(beat)
I thought we agreed we weren't going to
see each other for a month.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I know, it's just Daniels accepted my
proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.

<b>ROBIN
</b>That's wonderful, congratulations.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I know I'm breaking the rules, but come
have dinner with me tonight to celebrate.

<b>ROBIN
</b>I don't think we should.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Come on, this is the biggest day of my
career.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Don't put me in this position.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What position? I want to share this with
you.

<b>ROBIN
</b>(feeling pressured)
I love you, but I need to take some time
on my own to see how I feel. You agreed
to this. I mean… this is exactly why we
broke up, because you never listen to me.

<b>STEVE
</b>What? Now we're broken up? What
happened to 'trial separation?'

<b>ROBIN
</b>I can't get into this now. If you haven't
noticed, I'm at work.

<b>STEVE
</b>Sorry to disturb you.

He turns to leave.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

<b>ROBIN
</b>(sincerely)
Steven. Congratulations. I know how
much this means to you. You deserve it.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Thanks.

He leaves.

<b>17	OMITTED
</b>
<b>17A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M.
</b>
Steven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never 
stopping for more than a second.

He hears a horn honking outside.

<b>CABLE GUY (OS)
</b>Steven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let's go!!!!

ON THE TV - A commercial for Medieval Times Restaurant.

Steven walks over to the window and sees The Cable Guy standing in front of his van, leaning in 
his window honking the horn.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Steven!!!!
(waves)
Hey buddy!!! Come on down!!!

Steven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the 
television.

ON THE TV - The local news.

<b>REPORTER
</b>Coming up next a special report,
"Loneliness, America's Silent Killer."

Steven looks back out the window and sees the Cable Guy smiling and waving for him to come 
down.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(begins walking to the door)
What the hell.

<b>18	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK
</b>
Steven walks from his apartment to the customized van. On the side of the white van it says, "The 
Cable Company - Get Wired Today."

<b>STEVEN
</b>How's it going?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Howdy partner. Climb aboard.

Steven gets in.

<b>19	INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The van drives onto the main boulevard.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Thanks for coming out. You know most
people think cable is just a simple co-ax
that comes out of the wall. They never
take the time to understand how it works.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Where exactly are we goin?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>We're going to take a ride on the
information superhighway.

<b>20	EXT. CITY - DUSK
</b>
Birds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>…It all started in Lansford,
Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable
television system.

The van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain, 
overlooking the entire city.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable
Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.

<b>21	EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK
</b>
Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I come here to think sometimes. To clear
my head.

They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a 
one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's 
controls are located.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>There she is. Right now she's sending
entertainment and information to millions
of satisfied citizens.

<b>STEVEN
</b>That's pretty impressive.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>See, I knew the moment I met you that
you would appreciate this.

The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(with wonder)
The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television,
phone, and computer. You'll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel, and
watch female mud wrestling on
another. You can do your shopping at
home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend
in Vietnam. There's no end to the
possibilities.
(waves to Steven)
Come on up! What are you waiting for?!

<b>22	INT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT
</b>
The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that
there are billions of bits of information
surging through me.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I
guess I've always taken it for granted.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>When I was a kid my mom worked nights.
Never met dad. But the old TV was always
there for me.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I know what you mean. My dad was there,
but he might as well have been gone. My
mom is a stewardess. She was always out
of town.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(moved)
That's tough. You must have a lot of
abandonment issues. Reality isn't "Father
Knows Best," it's a kick in the face on
Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

<b>STEVEN
</b>(tentative)
You know my brother's a speech therapist.

The Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>So?

There is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Never mind.

The Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(beat)
So, you're pretty love struck about your
lady, huh?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and
she asked me to move out.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I hate that.

<b>STEVEN
</b>She said she felt pressured. Can you
believe that?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I
don't think you listen to her. I think
you try to tell her what she wants to
hear. She wants you to thirst for
knowledge about who she is. All the
complicated splendor that is woman. When
your love is truly giving, it will come
back to you ten-fold.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You're right. That is remarkably
insightful.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final
thought on Friday's show.

<b>23	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
</b>
The van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You know what? Women are suckers for
"Sleepless in Seattle." It's on HBO this
month. That's your bait right there.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Robin loves that movie.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>They all do. Next time you talk to her
tell her you're cooking yourself dinner,
and watching it by yourself. Sound like
you're happier than a pig in shit.
She'll come running. Betcha. Then just
play it cool.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Maybe I will.

Steven gets out of the car.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say
this, but I don't know your name. What
is it?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(touched)
You really want to know my name? You do?
Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my
friends call me Chip.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'll see ya' Chip.

Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Let's just remember right now. You know
some people walk through their entire
lives and never find a true friend.
(long pause)
I guess we're the lucky ones.

(End Revised - Pink)

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Uh… good-bye.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the
flip side.

Steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable.

<b>24	INT. COFFEEHOUSE - NEXT DAY
</b>
Steven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I don't listen to you. I pretend to
understand but I'm really just saying
what I think you want to hear. So from
now on I'm going to try my best to listen
more because I do love you and am
interested in learning about every detail
about the complicated splendor that is
you.

Robin looks at him, somewhat shocked.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Oh.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I want us to get back together, but I can
see why taking this time might be good
for us. So, I'm not mad.

After a long beat, Robin smiles.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Sometimes time apart is healthy.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You're right. Well, that's what I came
here to say. Look, I've got to get back
to the office.

He starts getting up.

<b>ROBIN
</b>So, are you doing anything tomorrow?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm just going to cook myself dinner and
watch a movie. "Sleepless in Seattle" is
on cable.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Really?

<b>STEVEN
</b>If you're around you should drop by and
check out the new apartment.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Okay, maybe I will.

He exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case.

ON MTV - Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table. TABITHA SOREN is giving the news 
update.

<b>TABITHA SOREN
</b>Today in the Sam Sweet case the
prosecution played the 911 call that Sam
Sweet made the night he murdered his
brother. Keep in mind, he confessed one
month later.

The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen.

<b>SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE
</b>(crying and babbling)
Hello, please send help. My twin brother
has been shot.

<b>911 OPERATOR
</b>Slow down sir. What happened?

<b>SAM SWEET
</b>Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun
four times. I mean I think it was a
shotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I
think it was an Asian gang or something.
They were speaking some other language.

Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.

<b>TABITHA SOREN
</b>Hmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a rare
interview with Michael Jackson's zoo-
keeper.

<b>25	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
</b>
Steven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, 
but friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Here, here, here.

A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.

<b>RICK
</b>(to himself)
Shit! My fault! My fault!

<b>STEVEN
</b>Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There
is no stopping me today.

Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who 
catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The 
ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it 
hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the 
Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I
was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd
run the court for a couple of innings.

<b>RICK
</b>(gestures to injured player)
Great. We need another man.

<b>STEVEN
</b>This is… Chip Douglas… my cable guy.

Rick smiles in recognition.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>We met about a week ago during a routine
installation, but I feel like I've known
him my whole life.

Steven can't believe this is happening.

<b>RICK
</b>Oh really. That's sweet. All right Chip
Douglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm
skins.

The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he 
is rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is 
scary.

<b>JEFF
</b>I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just
play.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up.

The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone 
stares at him until he finishes.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Let's get it on!

<b>STEVEN
</b>Are you any good?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Feed me under the boards and you'll find
out.

Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as 
humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. 
He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot 
which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(doing the traveling hand signal)
Traveling! That's traveling!

<b>RICK
</b>Yeah, whatever you say Chip.

Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>All right, so we're playing that type of
game. Prison rules. I get it.

Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss 
crosses all over the court.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm
open!

Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the 
process. The ball goes in.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(does the foul hand signal)
And one! That's definitely a foul!
(to Jeff)
You want to mug me, my wallet is in my
other pants.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(to Cable Guy)
What are you doing?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Don't play from fear Steven. We can take
these guys.

<b>MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V.
</b>
a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it 
down.
b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including 
Rick.
c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. 
The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders 
with Rick.
d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down 
hard.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Take it to the hole!

Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs 
his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the 
ground. The ball does not go in.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, are you okay?

He pulls Steven up.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Yeah. I'm fine.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Let's switch. I'll cover Rick.

The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare.

Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to 
the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.

<b>RICK
</b>(enraged)
What the hell was that? That's it. I've
had enough.

Everyone begins to exit the court.

<b>JEFF
</b>Thanks for bringing your "friend".

The Cable Guy runs up to Rick.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Good game.
(slaps Rick on the butt)
You were tough out there. Your play
brought me up to a higher level. I mean
that.

<b>RICK
</b>(dismissive)
Yeah.

He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What are you doing?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>It was payback time. I was protecting
you.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

<b>STEVEN
</b>You ruined the game.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I don't appreciate your tone Steven.
That's not the way friends speak to each
other.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What are you talking about? I don't even
know you!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Well let's fix that. Let me buy you a
Heineken?

<b>STEVEN
</b>No, I'm going home.

Steven turns to leave.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've
got to go shower up and do some stuff.
I'll call you if I get a chance. Or you
call me… or something.

The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the 
cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>And down low.

Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven 
gives him a low five just so he can leave.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(pulls his hand away so Steven misses it)
Too slow. Have a good one.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(as he walks away)
Yeah, have a good one.

<b>26	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT
</b>
Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of 
wine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message 
machine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

<b>MESSAGE VOICE
</b>You have eleven messages.

<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER
</b><b>(ON THE MACHINE)
</b>Steven, it's mom. Give me a call. I'm
still your mother.

<b>STEVEN'S FATHER
</b><b>(ON THE MACHINE)
</b>I'm getting on. Steven call your mother.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b><b>(ON THE MACHINE)
</b>Hey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a
ring. I'm at 555-4329.
(beep)
What's up Steven? I'm at a pay phone. If
you're there pick up. Pick up. Pick up.
Okay, I'll be home later. I'll talk to
you then.

Steven stops chopping.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b><b>(ON THE MACHINE)
</b>(beep)
Okay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when
you get in. I'll be here pretty much all
night. Bye.
(beep tone)
Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a
call when you get a chance.
(beep tone)
I was just taking a whiz, thought you
might have called. Okay later.
(beep tone)
Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to
it, thought it might have been you. All
right, bye.

Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the 
rest of the calls.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(fast forwards)
…We're having ourselves quite a little
game of phone tag here. You're it!
(fast forwards)
…I was just blow drying my hair and I
thought I heard the phone ringing.
(fast forwards)
…you're a tough man to reach.
(fast forwards)
I guess you're too busy to call your
friends.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then –

<b>CABLE GUY
</b><b>(ON THE MACHINE)
</b>(long beat - then quiet and distant)
Shit.

The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed 
casually, but looks beautiful.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey, good to see you.

There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Come on in. What do you think of the
place?

She looks at the odd placement of furniture.

<b>ROBIN
</b>You made some interesting choices laying
out the room.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(embarrassed)
That's actually where the movers put the
furniture. I'm gonna change it, very 
soon.

<b>ROBIN
</b>No, I like it.

<b>27	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
The food is all eaten. Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation.

<b>ROBIN
</b>So how's work?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Work's good.

<b>ROBIN
</b>How's Hal?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Don't get me started. That guy has no
vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.
He's just worthless.

<b>ROBIN
</b>It's just great that you're getting to do
it. It's a real step up.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I
could really get some stuff done.

<b>ROBIN
</b>It's nice to see you doing so well.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Well, it's nice just to see you.
(looks at his watch)
Hey, it should be starting.

They sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The 
screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the 
signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.

<b>ROBIN
</b>It's alright. We can watch it another
night.

<b>STEVEN
</b>No, no. We really should see it now.
Now's a good time.

He plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Wait, wait. I know what to do.

He walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials 
it, then presses the number in.

<b>STEVEN
</b>The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll
just page him. We'll have this fixed in
no time.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

Steven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing –

<b>THERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR
</b>
Steven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and 
disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled.

<b>STEVEN
</b>That was… fast.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Is there a problem with your service?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Yeah… my cable went out.

Steven pushes him out into the hall.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Really?

The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>So you called me. Interesting how you
call when you need something. Is that how
you treat people?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I've been really busy. You've got to get
my cable going, Robin is here. This is
really important.

He peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back 
out.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>But calling me back isn't?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Why should I help you? I gave you free
cable. What have you ever done for me?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Anything you want. Name it – quickly.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Tomorrow night, we hang out.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Fine, whatever you want.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>God bless you. You're too good to me.

The Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(loud-normally)
All set.

<b>STEVEN
</b>So what's with the cut cord?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(nonchalantly)
That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow
Steven.
(conspiratorially)
She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't
even touch her. Fight the urge at all
costs. It will pay off later with…

He makes a motion which implies sex.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Enjoy the flick.

The Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Who was that?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Nobody.

Steven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy.

<b>28	ON THE TV
</b>
A scene from the film "Sleepless in Seattle."

The camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van – alone. 
We cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we 
can tell that he lives there.

<b>29	(SCENE 29 OMITTED)
</b>
<b>30	EXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK
</b>
The Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of
a weird mood. How'd things go with you?
Keep 'em closed.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the
other night. I didn't appreciate you --

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Don't peek. I want this to be a
surprise.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I really don't need to be surprised.
Where are we going?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Only the best restaurant in town.

They walk around a corner.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Okay, here we are. Open sesame.

Steven opens his eyes.

The camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which 
says "MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT."

<b>STEVEN
</b>Medieval Times?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I know what you're thinking. Don't
worry, I'm buying.

<b>31	INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER
</b>
The Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular 
arena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed 
decor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc.

(Revision Ends - Pink)

<b>STEVEN
</b>Funny. I never thought I would ever
come here.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I love this place. I come here twice a
week.

A Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by. The Cable Guy is transfixed.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Oh man, that's my look. I love big
butts. Ow, that hurts.

He grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>There oughta be a law. Man she is hot.
It's just not fair.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(gestures to him squeezing his crotch)
Please don't.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You know what I need right now? Pooooon
tang. And I'm not talking about the
place in Vietnam.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Good to know.

They sit down. The WAITRESS walks over. She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not 
enthusiastic about her job.

<b>WAITRESS
</b>(flatly)
Welcome to Medieval Times. My name is
Melinda. I'll be your serving wench.
May I get you something from the bar
keep?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(too into it)
Dost thou have a mug of ale for me
and me mate? He has been pitched in
battle for a fortnight an has a King's
thirst for the beer thust thou might have
for thust.

<b>WAITRESS
</b>(uninspired)
I'll be right back my lord.

The Cable Guy puts something together.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>There you go.

He hands Steven a paper crown. They both put theirs on.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Thanks for the help.

The Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Steven, don't turn around, but there is a
woman eyeing you like you are a piece of
meat and she hasn't eaten in a week.

Steven acts like he isn't interested, but he is.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Really? What does she look like?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Shoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking
me out. Man -- she is on fire! Total
robo-babe.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Are you serious?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Don't look.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I've got to look.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like
you are looking for the waitress.

Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She 
is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the 
cable Guy, annoyed.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind.
But you fell for it man. You are one
horny Indian Chief.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(not laughing)
You got me.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>So what did you want to rap about?

The trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hold that thought. Show's on.

The Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena.

<b>32	ON THE STAGE - A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ALAN RICKMAN IN "ROBIN 
</b><b>HOOD" SPEAKS TO THE CROWD
</b>
<b>HOST
</b>Welcome to a magnificent journey into the
past. This is Medieval Times!

The entire crowd, filled completely with white trash tourists, applauds.

<b>HOST
</b>Are you prepapred for a night of feasting
and sport the likes of which ye will
never forget?!

The audience applauds.

<b>HOST
</b>I charge you to stand up on your feet and
cheer for your section's knight!

ON THE STANDS - Each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight. 
The Cable Guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match. Steven remains seated.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Let the games begin! The Red Knight
rules! Blue Knight! You're going down!
Going down!

An embarrassed Steven applauds politely. The Cable Guy sits down.

<b>33	INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER
</b>
ON THE FLOOR - In the center of the room two Knights are fighting with swords while on 
horseback.

ON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands 
while watching the show.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(to the Watiress)
Could I get a knife and fork?

<b>WAITRESS
</b>There were no utensils in Medieval Times,
so there are no utensils at 'Medieval
Times.' Do you want a refill on that
Pepsi?

<b>STEVEN
</b>There were no utensils, but there was
Pepsi?

<b>WAITRESS
</b>Look, I have a lot of tables to get to.

The waitress exits.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(stands up - yells to the competitors)
Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no
mercy!

The two knights fight with swords. After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins.

The crowd erupts. The Cable Guy goes crazy.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(to Steven)
Come on, get into it, we won!

Releuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(halfheartedly)
Way to go Red Knight. Good job of
killing. Good work.

Steven and the Cable Guy sit down.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>So, what were you saying before?

<b>STEVEN
</b>(tentatively)
How do I put this? I've really enjoyed
hanging out with you, but...

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>That's why I became a cable guy. To make
friends like you. Every time I walk up to
a new door, that door is a possibility
for friendship. When I walked in your
apartment I knew there was something
there. I just knew it.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(sotto)
Oh lord.
(tries to get back on track)
I want you to know --

The lights change. Trumpets play a fanfare. The host walks out onto the stage, interrupting 
Steven.

<b>HOST
</b>We have reached the climax of our
competition good people! Now, two noble
men from our audience will battle to the
death to resolve a grievance. Will a
Master...
(looks at his clipboard)
Steven M. Bartowsky and Lord Ernie
Douglas make you way to the fighting
pit!

A spotlight shines on them. Steven is shocked.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What's going on?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>We're going to do battle. It'll be fun.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Is this a normal part of the show?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>No, but I give all the Knights free
cable. They said it would be cool if we
just went at it for a little while.

Two PIMPLY FACED SERFS from the show come and lead them away.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Is this safe?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>That's what the armor's for.

<b>34	INT. FIGHTING PIT - LATER
</b>
Steven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs. The Cable Guy could not 
be happier. Steven is freaked out.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What are we supposed to do? We've got to
be careful we don't hurt each other.

The Cable Guy doesn't answer him. He has his game face on.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I cannot listen to any of your
instructions for you are my sworn enemy,
and are about to meet your demise.

Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare.

<b>HOST
</b>Let the battle begin. Come now people,
let me hear your voices!

The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to 
the center of the pit.

The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven 
mirrors him, not sure of what to do.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Just take it easy.

The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. 
The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and 
pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his 
shield.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(enraged)
What are you doing?!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(matter of fact)
I'm trying to kill you.

The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled 
wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey, watch it!

The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the 
ground.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>This is just like when Spock had to fight
Kirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced
to do battle.

Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his 
sword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good
show.

Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the 
Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on 
the ground.

By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All
right. If you want to play rought, Daddy
can play rough.

The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, 
sending him to the ground.

The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy 
silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar 
weapon, and then begin to circle each other.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop
it!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>The name is Spock. If we don't battle to
the death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye
Jim.

He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek 
Battle Music" as they fight.

<b>STEVEN
</b>This isn't 'Star Trek!'

<b>MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC
</b>
They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes 
Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The 
Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing 
and roll in a vicious battle.

Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part 
of Steven's protection.
<b>STEVEN
</b>(looking down)
Jesus.

The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of 
pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting 
stick.

The show's host runs up to Steven.

<b>HOST
</b>Quickly, muster a top your steed.
(Steven doesn't move - the host drops character)
Get on the god damn horse! I don't think
he's kidding!

Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse 
sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Don't do this!
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Jim, we have no choice!
<b>STEVEN
</b>Oh my god.

They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one 
another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick.
The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, 
throws off his helmet.
<b>STEVEN
</b>(concerned)
Are you okay?

The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Well done good sir. You are the victor,
but we shall meet again.

The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the 
arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms 
in triumph, and smiles.
<b>DISSOLVE TO LATER:
</b><b>35	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>They are walking up the stairs.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You've got a real warrior's instinct.
<b>STEVEN
</b>I've got to admit there's a real feeling
of power holding that jousting stick.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>If Robin saw you tonight, she would be
begging you to take her back. I'm
telling you these knights get laid all
the time.
<b>STEVEN
</b>We should go again next week.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Easy there Lancelot.

Steven opens the door to his apartment.
<b>36	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>Steven pops into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine.
<b>MACHINE
</b>You have zero messages.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Nobody loves ya.
(grabs a beer from the fridge)
Hey, I think I left my staple gun in the
living room the other day. Could you be
a pal?

Steven walks to the living room.
<b>36AA	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>Steven turns on the lights.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>What do you think?

Steven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc 
player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line.
<b>STEVEN
</b>What is this?
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I took the liberty of updating your in
home entertainment system. I got you the
big screen, plus THX quality sound that
would make George Lucas cream in his
pants.
<b>STEVEN
</b>You went in my house when I wasn't home?
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>How else was I supposed to get the stuff
in here? Magic?
<b>STEVEN
</b>How much did this cost?
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Practically nothing. I have a connection.
Preferred customer. I hook him up, he
hooks me up.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't
feel right.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Yes but you give me something so much
more valuable… friendship.
<b>STEVEN
</b>And you've given me friendship, so we're
even.
(beat)
Really, don't take it personally, but
you've got to take it back.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(sadly)
Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck
works all week. Is it all right if I
leave it here till Saturday?
<b>STEVEN
</b>(guilty)
Sure, no problem. And don't get me
wrong. I really appreciate the gesture.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Mm-hmm.
(beat)
Staple gun?
<b>STEVEN
</b>Oh, right.

Steven picks up the staple gun. The Cable Guy pulls out a leather pouch. Steven drops the staple 
gun in the pouch. The Cable Guy never touches it.
<b>36A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY
</b>Steven dials the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads "HELLO STEVEN - HAVE A 
<b>WONDERFUL DAY."
</b><b>STEVEN
</b>(into the phone)
Robin, it's Steven again. I'm still
trying to reach you. Okay, I'm at work.
Call me.

He hangs up. He is getting frustrated. The door opens. Hal Daniels sticks his head in, but does not 
enter.
<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>How's it going?
<b>STEVEN
</b>Good.
<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>(long beat)
Good good?
<b>STEVEN
</b>Great.
<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>Good. Keep it up.

He leaves. The phone rings.
<b>SECRETARY
</b>(through the intercom)
Robin on line two.

Steven lights up. He takes a deep breath, then answers the phone.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey, I had the best time the other night.
When am I going to get you on my couch
again?

<b>36B	INT. VAN - DAY
</b>The Cable Guy is driving around. He speaks on a cellular phone.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Well tonight's not looking too good. How
about tomorrow?
<b>STEVEN
</b>Chip?
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I knew I'd get you on the phone that way.
Listen, that equipment will be history
the day after tomorrow. It sure would be
a pity to leave that karaoke machine a
virgin.
<b>STEVEN
</b>What do you mean?
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke
jam. No ifs ands or buts. Well maybe a
few butts. Later gator.

<b>37	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SATURDAY NIGHT
</b><b>CLOSE UP - AN OLD MAN'S FACE INTENSELY SINGING "AMERICAN WOMAN."
</b>We pull out to reveal we are in Steven's living room. It is populated with about twenty odd 
looking misfits mingling and dancing to the music. Among them we see Rick looking very 
uncomfortable.
<b>37AA	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>Steven is on the phone. He is dressed up. Occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink from the 
fridge.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey Robin. What's up? Did you get my
message?

<b>37A	INT. - ROBIN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT
</b>The scene intercuts between the two locations. Robin is dressed up, and on her way out.
<b>ROBIN
</b>Yes. You left me five messages. It king
of freaked me out.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Sorry. I've been trying to reach you
'cause I'm having a party.
You've got to come over.
<b>ROBIN
</b>(listens for a beat)
I can't. I'm going to dinner with
someone.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Dinner? What, like a date?
<b>ROBIN
</b>Not really a date.
<b>STEVEN
</b>You've got a date?! I thought things
were going well between us.
<b>ROBIN
</b>They are.
<b>STEVEN
</b>So why are you going out on a date?
<b>ROBIN
</b>I made it before we got together the
other night. I knew you would freak out.
<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm not freaking out.
<b>ROBIN
</b>Yes, you are freaking out.
<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm not. I just can't believe you would
do this.
<b>ROBIN
</b>I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm allowed
to date. It's not like we're back
together. We had a good time the other
night, and you're already pressuring me.
<b>STEVEN
</b>(pissy)
Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun.
<b>ROBIN
</b>I will.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Fine. Bye.

Steven hangs up the phone. The Cable Guy appears, and hands him a beer.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>This is just a sign that you need to live
a little. She's having fun, and you
should too.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
<b>STEVEN
</b>You're probably right.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Damn right I'm right.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Oh, I got you a little something.

He hands a box to the Cable Guy.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I thought you said we were even. You're
breaking the rules.
<b>STEVEN
</b>So shoot me.

He opens it. The box says, "Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days." The Cable Guy is so moved he 
cannot speak.
<b>STEVEN
</b>My brother said it might help with your
lisp.

The Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Words cannot express…
(he is too moved to finish his sentence)
<b>STEVEN
</b>It's no big deal.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Yes it is.

He stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Now I'm on a mission. This has got to be
the best party ever! Let's rock.

<b>37B	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>They walk into the living room. A sad looking OLDER MAN is singing "Superfreak." Everyone's 
having fun. We see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform mingling with the crowd.
(Revision Ends - Blue)
<b>STEVEN
</b>You've got plenty of friends.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>These people are acquaintances. They're
not ride to the airport friends, like us.
(sees something)
Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock. A
real barn burner. Don't look.
<b>STEVEN
</b>You're playing with me again.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>No sirree Steven. This woman is all over
you like a lamp-shade.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Shut up.

He turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits. 
When he looks at her, she smiles. He quickly turns back.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Did it just get hotter in here?
(grabs his crotch)
Oh, that hurts.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Who'd she come with?
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I don't know, but she looks pretty
available to me. I'd strike while the
iron is hot. He who hesitates,
masturbates, know what I'm saying?

<b>ANGLE ON
</b>A nerdy, balding man walks over to Rick.
<b>ODD MAN
</b>He sure can throw a party. Chip's an
incredible man. I really admire him.
<b>RICK
</b>Where do you know him from?
<b>ODD MAN
</b>He hooked up my cable. Didn't charge me
either. That's the kind of guy he is.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
<b>ANGLE ON
</b>Steven slowly walks over to the pretty woman.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey. I'm Steven.
<b>WOMAN
</b>Heather.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Can I get you something to drink?
<b>HEATHER
</b>Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila if you
will.
<b>STEVEN
</b>Coming right up.

<b>37C	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>AT THE KARAOKE AREA - Steven and Heather are singing "You're the One that I Want" from 
"Grease." They are both drunk, and having a great time.
The Cable Guy walks over to Rick.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm glad you accepted my invitation.
<b>RICK
</b>Steven invited me.

The Cable Guy looks at Steven and Heather.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Look at him. Have you ever seen him so
alive? He's changing, Rick. You've got
to learn to live with that.
<b>RICK
</b>I don't know what your story is "Chip
Douglas," but I'm going to find out.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Oooh. How dramatic.

The song ends. Rick walks away. He waves to Steven as he heads out. Steven runs over to him.
<b>RICK
</b>I'm getting out of here.
<b>STEVEN
</b>(drunk)
Why? This is a great party. This girl
is really into me.
<b>RICK
</b>You're whacked man. That guy is bad
news.
<b>STEVEN
</b>You don't even know him. You're just mad
'cause he kicked your ass in basketball.
<b>RICK
</b>I can't even deal. I'm outta here.

ON THE CABLE GUY - At the karaoke area. He speaks into the microphone.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hello everyone. First of all I'd like to
thank Steven for being such a terific
host.

Steven smiles, and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Don't forget to kick in some spinach for
the beer. Steven ain't made of money.
And I expect some of you to join in the
clean up crew.

<b>OFF DUTY COP
</b>Sing something! Do a song!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(false coyness)
No… I really couldn't.

<b>ODD MAN
</b>Come on! Do your song!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Okay, just to stop that guy from begging.
This number is dedicated to all of the
ladies in the house.

He puts on a Janet Jackson type microphone, then breaks into a fast paced rap of the song "Bust A 
Move," accompanied by elaborate dance moves.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(rapping)
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

During the musical break the Cable Guy begins to break dance. He knows all the moves. The 
robot, the spider, the crab. He looks like a deranged cast member or "Electric Boogaloo." The 
guests go crazy.

<b>ANGLE ON STEVEN AND HEATHER
</b>
<b>STEVEN
</b>You sounded just like Olivia Newton John.

<b>HEATHER
</b>I've been practicing for years.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(laughs)
So what do you do?

<b>HEATHER
</b>I can barely hear you. Do you want to
talk in the other room?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Oh… okay.

They walk into Steven's bedroom.

<b>ON THE CABLE GUY

<b>38	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven and Heather are sitting on the bed talking.

<b>STEVEN
</b>She says she wants a break, and that's
fine with me. I think I needed some time
also.

<b>HEATHER
</b>Yeah. I know what you mean.

She leans in and kisses him.

The cable Guy has got all of the guests in a frenzy.

<b>40	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven and Heather are kissing passionately. Suddenly the door flies open, and the Cable Guy 
dances into the room, takes out a Polaroid instamatic camera and FLASHES A PICTURE of 
them. Steven is disoriented. Behind the Cable Guy in the hallway is everyone from the party.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

He continues to rap, dance and flash pictures of everyone as he dances out of the room.

<b>41	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING
</b>
Steven walks into the living room looking a little disheveled. The Cable Guy is cooking him 
breakfast.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Good morning sleepy head. I hope you
don't mind, I crashed on the couch.
Bacon and eggs coming up.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Where did Heather go?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I heard her slip out early this morning.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What a night. That was just what I
needed.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You look like a new man.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I feel like a new man. I was getting so
used to being rejected. I really liked
her.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, it was my treat.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(taken aback)
What do you mean it was "your treat?"

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You know, I bought this time, you buy
next time.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(getting concerned)
Buy what?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You know, the women.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You mean Heather is a prostitute?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Of course she is. Do you think a woman
like that would hang out with us if we
weren't paying? Don't tell me you didn't
know.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I can't believe this.

He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>She's clean I assure you. I tried her out
last week to make sure she was top
quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not
a drip. She's the best, ask any of my
friends.

Steven cringes.

<b>STEVE
</b>You've got to be kidding? Please tell me
she's a friend of yours. You're just
playing with my mind again, right?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I wish I had friends like that.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Get out of my house!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she
was a working girl, but she kind of liked
you. You might have been able to
get a freebie.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Out, now! I don't ever want to see you
again.
(to himself)
Robin is never going to forgive me.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't
tell her. You want to get her back, I'll
help you get her back.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I don't want your help. I want you to
leave.
(gestures to the TV)
And take that stuff out of here.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(calmly)
Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see
ya'.

The Cable Guy exits.

<b>42	OMITTED
</b>
<b>43	EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
P.O.V. Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant.

We move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van. He watches them from across the street. A 
moment later he heads inside.

<b>44	INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
The Cable Guy enters the restaurant. The HOSTESS walks over to him.

<b>HOSTESS
</b>May I help you?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>No, I'm meeting someone here.

He looks around the restaurant, then spots Robin and a handsome, chiseled man at a table. They 
are on a date. The Cable Guy looks angry. He walks to the restroom.

<b>45	INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT
</b>
An OLDER BATHROOM ATTENDANT stands in front of the sinks. On the counter sits a 
variety of toiletries. A MAN washes his hands. The bathroom attendant hands him some paper 
towels. The man puts a tip in the basket, and exits.

<b>BATHROOM ATTENDANT
</b>Most appreciated.

The Cable Guy walks over to the bathroom attendant. He dramatically whips out a twenty dollar 
bill, and puts it in front of the bathroom attendant's nose.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You've been working hard. Take a break.

<b>46	INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER
</b>
Robin is talking to her date RAY. He is handsome, and somewhat goofy. They have empty salad 
plates in front of them.

<b>RAY
</b>My brother and I wanna start our own sun
block company. But the twist is, it's
only for skiing. SkiBlock. Or SunSki.
We haven't decided yet. Maybe BlockSki.
Do you think that sounds good?

<b>ROBIN
</b>BlockSki? That sounds right.

<b>RAY
</b>So, Gail told me you're just coming off a
relationship.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Well, not really. We're kind of in a
holding pattern. He wants more of a
commitment, but I don't think I'm ready.
I just want to have a good time for a
while.

<b>RAY
</b>Then we got to get you on a Skidoo!

<b>ROBIN
</b>Skidoo?

<b>RAY
</b>High powered snow mobile. It'll blow
your mind. It flies over powder like
it's glass.

Their waitress passes by.

<b>RAY
</b>(impatiently)
Hey, how are you doing on that chicken?
Have the eggs hatched yet? Thanks.

Robin is mortified by his behavior.

<b>RAY
</b>So, how's your work going?

<b>ROBIN
</b>It's been crazy. They just hired a –

<b>RAY
</b>Hold that thought. I have to use the rest
room. Be right back.

He leaves. Robin looks relieved to have a break.

<b>47	INT. RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Ray enters the restroom. The Cable Guy is now wearing the bathroom attendant's blue shirt white 
pants and a thin fake moustache. A DISTINGUISHED MAN walks over and washes his hands.

<b>MAN
</b>(to Cable guy)
Towel please.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>My pleasure.

The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he 
grabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them 
furiously. When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're 
dry. The man is aghast.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Enjoy your meal

The man exits. Ray walks toward the stalls.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Good evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't
it?

<b>RAY
</b>(curt)
Yeah.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>But I guess the weather's always pleasant
in here. The winters are remarkably mild.

He laughs at his own joke. Ray walks into the handicapped stall.

<b>CABLE GUY (OS)
</b>If you need anything, just let me know.
Anything at all.

<b>RAY
</b>(getting annoyed)
I think I can handle it.

Ray unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy 
is standing right behind him. He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm here to serve you.

<b>RAY
</b>Jesus! Get out of here!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Most people never bother to take
advantage of all my services, for
instance –

The Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face 
into the toilet bowl, sloshing it around. Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is
so very important.

He pulls his face out.
<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Then once you're done I have a variety of
skin care products which can make you
look years younger.

The Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter. He grabs a bottle of lotion.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>This lotion is superb at removing liver
spots.

He slaps it onto Ray's face.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>This one is an excellent moisturizer.

The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's 
about to put it on Ray's face.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>And one can never underestimate the
effects of a good cologne.

The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(sniffs)
Mm… High Karate. And now a touch of
powder.

He takes a large powder puff, and smashes it into Ray's face temporarily blinding him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(grabs a tweezer)
Ooh, I almost forget, it's oh so very
important to be properly tweezed.

The Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Ray's eyebrows.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You're on a big date, you'll need fresh
breath.

He takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Whoops, that's not mouth wash. But that
reminds me. Proper hair care is a must.

The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Looking good, now let's dry you off.

He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable 
Guy puts his face right up next to the air.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Now suck it. Suck the air!

Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut 
experiencing heavy G-Force.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>from this angle you look just like Neil
Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I
believe you have the "right stuff."

The Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Don't worry about the tip. But I've got
one for you.
(whispers into his ear)
Stay away from Robin. She's taken.

He tosses him out the door.

<b>47A	INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

The door opens, and Ray falls to the floor.

We see the image of a shaken up RAY being led out of the restaurant by two police officers.

<b>ANCHOR MAN
</b>A police sketch artist put together this
drawing from witnesses' descriptions.

We see a drawing which looks a little like the Cable Guy. In it he has a moustache and appears to 
be Hispanic. Steven looks carefully. Does he know that man? Nah. He changes the channel.

</b>Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin Harris?

<b>FEMALE NEIGHBOR
</b>(points)
It's right upstairs.

<b>50	INT. ROBIN'S HOME - NEXT DAY
</b>
There is a LOUD KNOCK. Robin walks to the door and opens it without undoing the chain.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Who is it?

The Cable Guy sticks his face as far into the crack of the door as possible.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>It's the Cable Guy.

<b>ROBIN
</b>There's no problem with my cable.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I've got an upgrade order for one Robin
Harris. The Rainbow package, that's every
pay channel available.

<b>ROBIN
</b>I didn't order this.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Apparently you've got a secret admirer.

She unlocks the chain, and the Cable Guy quickly steps inside.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Was it a man named Steven?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I can't tell you.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Come on.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>No, I promised Steven I wouldn't say.

He gave it away on purpose. They both laugh.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Whoops, I slipped. Well you didn't hear
it from me.

<b>51	INT. AIR DUCT - LATER

The Cable Guy is in the air duct. He is pulling cord. He reaches an area of the duct which opens 
up to a vent. He looks through and sees Robin changing in the bedroom. He tries not to look at 
Robin undress. He turns away.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm sorry Steven. I'm just a man.

He turns back and looks at her. He notices a birthmark on her back.

<b>52	INT. APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
The Cable Guy is on his way out.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>That about does it. Enjoy.

<b>ROBIN
</b>So, are you a friend of Steven's?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm proud to say I am. I installed his
cable recently, and we just hit it off.

<b>ROBIN
</b>That's right. You fixed his cable the
other night.
(suspicious)
So you guys are going out a lot?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Not really. That man is devoted to you.
You know I'm probably crossing a boundary
telling you this, but he's really crazy
about you.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Did he say that?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Only every five minutes. Quite frankly,
I'm sick of hearing it. No, I'm just
kidding with you.
(looks her deeply in the eyes)
He's a good man. He mentioned that you
guys have had some problems.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Well, it's a little complicated.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>It always is. You know I asked a woman to
marry me once. She said she wanted to
think about it. We agreed to take some
time apart to re-assess our feelings. To
give each other…
(mockingly)
space.
(chokes up)
Well, she is no longer with us.

<b>ROBIN
</b>I'm so sorry.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Sometimes you don't have the time you
think you have. Just promise me you'll
never go bungee jumping in Mexico.

<b>ROBIN

Oh… well…

<b>ROBIN
</b>You didn't have to do that.

</b>Giving me free cable. Only you would do
that.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You got it? Great.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Yes, your friend came by.

<b>STEVEN
</b>My friend?

<b>ROBIN
</b>The Cable Guy. I liked him. He was kind
of goofy, but nice. Thank you so much
for doing that.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm… glad you liked it. I've wanted to
do something nice for you, but I've been
trying to give you your space.

</b>Well, I don't think we should make rules
anymore.

<b>STEVE
</b>Okay.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

<b>STEVEN
</b>Sure. I'll call you as son as I get

Steven is elated. He can barely contain himself.

<b>RICK (O.S.)

Steven turns and sees Rick wearing a "Soundgarden" T-shirt.

<b>STEVEN

The concert. Oh Jesus.

<b>RICK
</b>What?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Robin just called. I think we're getting
back together.

<b>RICK
</b>(pissed)
So you're blowing me off? I can't
believe this.

<b>STEVEN
</b>This is the first time she asked to get
back together.

<b>RICK
</b>You do this every time. You only call me
after a girl breaks your heart. "Oh Rick
can I stay on your couch? Let's talk all
night about how mean girls are." Then as

it's bye-bye Rick. I don't know why I
fall for it anymore.

Steven gets out of the car. Rick drives off. Steven walks up the steps to his apartment. The Cable 
Guy appears from behind a corner.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Pretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you
knock 'em down.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced
her up.

<b>STEVEN
</b>How do you know we're back together?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I don't want you messing around with my
life. You've caused enough trouble as it
is.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I know. I felt bad about the other night,
so I wanted to make it up to you. So
what are you doing? Do you want to catch
a bite?

Steve looks the Cable Guy in the eye.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(sincerely yet curt)
Look, I appreciate you helping me out
with Robin. But you have to understand,
I'm going to have to work extra hard to
not screw this relationship up again.
You're a great guy, but I just don't have
any room in my life for a new friend. Do
you understand?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I appreciate your honesty. You're a real
straight shooter.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

<b>STEVEN
</b>So, you're okay?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal.
Whatever.

<b>STEVEN
</b>All right… well, take care.

Steven and Robin are kissing. Outside it is raining. There is occasional lightning and thunder. In 
the middle of kissing, lightning flashes. Steven looks up and sees a flash of the Cable Guy staring 
down at them, his faced pressed against the skylight. In the next flash he is gone. Was it real? 
Steven looks scared.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Are you alright?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm fine.

They go back to kissing.

<b>57A	EXT. TELEPHONE POLE/INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
The Cable Guy and Robin are speaking on the phone. As the conversation continues we slowly 
pull back and reveal that the Cable Guy is standing on the top of a telephone pole, dressed as a 
phone company employee. He speaks into a repairman's phone which is illegally hooked into the 
telephone pole.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, it's Chip Douglas.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Chip Douglas?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Your cable guy.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

<b>ROBIN
</b>(surprised to hear from him)
Oh, hi. What's up?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I feel kind of weird calling you. It's
just… I'm worried about Steven.

<b>ROBIN
</b>What is it?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Something isn't right. He hasn't been
himself lately. Have you noticed
anything?

<b>ROBIN
</b>No, things are actually going really
well.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Good.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Should I be worried?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Nope. I'm probably just being a nervous
nellie. Let's just keep our eyes open.

<b>ROBIN
</b>(nervous)
I will. Good-bye.

She hangs up, then dials Steven's number.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Steven Bartowsky please.

<b>57B	INT. STEVEN'S SECRETARY'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
His secretary, JOAN, answers the phone.

<b>JOAN
</b>Sorry Robin. He's in a meeting.

<b>58	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
A dozen of the top employees of the company Steven works for are having a meeting. Steven 
listens intently as a SALES MANAGER speaks to the group.

<b>SALES MANAGER
</b>The response to our initial offering has
been remarkable. A local investment
group has decided to buy the entire
complex and turn them into rentals. In
retrospect I must admit we made one big
mistake.

Everyone hangs on his every word.

<b>SALES MANAGER
</b>We should have asked for more money.

The entire room laughs. Mr. Daniels stands up.

<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>I just want to put this out there,
Stevey. You did it bro. You laid your
cajones, and mine, out on the table, and
you slam dunked it. Way to go.
(nervously jokes)
Now watch, they'll kick you upstairs
ahead of me. All right, in other
business…

As Mr. Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door.

<b>JOAN
</b>(quietly)
Pssst. Steven.

Steven turns and sees her. She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off.

<b>JOAN
</b>(more urgently-quietly)
I really need to speak with you.

Some people are beginning to notice this exchange.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(curtly)
It can wait.

Right then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking 
concerned.

<b>POLICE OFFICER
</b>Is there a Steven Bartowsky here?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Uh… I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going
on?

<b>POLICE OFFICER
</b>You are under arrest.

<b>MR. DANIELS
</b>On what charge?

<b>POLICE OFFICER
</b>Receipt of stolen merchandise.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What? I never –

<b>POLICE OFFICER
</b>Please put our hands on the table.

Steven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer. The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his 
club. Steven groans, then leans over in pain.

<b>POLICE OFFICER
</b>Please follow my instructions. Hands
on the table.

Steven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of 
everyone. It is pure humiliation.

<b>POLICE OFFICER
</b>Hands behind your back.

The other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around.

<b>POLICE OFFICER #2
</b>You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used against you
in a court of law. You have the right to
an attorney. If you cannot afford an
attorney one will be provided for you.
Do you understand?

<b>STEVE
</b>This is all a mistake. I didn't accept
any stolen goods.

Just then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head.

<b>CABLE GUY (V.O.)
</b>(with echo)
…you're getting THX quality sound that
would make George Lucas cream in his
pants – cream in his pants.

He pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He 
tries to break the tension with a joke.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to
jail.

Nobody laughs. He exits.

<b>59	EXT. OFFICE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Steven is walked to a police car, and put inside.

We slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. 
Apparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly 
watching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable 
guy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose.

<b>60	INT. POLICE STATION - LATER
</b>
Steven is chained to a bench. He is speaking to his father EARL, a stout man of sixty, and his 
<b>LAWYER.
</b>
<b>EARL
</b>I can't believe you did this.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I didn't do anything. My cable guy gave
me all that stuff as a present.

<b>EARL
</b>A stereo system and a big screen TV as a
present? You expect me to believe that?
You know you're killing your mother with
this.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I swear it's true.

<b>EARL
</b>Why would you accept such extravagant
gifts?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

<b>STEVEN
</b>I don't know. I shouldn't have.

<b>EARL
</b>What is really going on here Steven? Are
you on something?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm fine! I didn't do anything! Please
call my cable guy, his name is Ernie
Douglas.

<b>LAWYER
</b>Steven, the police looked into it, nobody
named Ernie Douglas works for 'The Cable
Company.'

<b>EARL
</b>You want to tell us the truth now

<b>STEVEN
</b>(falling apart)
That's got to be a mistake. Oh, this
is not happening.

<b>EARL
</b>Yes it is, and it's killing your mother.
Did you deliberately want to ruin our
fortieth anniversary party on Monday,
Steven?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Yeah, Dad, I did. It's all a big plan.
(to the lawyer)
When can you get me out of here?

<b>LAWYER
</b>Unfortunately it's too late to get a bail
hearing today. You're going to have to
spend the weekend in county lock up.

<b>STEVEN
</b>The entire weekend?

<b>62	INT. PRISON - LATER
</b>
Steven is now wearing prison blues. He holds a pillow and a set of sheets as he walks down the 
long corridor to his cell. Lining each side are cells filled with angry prisoners who throw things at 
Steven, and taunt him as he walks by. It is a nightmare.

<b>PRISONER #1
</b>New meat! Look at the pretty boy!

<b>PRISONER #2
</b>Nobody touches him, he's mine! You touch
him, you're dead!

<b>PRISONER #3
</b>Is baby scared? Don't cry baby!

They all laugh and scream at him until he reaches his cell. A guard opens the door. Steven enters 
his cell. He turns and inside is an angry looking prisoner. The door is locked behind him.

<b>ANGRY PRISONER
</b>Ooh, looks like I won the lottery.

<b>63	OMITTED
</b>
<b>64	INT. VISITORS ROOM - MORNING
</b>
A guard walks Steven in. His lawyer sits on the other side of the glass with his back to Steven. 
Steven sits down and picks up the phone, excited to hear any news.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What did you hear? What did you hear?

The man turns around. It is not Steven's lawyer, it is the
Cable Guy dressed in an expensive suit.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hello Steven. I came as soon as I heard.

Steven's head sinks.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Who are you?! What's your real name?!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>So many questions.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Why are you doing this to me?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I didn't do this to you, you did this to
you. You need to learn who your friends
are.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You set me up.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I taught you a lesson. I can be your best
friend, or your worst enemy. I hope
you'll choose the latter… I mean, the
former. You know what I mean.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'll never be your friend. You need help.

The Cable Guy absorbs the blow, then goes on the offensive.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Right now I think you're the one who
needs help. I'm here to give you comfort.

The Cable Guy huts his hand up to the glass.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Come on, touch it.

Steven just stares at him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Come on. You need human contact. Touch
it.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I will not touch it.

The Cable Guy stands up, and begins unbuttoning his shirt.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What are you doing? Stop it.

Steven looks around frantically.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I know how you're feeling right now.

The Cable Guy pushes his naked breast against the glass. Other prisoners are beginning to stare.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(smacking the glass)
Stop it! Stop it!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm here for you.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(smacks the glass three times)
Get off there! Are you trying to get me
killed?

The Cable Guy begins to laugh.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(as he buttons his shirt)
I was just messing with your mind. That
was from 'Midnight Express.' Awesome
film. Oliver Stone won the Academy Award
for the screenplay.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Guard! Guard!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Don't you worry about Robin, I'll make
sure she's well taken care of.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You go near her, I'll kill you.

Steven lunges at the glass. Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey, this is the guy who framed me!

The Cable Guy walks to his door. He turns to the guard at the door.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(warmly)
Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on
Pay Per View? I told you it's more fun
when it's Free Per View.

They both laugh. The door closes behind them.

<b>65	EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DAY
</b>
The Cable Guy is sitting at a table wearing a Walkman. People look at him funny as he speaks out 
loud to his lisp tape.

(Revision 11/13/95 - Blue)

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(over-pronouncing)
Sea shells. Sea shells. Salmon. Salmon.
Silverware. Silverware. Suspicious.
Suspicious. Sensational. Sensational.

Robin is brought over to the table by a hostess. The Cable Guy takes off his Walkman, and stands 
up to be polite. He sits down in perfect synch with her.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Hello.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hello. I'm sorry we have to meet under
these circumstances.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Me too. Believe me.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I know we don't know each other very
well, but we do have one thing in common, 
our concern for Steven.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Well, you were right. Something's
happening with him and he won't even
acknowledge it.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>If he refuses to admit he has a problem,
we may have to let him hit bottom. He's
gonna need some tough love.

<b>ROBIN
</b>(tentatively)
You know his lawyer said that nobody
named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable
Company.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(chuckles)
Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work
under a pseudonym so the customers won't
harass me at home. Kind of like a
stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry
Tate.

<b>ROBIN
</b>And he's saying he received all the
stereo equipment from you.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(I know, and I'm not mad. He's been
cornered, so he's telling some wives
tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me.

<b>ROBIN
</b>I just feel like I triggered this with
him. It's not that I don't want to get
married, it's just I felt like he wanted
to get married just to get married. I
don't deal well with pressure.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hey, welcome to the human race. We're
not perfect. We all think we have to
look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as
witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a
break.

<b>ROBIN
</b>God I could go for turkey and mashed
potatoes now.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Comfort food. Bring it on.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Exactly.

She laughs.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You've got a great laugh. Can I make a
small request? I'd like to hear it a little
more often.

She blushes.

<b>66	INT. PRISON ADMINISTRATION - NEXT DAY
</b>
ON THE TV - Hard Copy's BARRY NOLAN, sits behind his desk giving a news update.

<b>BARRY NOLAN
</b>The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into
chaos as a result of a videotape made a
month after the killing. In this "Hard
Copy" exclusive an apparently intoxicated
Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his
friends at a party. The judge has not
decided whether this tape is admissible
as evidence.

We see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party. The date and time are seen in the corner. Sam stands 
next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror. Sam gestures with a beer 
bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror.

<b>SAM SWEET
</b>(to camera)
Hey everyone. Look it's me and…
(gestures to his reflection)
my brother Stan.
(waves at reflection)
Hi Stan. It's so nice to see you. How
are you feeling?
(to camera)
Look, he's alive.

Sam punches the mirror, shattering it.

<b>SAM SWEET
</b>(angry)
Now he's dead.

Realizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile.

<b>SAM SWEET
</b>What? I'm just goofing around.

We pull back and reveal a group of police officers watching this on television.

We pan over to Steven's father EARL paying bail.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm sorry dad.

<b>EARL
</b>I don't want to hear it. Do you know the
pain you out your mother through? You're
lucky she didn't die of a heart attack.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I didn't do anything.

<b>EARL
</b>Just like you said you didn't steal that
'X-Men' comic book when you were eight.
Then I found it in your underwear drawer.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Will you ever stop mentioning that?

<b>EARL
</b>This cost me a lot of money. You jump
bail, and I swear I'll hire a bounty
hunter to hunt you down.

<b>67	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Steven walks into his apartment, exhausted from his jail experience. He walks into the living room 
and sees several new frames on the wall. They are four foot blow ups of Polaroid photographs of 
Steven with his arm around the Cable Guy at the karaoke jam. The photos have been tinted in a 
stylish fashion.

Steven angrily runs to the wall and takes them down.

<b>68	OMITTED

<b>69	EXT. STEVEN'S PARENTS' HOME - NIGHT

Steven and Robin are walking up the stairs to the front door. They are dressed up for his parents' 
anniversary party.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

<b>ROBIN
</b>Are you sure you're okay?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm fine.

<b>ROBIN
</b>You're not fine. When you say you're
fine, I know you're not fine.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I just want to get this over with so I
can go home and get some rest.

<b>ROBIN
</b>I wanted you to know I invited your
friend. He was concerned about you.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Great. I feel. Bad. I've been kind of
blowing Rick off lately.

He rings the doorbell.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Not Rick.

The door opens. Standing there, dressed to kill, is the Cable Guy.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You can only come in if you came to rage.

Steven is shocked. Robin walks in. When Steven walks in, the Cable Guy stops him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(to Robin)
Is this guy cool?
(to Steven)
I'm just joshing. Come on in.

They walk inside.

<b>70	INT. STEVEN'S FATHER'S HOME
</b>
Steven turns to Robin.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(enraged)
What is he doing here?

<b>ROBIN
</b>I invited him.

<b>STEVEN
</b>When did you invite him?

<b>ROBIN
</b>At lunch the other day.

<b>STEVEN
</b>At lunch? You had lunch with him?

The Cable Guy walks over.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Hello. You look great.

She gives him a peck on the cheek. Steven winces.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>And you are a vision. Hello Steven.
You're looking rested.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Come here.

He pulls the Cable Guy aside.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Steven, what's with you tonight? I'm
getting some really weird energy from
you.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Maybe it's because I just got out of
prison, where you sent me. I should just
drag you to the police right now.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You can if you like, but I'd hate to have
to show Robin this.

He takes out a Polaroid of Steven kissing the hooker.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You son of a bitch.

The Cable Gut quickly puts it away.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Come on Steven, let's just have a good
time tonight.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

Robin, Earl and Steven's mother walk over.

<b>EARL
</b>Steven, your mother and I had a long talk
with your friend Larry here when he came
over to screw in the cable.

<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER
</b>(to the Cable Guy)
Thank you again for that.

<b>EARL
</b>(beat)
We owe you an apology. I didn't realize
the seriousness of your problems. You're
obviously going through some kind of
personal hell and I need to be more
understanding. We didn't get involved
with things like that when I was your
age.

Steven cannot figure out what kind of lie the Cable Guy has told them.

<b>EARL
</b>I know we haven't been there for you
lately but we're going to see you through
this, 'cause we are a family. I love
you.

He gives him a big hug. Steven grimaces.

<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER
</b>You've got a good friend here.

They walk into the next room where the entire family is gathered for pre-dinner cocktails.

Steven's brother PETE walks over to Steven. He carries a baby in a pouch.

<b>PETE
</b>(winks)
Hey buddy, we're with you. Keep your
chin up.

<b>71	INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
</b>
As the Cable Guy charms Steven's family we pan across all of the guests laughing, and enjoying 
dinner.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and
he's chasing me, swinging like a mad
man. I'm yelling at him,
'hey, it's just a show!'

(Revision Ends - Blue)

<b>STEVEN'S SISTER
</b>He always takes things too seriously.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Tell me something I don't know. This guy
almost took my head off.

Everybody laughs.

The camera moves to Steven. He stares at the Cable Guy, his eyes filled with rage.

<b>STEVEN'S P.O.V.
</b>
The Cable Guy is talking and eating in SLOW-MOTION.

ON STEVEN - watching him. He is in normal motion.

ON THE CABLE GUY - eating in SLOW-MOTION

ON STEVEN - getting very irritated.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What are you doing?

<b>ON THE CABLE GUY
</b>
As he talks we realize he has not been in slow motion, he's just been pretending he's in slow 
motion.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>It's from "Goodfellas." Remember the
intro scene at the bar. I'm Johnny Two
Times.

He moves in slow motion some more. Everyone laughs.

TONY, Steven's six year old nephew, runs to the Cable Guy with a toy gun.

<b>TONY/CABLE GUY
</b>Pow, pow, pow. You're under arrest.

Everyone laughs. The Cable Guy starts running around the table. Tony makes chase, laughing all 
the way.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You'll never catch me copper.

The Cable Guy stops, grabs a piece of asparagus and puts it between his lip and nose, and pretends 
it's a moustache.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm gonna wear a disguise.

Steven looks at the Cable Guy and remembers something.

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees the Cable Guy. The artist's rendering of the man who beat up Robin's 
date appears in front of the Cable Guy's face. Steven realizes that they are the same person.

Steven gets a frightened look on his face.

The kid points his gun at the Cable Guy and yells "pow." The Cable Guy drops to the floor like 
he's been shot.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Oh, you got me.

The Cable Guy plays dead. The kid walks over to him. When he gets close, the Cable Guy lunges 
to grab him.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(devil voice)
Aaah!!! Nobody messes with me and lives!

The kid screams with laughter and runs away. The Cable Guy chases him around the table and out 
of the room. Steven instantly fears for Tony's safety. He follows them.

<b>75A	INT. LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER
</b>
Steven walks around looking for Tony. Suddenly from behind a couch Tony and the Cable Guy 
pop out.

<b>TONY/CABLE GUY
</b>Booo!

Steven flies back, scared out of his wits. Tony and the Cable Guy start laughing hysterically. They 
have a grand 'ol time enjoying their little prank.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Oh man, you should have seen your face.
It was classic.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Very funny. Tony, go to your mother!

Tony immediately starts crying. He leaves.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Look what you've done.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I know you beat up Robin's date.

The Cable Guy's laughter stops on a dime.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I guess I did what you didn't have the
guts to do.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You stay away from Robin.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(disturbed)
Don't mess with me. I'm feeling like a
part of the family, and I like it. You
should try it sometime.

Steven's mother enters.

<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER
</b>(looks at them)
My, you two look like brothers. Come on
back, we're all having coffee in the
living room.

Cable Guy quickly starts walking back to the dining room.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(happily)
Are you guys trying to fatten me up?
'Cause if you are, you're doing a damn
good job of it.

He laughs, and exits. Steven slowly follows.

<b>76-78 OMITTED
</b>
<b>79	INT. LIVING AREA - LATER
</b>
Everyone is sitting around having coffee. The Cable Guy is writing words on torn up pieces of 
paper.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You guys have never played "Porno
Password?"

<b>EARL
</b>No, but I like the sound of it.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>It's the adult version of the popular
television game show. Robin you're on my
team. Steven, you're with mom.
(to everyone else)
You're the audience.

The Cable Guy sits next to Robin. Steven and his mother sit across from them.

The Cable Guy looks at the word, then shows it to the family so none of the contestants can see it. 
He whispers it in Steven's ear.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(whispers)
The password is… vagina.

Steven winces.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I really don't want to play this game.
(looks to his mother)
Woman. Woman.

<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER
</b>Uh… man?

<b>STEVEN
</b>No.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(to Robin)
Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Pe-nis.

Robin concentrates hard, but she can't figure it out.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Peeee-nis. Peeee-nis.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Vagina?

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(pumps his fist)
Yes!

He high fives Robin. Everyone laughs.

<b>EARL
</b>(blurts out)
I thought it was going to be schlong!
(covers his mouth - embarrassed)
Whoops.

Everyone laughs. They are all having a great time, except Steven. The Cable Guy looks at the next 
word, shows it to the family privately, then whipsers to Steven.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>The password is… nipple.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Can I pass?

<b>EARL
</b>Come on Steven, don't be a stick in the
mud.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Breast. Breast.

<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER
</b>Tit?

Everyone laughs. Steven's face is red.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Hard…
(gestures like there is another word after it)
Hard…

<b>ROBIN
</b>Erection?

Everyone laughs. Steven looks like he might kill the Cable Guy.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Center. Center.

<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER
</b>Nipple?

Everyone cheers.

<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER
</b>I can't believe I got it. I was going to
say areola.

Everyone laughs except Steven, who is mortified.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I wish you did, 'cause we'd be ahead.

The Cable Guy shows the word to everyone, then whispers in Steven's ear.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>The password is… I'm not sure how to
pronounce this, it's either clitoris, or
clit-oris.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(snaps)
I can't say that to my mother!

<b>EARL
</b>Hey, she's a grown woman. She can handle
it.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Come on Steven. We're just having fun.

<b>STEVEN
</b>No, I've had enough. I can't do this.
This guy is ruining my life, I won't sit
here and play X-rated party games with
him.

<b>EARL
</b>Steven, I really think you're over-
reacting.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I am not over-reacting. You're all being
fooled by this guy! He's a felon for
Christ sake!
(to the Cable Guy)
I hate you! Get out of my life!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm sorry everyone. If I am a nuisance,
I will leave. I would never stay where I
am not wanted.

<b>ROBIN
</b>(to the Cable Guy)
You're not a nuisance. Please don't go.
(to Steven)
Steven, you're being an asshole.

<b>EARL
</b>Yeah, Steven it seems like you're the one
with the problem.

<b>STEVEN
</b>What? You have no idea what this guy is
really like.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'll just go.

<b>STEVEN
</b>See what I mean!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Steven, what's with you tonight?
(gets close to Steven and whispers)
Robin showed me that birthmark on her
left shoulder. It's very sexy.

Steven punches the Cable Guy in the facem sending him to the floor. All of the women, including 
Robin run to help him.

<b>ROBIN
</b>(to Steven)
I can't believe you.

The Cable Guy gets up.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm fine. Thank you for a delightful
evening.
(to Steven)
I forgive you.

He exits. Everyone looks at Steven like he is the devil.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You don't understand.

Everyone walks away from Steven. The party is over.

<b>80	EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER
</b>
Robin is venting her anger at Steven as they walk to the car.

<b>ROBIN
</b>I just think you were completely out of
line. I don't know what's happening to
you these days.

Steven gets fed up.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Robin, this guy is a sociopath. He
leaves messages on my machine night and
day. He shows up wherever I go. He
won't leave me alone.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Sounds familiar.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You know he was the one who beat up your
date at that restaurant. That's right.
And he gave you the free cable. It wasn't
me.

<b>ROBIN
</b>But you took the credit for it?

<b>STEVEN
</b>That's what he wanted. He was
manipulating me. It feels so good to be
honest about this. We're finally
communicating. I've been wanting to tell
you for so long, but he's been
blackmailing me.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Blackmailing you? How?

<b>STEVEN
</b>With a photograph.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Of what?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Me with a... prostitute.

<b>ROBIN
</b>What?!

<b>STEVEN
</b>He set it up. He invited this woman to
my party and didn't tell me she was a
prostitute. I'm so glad we can talk
about this.

<b>ROBIN
</b>When did you have a party?

<b>STEVEN
</b>When we weren't communicating. I invited
you. You were out on a date.

<b>ROBIN
</b>And you were with a prostitute.

<b>STEVEN
</b>She seduced me. That's what they do.
They're professionals. And I didn't even
know she was a prostitute.

<b>ROBIN
</b>So that makes it better?

<b>STEVEN
</b>That's not the point. The point is this
guy has been setting me up. He's
responsible.

<b>ROBIN
</b>He didn't have sex with a whore. You
did.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Robin you don't --

<b>ROBIN
</b>I don't want to hear it. Breaking up was
the best thing we ever did. You have
some serious problems, and it's not my
responsibility to help you. I am only
responsible for my own happiness.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Where did that come from?

<b>ROBIN
</b>It was Jerry Springer's "final thought."

She exits.

Rick is running to an editing bay. Steven follows him.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I'm sorry I've been blowing you off.

<b>RICK
</b>You bet your ass you've been blowing me
off.

<b>STEVEN
</b>It's just, this guy is really doing a
number on me.

<b>RICK
</b>I told you not to hang out with him.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You're the one who told me to offer him
money so I could get free cable.

<b>RICK
</b>You didn't tell me he was a psychopath.
(beat)
I'll see if I can get my friend in
research to track him down. What's his
name again?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Ernie Douglas.

<b>RICK
</b>Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? Why does
that sound so familiar?

<b>81	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Steven's secretary Joan is watching a news report about the Sam Sweet trial on a mini television.

On the TV - a Female Prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman.

Joan changes channels. The image changes to LARRY KING interviewing ALAN 
DERSHOWITZ regarding "the abuse excuse."

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Steven walks over to Joan.

<b>STEVEN
</b>(to his secretary)
Did anyone notice I'm late?

<b>JOAN
</b>What are you talking about, you've been
here for an hour.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Thank you.

Steven walks to his office.

<b>81A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Steven walks behind his desk. He notices something which disturbs him. His computer is on. He 
clicks a button and a message comes on the screen.

<b>ON THE SCREEN - "GOOD MORNING STEVEN. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. HERE'S 
</b><b>AN EXTRA SPECIAL SURPRISE."
</b>
Then an image comes on the screen. It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the 
computer format. The video is of Robin and Steven talking. It is the conversation they had before 
they watched "Sleepless in Seattle."

<b>STEVEN
</b>Work's good.

<b>ROBIN
</b>How's Hal?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Don't get me started. That guy has no
vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.
He's just worthless.

<b>ROBIN
</b>It's just great that you're getting to do
it. It's a real step up.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I
could really get some stuff done.

The sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast. He looks up and sees the scene is playing 
on every computer in the office. He gets a panicked look on his face. Is Hal seeing this? He runs 
out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this.

<b>81B	OFFICE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down.

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office.

BACK TO STEVEN - He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can.

<b>81C	INT. HAL'S OFFICE
</b>
Steven walks in. Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer. He looks up and 
sees Steven.

<b>HAL
</b>Don't worry. I didn't see it --- 'cause I

Steven knows what's coming.

Steven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings. He has been fired. Suddenly a car 
alarm beeps. It's headlights flash. Then another, and another. Soon he is surrounded by screaming 
car alarms, and flashing headlights. He looks around in fear.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Chip! Chip, this isn't funny! Where are
you?!!!

Suddenly they all stop simultaneously, and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through 
the garage.

Steven runs to his car, and gets in. He drives up the ramp in a panic. From out of nowhere the 
Cable Guy steps into the beam of his headlights. He cannot stop in time. The Cable Guy is thrown 
into the air, then lands on the back of the roof of the car. Before he falls off he grabs on to the bar 
of the luggage rack.

Steven looks through his rear view window and sees the Cable Guy staring at him.

As Steven continues to drive the Cable Guy climbs on to the roof of the car, then jumps on the 
hood, and stares at Steven through the windshield. Steven swerves around, almost losing control 
of the car.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Leave me alone! I have no job, no
girlfriend, no family anymore! It's
over! You won!

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(menacingly)
Oh no. It's not over. It's just gettin'
started.

He turns a corner very sharply throwing the Cable Guy off his car. The Cable Guy falls to the 
ground, rolling many times, then leaps to his feet using the momentum of the roll, and runs off, 
scampering like a supernatural bug.

She begins tapping her foot nervously.

<b>RICK
</b>Could you stop that?

<b>RESEARCHER
</b>Don't snap at me. I'm doing this as a
favor.

He continues staring at her two-tone wing tipped style shoe.

<b>RICK
</b>(has an epiphany)
Wait, could you start that again? Start
tapping your foot again.

She begins tapping. Rick begins humming the theme to "My Three Sons." She joins him. They sing 
louder and louder. They've broken the code.

</b>I've got a list of every cable installer
fired in the last four years. Every one

Murray Slaughter, Brendan Walsh, Sam

Steven walks in and looks for the Cable Guy's hidden camera as he speaks on the phone.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Carmine from "Laverne and Shirley."

<b>RICK
</b>That's so sad that you know that.
Anyway, the cable company in town fired a
guy six months ago named Darren Stevens.
He stole the truck and disappeared.
That's our guy.

Steven finds a small camera in one of the television speakers. He rips it out.

<b>STEVEN
</b>So he doesn't even work for the Cable
Company?

<b>97A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Quick cuts of Steven bolting doors, and locking windows.

<b>RICK (VO)
</b>He was fired for beating up a customer
who yelled at him for being late. A

a lead on who he really is.
If I were you I'd lock down tonight.
I'll call you when I get some more info.

<b>98	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Steven is watching television. He struggles to stay awake.

ON THE TV - Court TV. The prosecutor in the Sam Sweet trial is speaking.

<b>PROSECUTOR (ON TV)
</b>Don't let your memories of these cute
twins distract you from the fact that
this funny star of a situation comedy
killed his own brother in cold blood,
then called the police and said he was
killed by an Asian gang. There was no
laugh-track on that night.

The prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep.

<b>99	ON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP	HE SLOWLY WAKES UP.
</b>
The gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar.

ON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We 
reveal that it is the Cable Guy.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>This man killed his own brother. Some
people don't even have a brother...

The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy's face. He looks to camera.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>...do they Steven? Are you listening to
me? Don't shut it off. Don't shut it --

ON STEVEN - He shuts off the TV, and walks out of the room.

<b>100	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The entire apartment appears much larger. Steven walks down the hallway. He looks into the 
living room and sees Rick.

<b>RICK
</b>Why do you keep icing me man?

<b>100A	INT. ELONGATED BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

He opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom. The shower is steaming. The 
two eight year old Sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky. He quickly closes the 
door.

<b>100B	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room, but when he opens it he 
sees Robin's bedroom.

<b>100C	INT. ROIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Robin is in bed. A man wearing a cable installer's uniform is smothering her with a pillow. The 
man turns -- it is Steven. He quickly closes the door.

He hears someone pounding on the front door. He opens the door. Nobody is there. Then the 
Cable Guy pops into frame holding a cut cord.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You owe me!

Steven slams the door. Then looks through the peep hole.

<b>101	P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE
</b>
The Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and 
more distorted as he come closer to the peephole. BANG! He hits the door. Then disappears from 
frame. A moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs 
again to the door even faster. BANG! He staggers back into position again. He runs toward the 
door.

<b>102	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Steven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him.

Steven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast 
but appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the 
Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks 
back another time and the Cable Guy is gone.

He keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through. 
He becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab 
him. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I just want to hang out. No big deal.

Steven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room.

Steven runs in. The television is on. He sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do.

He puts his head down. When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set. The 
Cable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Steven, you're just like me. We're cut
from the same cloth. We're one and the
same!

Then it opens its mouth, and swallows Steven pulling him into the television.

<b>105	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Steven wakes up in a cold sweat.

<b>STEVEN

Oh my god. She's right. I am a

The phone rings.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hello.

<b>CABLE GUY (VO)
</b>It didn't have to come to this Steven.
We could have been blood brothers.

dearest in the world.

<b>STEVEN (VO)
</b>I swear to God, if you touch --

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Could you hold on a second, I've got call
waiting. It'll just be a sec.

He clicks over. Steven just sits there, waiting. Waiting some more. Then the Cable Guy clicks 
back.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Sorry about that. Where was I? Oh yeah.
You're going to feel my wrath.

<b>107	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Oh Steven, I'm just so tired. So very
tired.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Let's talk in person. Where are you?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm close. So very close.

The camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down. Then the camera rises 
up and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven. A single 
beam of light shines across his face. As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his 
face. He never acknowledges it.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You know, I don't think you're right for
Robin. She needs someone who can be
sensitive to her needs. Someone who
understands her soul.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You stay away from her.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Aren't we the control freak. Looks like
you're starting to sweat.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I got the camera. You can't see me.

Steven begins to pick his face.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Oh yeah? Then why are you picking your
face?

Steven throws the phone. When it lands we see the speaker phone light is on. He begins looking 
for the camera. He smashes his TV.

JUMP CUTS - Steven tearing through everything in his apartment.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You're getting closer.

Steven overturns a CD rack.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Pity, such a nice CD rack. You know
sometimes the answer is right under your
nose.

Steven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax. 
He starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out.

He looks down into the hole, he sees nothing. Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face 
into the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad 
man. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears 
the Cable Guy scuttle away.

Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the 
aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, 
then through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small 
makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace.

There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing 
next to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the 
Cable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television 
monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a 
cellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says "Steven" next to it.

Steven gets up, and runs out of his front door.

<b>RICK
</b>Me too. I've got the whole story.

<b>STEVEN
</b>That's great. Let's meet at the old

<b>RICK
</b>Why all the way out there?

<b>STEVEN
</b>I think he's been following me. Don't be

<b>109AB	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Steven's car screeches to a stop. He runs up to Robin's door and starts knocking. Her FEMALE 
NEIGHBOOR opens her door.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Be home! Be home!

<b>FEMALE NEIGHBOOR
</b>Go away! I remember you. You're her
obsessive boyfriend. She said you might
come here. I'm calling the police.

She closers her door. He runs off.

<b>109A	EXT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - NIGHT

Rick drives up, then walks into the building.

<b>110	INT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Rick walks through the school looking for Steven.

<b>RICK
</b>Steven? Steven?

In the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear
what you found out about this nut.

<b>RICK
</b>I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply
troubled. Only child. His mother was
arrested for prostitution, and phone
solicitation. Apparently she was some
phone sex pioneer.

<b>STEVEN
</b>No way.

<b>RICK
</b>And get this, he was discharged from the
Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so
he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two
using a Radio Shack computer. And that's
not the half of it.

As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, 
but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of 
Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Really? Tell me more.

Rick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I'm very interested in learning
everything I can about that wacked out
cable installer.

He turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy.

The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not 
see Rick yelp, and fall.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>It sounds like he might hurt somebody.

<b>110A	INT. STEVEN'S CAR - NIGHT

<b>113	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Steven enters the room. The camera pulls back to reveal Rick laying in full traction, face down, his 
rear end heavily bandaged. He is unconscious.

Steven tentatively walks over to Rick's rear end. He pulls back a small portion of the bandage and 
sees that his butt is covered with staples. The staples form the shape of a television with an 
antenna. Inside the TV is the word "RING."

<b>STEVE
</b>(perplexed)
Ring?

The phone rings. Steven jumps, then picks up the phone.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hello.

<b>CABLE GUY (VO)
</b>Poor Rick. Seems he had a little
accident with the business end of a
staple gun.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

<b>STEVEN
</b>You're not going to get away with this.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>The question is, are you going to get
away with it? Apparently there was an

Steven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of

Steven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and 
begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds 
of horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight 
toward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he 
smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs.

The horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over 
Steven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(chuckles)
Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed
it all last month.

The Cable Guy rides toward him again.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(like the Vegas announcer)
Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!

(Revision Ends - Blue)

This time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle 
of mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Where's Robin?!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>This isn't about Robin, this is about you
and me.

Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Where's Robin?!!!

Steven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like 
warriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Tell me!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(nonchalantly)
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question?

Steven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams 
into the ground.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Steven you've changed.
(beat - then impressed)
I like it.

The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him.

They wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of 
his belt and turns it on.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I think it's time to make you cable ready.

He slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large 
branch and bats the Cable Guy off him.

The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion 
which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Last time we fought I let you win! Best
two out of three!

MUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(crazed)
You treat me like the TV! You use me, but
you can't live without me!

The Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You can't shut me off with your remote
control!!!! I'm not like Robin and Rick
and Mommy and Daddy and brother and
sister and cousin --

Steven smashes him in the head with the branch.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I got the point.

The Cable Guy goes down. He appears to be unconscious.

<b>ROBIN
</b>(in the distance)
Steven.

He looks to the dish, but cannot see her.

<b>123	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - MOMENTS LATER

Steven climbs over the edge into the dish. Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled 
with several feet of rain water.

Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the 
satellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the 
center of where those wires meet.

Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Help me Steven!

In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at 
the top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Steven! Look out!

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(mimics her)
Yeah Steven. Look out!

The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking 
Steven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the 
water.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(sweetly, like a girl)
I've missed you.

The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy 
dives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and 
speaks right into his face.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(dramatically)
"Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it."
Kevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't
know what the fuss was about, the movie
ruled, I saw it six times.

He pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in
this position?

He pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Who would have thunk it?

Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have 
knocked his jaw out of alignment.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(without any lisp)
You're gonna have to do better than that
Steven.
(realizing his lisp is gone)
Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone.

Steven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(lisping again)
You stupid son of a bitch.

The Cable Guy falls unconscious.

<b>ROBIN
</b>Steven!

Steven runs to her.

<b>124	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER
</b>
He runs to the side of the dish. He realizes he must climb up to release her. He climbs onto the 
WIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance 
several times.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Hang on.

CLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(laughs maniacally)
I know what your saying. Who does this
guy think he is, Jason?

<b>STEVEN
</b>Stay away from her!

Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony
Curtis. He was just on "Life-styles of
the Rich and Famous." He still looks
terrific.

Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's 
landing makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging 
there.

The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>And the race is on.

He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed.

Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and 
joins him.

The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(knows he's about to fall)
This is such an anti-climactic way to end
this.

The Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his 
demise.

<b>125	EXT. SATELLITTE DISH - LATER
</b>
Steven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are 
exhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close.

<b>ROBIN
</b>I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love
you.

<b>STEVEN
</b>I love you too. You're right. We
shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of
problems to work out which have
absolutely nothing to do with you.

<b>ROBIN
</b>We'll work them out together.

They kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts 
coughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(between coughs)
What just happened? Where am I?
(remembers)
Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you.

He leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays 
him on the ground.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(to Robin)
It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it
on Sly Stallone in "Rocky Three." He
should wake up in thirty seconds, so
let's get going.

He holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish.

Steven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the 
rdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them.

<b>126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT
</b>
The Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance.

The Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin 
with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the 
platform.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Easy.

He walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish 
below. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm
just trying to show you the kind of
things that can happen when you mistreat
people.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Don't do anything stupid.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>You know this is just like that secen in
that Clint Eastwood movie "Dirty Harry" --

<b>STEVEN
</b>(snaps)
No! This is not like anything! This is
not a movie! We're real people! You're
hurting us! This is reality!

The Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of 
Robin. She runs to Steven's arms.

From below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. 
The Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>If this is reality...
(he climbs onto the guard railing)
...I am outta here.

The Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Nooo!

Steven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other 
hand.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You're not going anywhere.

The Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto 
the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Don't do this. You just need help. We all
get lonely.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Yeah, but I get really lonely.
(beat)
I mean, look at me.

<b>STEVEN
</b>You're gonna be fine. Just come on up.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>(a long beat)
Steven, I think I sat too close to the
television. Mommy was right.

Steven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto 
his hand at the last possible second.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>It's too late for me, but there's a lot
of little Cable Boys out there who still
have a chance. Say good-bye to the baby-
sitter.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

The Cable Guy stops holding onto Steven's hand. He begins falling toward the dish below.

what he is doing.

The Cable Guy appears dead. The needle of the antenna sticks through his mid-section. A red light 
blinks at the tip of the needle. Then, the Cable Guy's eyes open.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Damn, that hurt like a mother. What the
hell was I thinking?
(looks at the needle)
Oh man, that stings.

Steven and Robin look relieved.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>A little help here!

A pasty white couch potato stares at the white noise, not sure what to do. He turns and picks up a 
book. As music crescendos he begins to read.

<b>135	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER
</b>
The Cable Guy is being taken away on a stretcher toward an emergency helicopter. Steven and 
Robin are covered in police blankets. Steven calls to a paramedic.

<b>STEVEN
</b>Is he going to be all right?

<b>PARAMEDIC
</b>I don't know. It's in God's hands.

The paramedics put the Cable Guy on the helicopter. The helicopter flies away.

P.O.V. SHOT - From the helicopter looking down on Steven and Robin holding each other, 
getting smaller and smaller until they disappear.

The Cable Guy lies in a stretcher next to the paramedic. He is barely conscious, struggling for

<b>PARAMEDIC
</b>Hang in there buddy. Stay with me. Just

The Cable Guy's eyes slowly open. He motions for the paramedic to come closer.

<b>CABLE GUY
</b>Am I really your buddy?

The helicopter flies away.
