</b>          Mist. Dark trees.     Dripping vines.        An ENGINE RUMBLES in the
          distance.
<b>          
</b>          The full moon shimmers on a puddle.          A FROG SPLATS IN,
          splashing a one man pup tent.

</b><b>          
</b>          LUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen
          asleep reading by flashlight. He's nineteen, still slightly
          awkward and unaware he's growing handsome.
<b>          
</b>          He listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer.
<b>          
</b>          He peers out through the tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR
          toward him. Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he HURLS
          himself against the side of the tent, as...
<b>          
</b><b>          OUTSIDE
</b><b>          
</b>          an RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop
          in the mud.
<b>          
</b>          Stillness.
<b>          
</b>          Luke extricates himself from the tent.          He runs to the driver-
          side window of the RV.

</b>                    It's just something I really wanted
                    to do.
<b>          
</b>          Luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink.

</b><b>          
</b>          Students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle.
<b>          
</b>          The huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old
          SEMI-TRUCK RUMBLES up to the curb. It's the cab only, like
          the sliced-off front of a train engine.
<b>          
</b>          Luke hops down, startling his friends, KEENAN and JANINE,
          passionately making out on the sidewalk.
<b>          
</b>          Twenty, brainy and athletic, Janine adjusts her glasses, the
          only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers
          Luke's massive truck.

</b><b>                              JANINE
</b>                    It's remarkable. Sort of retro. I

</b><b>                              LUKE
</b>                    I changed my mind.
<b>          
</b>          Hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to Keenan,
          who climbs up and peeks inside the cab. He's rugged,
          streetwise, perpetually bemused, -maybe Ed Norton and Bill
          Murray had a son...

</b>          She shrugs, trying to put her finger on it, and when Luke
          rolls up his T-shirt sleeves, she grins.

          passionately.

</b>          She walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it.

          up under the glove box and GRINS, pulling out a small stash

                    out here. You want moron? When my

                    I barely knew what was goin' on-
                    But I thought the tombstone was
                    really sad looking, so I painted
                    smiley faces and fish all over it.

</b>                    Liverpool was a veritable shagfest
                    when I was your age. A boulevard
                    of broken hearts. But eventually,
                    I found him.

                    place, just like the one where we
