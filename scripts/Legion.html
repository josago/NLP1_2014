</b>
<b>          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
</b>          Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life.
          A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The
          unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold.
          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

<b>                                WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>                      When I was a little girl, my mother
                      would remind me each night before
                      bed to be sure to open my heart to
                      God, for he was kind, merciful and
                      just. Things changed after my
                      father left a few years later,
                      leaving her to raise me and my
                      brothers alone in a little place
                      out on the edge of the Mojave
                      Desert. She never talked about a
                      kind and merciful God again.
                      Instead she spoke of a prophecy.
                      Of a time when all the world would
                      be covered in darkness and the fate
                      of Mankind would be decided. One
                      night I finally got up the courage
                      to ask my mother why God had
                      changed, why was he mad at his
                      children. "I don't know," she
                      said, tucking the covers around me,
                      "I guess he just got tired of all
                      the bullshit."
          And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED
          OUT, leaving us in:

<b>          DARKNESS...
</b>          A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS
          SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          A BLOOD RED MOON
</b>          reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the
          smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice
          something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,
          coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!

<b>          TWO BLACK BOOTS
</b>          land hard in the water...and we're in:

<b>                                                                      2.

<b>          EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
          pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly
          he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have
          been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,
          deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a
          fight.
          His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.
          He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick
          walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?
          A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems
          to motivate him.
          Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
          toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in
          time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,
          SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.
          He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash
          dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
          past.
          Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a
          MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.
          Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor
          sharp.
          Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare
          chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK
          TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.
          As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK
          WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,
          and then...

<b>          ...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO
</b>
<b>          WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
</b>          The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.
          The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.

<b>          A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...
</b>
<b>          ...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...
</b>
<b>          ...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
</b>          ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...

<b>          CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,
</b>
<b>          SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                     3.

</b>
<b>          EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER
</b>
          Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out
          of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront
          across the street.

<b>          "GUN & SPORT WORLD"
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER
</b>
          Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the
          sound of RAIN, then...
          SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a
          shower of glass.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.
          His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
          fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.
          His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
          shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is
          a living book. But the writing is in no language we
          recognize.
          He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
          OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.

<b>          FRESH. BLOODY.
</b>          He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,
          and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the
          cement floor around his feet.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the
          ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,
          his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life
          for this.
          Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
          Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.
          Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold.
          The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front
          doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get
          out of here?

<b>          INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME
</b>
          Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's
          BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.
          The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night.
          Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a
          deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the
          streetwalkers.

<b>                              BURTON
</b>                    Goddamn' animals. Nights like this
                    I wish I could take a match to this
                    city just so I could watch all
                    these motherfuckers burn.

<b>                              ESTEVEZ
</b>
<b>                        (LAUGHS)
</b>                    A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?
          Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious.

<b>                              BURTON
</b>                    A fresh start. That's what this
                    place needs.
          He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people
          they pass, picking them off one by one.

<b>                                  BURTON
</b>                    Pow!   Pow!     Pow!
          Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his
          partner, wary.

<b>                              ESTEVEZ
</b>                    Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so
                    happy we get to share beautiful
                    moments like this. They really
                    brighten my da--
          KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE
          just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.
          Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time
          to see...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly
          out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                      5.

<b>                              ESTEVEZ (O.S.)
</b>                    Freeze!
          Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car,
          crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael.

<b>                              ESTEVEZ
</b>                    Drop the bags! Hands on your head!
          In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO
          CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE.
          "Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!"
          The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                        (sensing their unease:)
                    It's starting. There isn't much
                    time.
          The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what
          the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.

<b>                              BURTON
</b>                    Shut the fuck up and drop the bags
                    now!
          Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.

<b>                              ESTEVEZ
</b>                    Hands on your head!    On your head!
          Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.

<b>                              BURTON
</b>                    Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
          Michael slowly turns around.    Calm.
          Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,
          FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible
          decision made.
          And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!
          In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him
          helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's
          Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off
          with Burton.
          Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.

<b>                              BURTON
</b>                    Let `em go!

<b>                                                                     6.

<b>                              BURTON
</b>                    I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--
          Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his
          throat like a skipping record.

<b>                               ESTEVEZ
</b>                    Burton!?
          THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the
          confusion.
          Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY
          QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive
          pressure were building inside him.
          And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH

<b>          BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE
</b>
<b>          CLOWN!
</b>          His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully
          in control.
          Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice
          GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.

<b>                              BURTON
</b>                    What are you doing, Michael?   These
                    weren't your orders.
          Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.

<b>                              ESTEVEZ
</b>                    What did you say?
          Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    I'm following my own orders now.

<b>                              BURTON
</b>                    Then you will die along with the
                    child.

<b>                              ESTEVEZ
</b>                    Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
          BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops,
          leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's
          faster, already FIRING back.
          Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window
          SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing.
          Smoke rising from his gun.
          With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags
          and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car.
          He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the
          FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a
          wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...

<b>          INT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN
</b>
          Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped
          bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got
          shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN
</b>
          A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the
          eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the
          trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in
          decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the
          trailers roof lines, marking the season.
          One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily
          out into the cool western morning. Home.
          Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a
          two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that
          Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.
          Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign
          glows like a beacon in the darkness:

<b>          "PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB"
</b>          A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.

<b>                              CHARLIE (O.S.)
</b>                    You okay, Jeep?
          Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about
          twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep
          from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's
          strikingly beautiful.

</b>                    It's just stress, Jeep, that's all.

          Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the

<b>          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY
</b>
          BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine
          roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in
          the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.
          The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm
          you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old
          plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and
          tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded
          diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off
          the Shopping Network.
          Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an
          ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine
          stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.
          You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer
          drinker.
          Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is
          cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed
          dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when
          your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The
          dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's
          hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.

<b>                              PERCY
</b>                    Lord as my witness, Bob, one of
                    these days that thing's gonna hit
                    you back.

<b>          WHACK!

<b>                              BOB
</b>                    Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We
                    got a special relationship here.

<b>          WHACK!
</b>
<b>                              PERCY
</b>                    Yeah, they got names for that kind
                    a relationship.
          The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the
          MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE".
          A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair
          and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the
          jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling
          as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that
          really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a
          billboard of rebellion.

          Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the
          diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA
          and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water.

</b>                    Howard, don't. You'll embarrass

                    of showing your ass off to the
                    entire world?
          The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard
          with a caustic smile.

<b>                               AUDREY
</b>                    Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping
                    to get double teamed by a couple of
                    meth head truckers in the bathroom

<b>                        (BEAT)
</b>                    Good thing we stopped here.
          And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches
          the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it.
          Howard turns back to his wife.   Rigid smile.

<b>                              HOWARD
</b>                    I feel satisfied with that answer.

          (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad
          boy.
          He passes a weathered road sign:

<b>          "ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES"
</b>          Kyle's expression says this is not good news.
          He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.   No signal.

          The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the
          lonely row of old gas pumps.
          Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in
          the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.
          Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and
          rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the
          SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.
          The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK
          parked in front of the garage with its hood up.
          Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and
          flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around.
          Which way is north?

          He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way
          out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in
          search of a pay phone.
          The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that
          it's been broken for ten years.
          Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing
          a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her
          very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look
          is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name
          tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".

          Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle
          takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.

          quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just
                    lost.
          Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he
          shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette
          back up to her lips. An awkward beat.

<b>                              KYLE
</b>                    Three seventy-five, huh?

          The DOOR JINGLES.   Charlie and Kyle enter.
          Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle. He notices her as
          well. How couldn't he? She's directing every ounce of sex
          appeal she has in his direction.
          Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in
          Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban
          nightmare.
          Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of
          smokes from underneath the counter.

          Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a
          living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north.

          He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands.       The
          sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention.
          He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off
          the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery
          how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that
          windshield.
          After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN
          ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal
          frame and wheels of a walker.
          The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on
          the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner
          with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches
          her disappear inside.

                    I take it?
          A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it
          away. But another one lands in its place.

<b>                                 CHARLIE
</b>                    Nope.
          Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real
          ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.   More
          FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food.
          Charlie is still trying to wave them away.

<b>                              GLADYS
</b>                    That's too bad.

          Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle
          glances over from the counter.

</b>                    Go to hell, lady.
          She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward
          the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.

          Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour
          her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are
          swarming now. How did so many get in here?
          Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of
          events.

          Sandra covers her mouth in shock.    Everybody in the diner is
          now focused on the old lady.
          Howard gets up from the booth.

          Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over.   Blood

          whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head
          sideways. THWACK!
          BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.   Impossibly, Gladys is
          still standing.
          She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE

          Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.

</b>          Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast,
          as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --

<b>          UPSIDE DOWN!
</b>          BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't
          track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in
          the ceiling, a rain of plaster.
          Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.

          Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear
          paralyzing him where he stands.

          Jeep slowly opens his eyes.   His gun's still cocked.
          Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet.
          He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his
          silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so
          shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing
          such serious heat.

          Sandra is on the floor with her husband.     Blood pours freely
          from his neck.
          Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --
          then he rushes to help.

          Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck,
          desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out
          between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid

          Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her

          A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and

          Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound.
          Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook.
          Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the
          tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle
          stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body --
          just in case.
          Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles
          from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from
          Percy's frying pan.

                    here, I'd say the old bag's been
                    dead for hours.
          Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged
          mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.

          Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the

          eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.

          A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild
          stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust
          clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug
          splattered windows.

          The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the
          diner.
          The three men see her moving toward the car.    Jeep's face
          goes slack.

</b>          Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those
          piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her,
          as if she was exactly who he expected to see.
          In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in
          front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.

          A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold.

          Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well
          kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others
          ease slightly.

                    This old lady just went crazy
                    inside my place here. She had
                    these teeth. Never seen anything
                    like `em. Practically bit a man in
                    half.
          Michael remains silent.       Doesn't seemed shocked in the least
          by what he's heard.

<b>                              BOB

                    Gotta say you don't exactly look
                    like a police officer. Even one
                    from L.A. Then again, you have to
                    be, right? I mean, who the hell'd
                    be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
          Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in
          kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the
          shotgun again.
          Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to
          the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic
          table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:

                    working here. The TV, the radio,
                    the phone...
          Michael just shakes his head.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    I'm running out of time.
          Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob
          blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.

<b>                               BOB

          In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's
          hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find
          himself holding air.
          He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun
          pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.

                    Tell `em you were only kidding!
          But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared.   He squeezes his
          eyes closed.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    Let `em go!
          Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction.
          Considering her.
          The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand
          and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra
          and Audrey.
          Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.

          looking good.
          No one BREATHES. That's when Kyle notices something out in
          the direction of the road.

          back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun,
          speechless.

<b>                               BOB
</b>                    Wait. I don't think that's such a
                    good idea.

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    Dad, I can handle it.

<b>                              BOB
</b>                        (to Michael)
                    He's just a kid --

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    I said, I can handle it!
          Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    He can handle it. He doesn't have
                    a choice.
          Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked
          everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the
          men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    If you want to live, you'll do
                    exactly as I say.
          He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.   He cocks a
          Glock and hands it to her.

<b>                               MICHAEL
</b>                    When you fire, you keep your thumb
                    off the slide. Don't hesitate.
                    Don't do anything brave. There's
                    no safety.
          He gives her a hard look.   She nods nervously.   Trusting him
          but not sure why.
          Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the
          others, then he bolts after Michael.
          Percy follows.   Then Charlie.
          Now it's only Jeep and his father left.

<b>                              BOB
</b>                    C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!

          A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road.

<b>          THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.       CLOSER.
</b>          He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.

<b>                                  JEEP
</b>                     Fuck it.
          And races after his father.

          Frantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of
          the door, sealing off the entrance.
          Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields.
          Window blinds are snap closed.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          THE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

</b>          The place is transformed. Locked up tight.        The ROAR OF

          Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap.
          She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to
          keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss.

          Sandra closes her eyes.        Struggling to believe it.
          Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into

          A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH
          THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face.
          Michael looks up at the ceiling.

          A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy
          and Kyle. They quickly take their places behind the
          "Paradise" sign. Pitch black surrounds them.
          The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone, leaving only the RUSH OF THE
          WIND coming up off the desert.

<b>                              KYLE

          Bob turns to Michael sharply.

<b>                              BOB
</b>                    Alright, Rambo. You got us up
                    here. Now you mind explaining what

          Michael is about to answer, when:

<b>                              PERCY
</b>                    Listen!
          Over the wind, another sound becomes audible.
          The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.

<b>                              PERCY
</b>                    You hear what I'm hearing?

<b>                              BOB
</b>                    Yeah...The hell is that?
          The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct.
          Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.
          But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with
          dread.

          TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the   darkness. And sure enough, an
          ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly   toward the diner. The EERIE
          CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from   a speaker on its roof. It's too
          dark to see who's behind the   wheel.

          Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the
          MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. If only he could
          stop shaking, it might be believable.
          Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the
          windows. The ICE CREAM TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS fan across the
          diner.
          Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows.
          Charlie stops next to Jeep. Senses him shaking. Rests a
          hand on his arm. And that seems to help...a little.
          Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE.

<b>                               HOWARD

          The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights
          facing the diner.
          Everyone aims their guns at the truck.     Tense.
          From the Ice Cream Truck...a DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the
          ground.
          MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to
          reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. Say
          hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN.
          He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he
          steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even
          more clearly.
          He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him.
          And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like
          taffy. If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him
          for some kind of spider. He surveys the diner, the garage,
          the roof -- assessing the situation.
          On the roof, the men wait for something to happen.

<b>                              KYLE

<b>                        (WHISPERS)
</b>                    Ah, he don't look that bad.
          The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof.      He heard.

<b>                                 KYLE
</b>                    Oh, shit.     Oh, shit.   Oh, shit.
          That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING

<b>          TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST! ROW
</b>          AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening
          sound of CRACKING OF BONES.
          From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth
          shattering HOWL.
          Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with
          fear.

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    Get ready!
          And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING
          SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal
          man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT.
          Michael aims.

<b>

<b>                                                                       46.

          his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching
          mess.
          Michael keeps his aim.    Waits.   The CALLIOPE music continues
          to play.

<b>                               KYLE

          Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A

          wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE

</b>          Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE!
          DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering.
          In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS

<b>          PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL
</b>          FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many

                     close to the windows!
          The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions.
          They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't
          actually touch the ground.
          From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow
          Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight.
          Their faces lighting up with each FLASH.
          SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from
          a sprinkler.
          BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't
          seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in
          their sheer numbers.
          With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the
          diner.

          Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch
          and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.

<b>                                 BOB
</b>                    Fuck!
          With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down
          for the ammo. Stretching... Further...

<b>          A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM

          tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she
          clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT.
          Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts
          to slip down toward her. She's coming fast!
          Percy sees his friend in trouble.

          Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the
          bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide
          even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he
          can't stop!

<b>          BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP
</b>
<b>          RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!
</b>          She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something
          akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM!
          The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing
          force halts Bob's slide.

          Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays
          on.
          But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more.
          Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!

          pounces on him.

          handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS
          rattle the plates on the shelves.
          Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the
          front windows.
          Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds.
          Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face.    Staring.

          ON CHARLIE staring at the window.    CLOSER.   Charlie's eyes go
          wide as --
          SMASH!   A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window.    Glass,
          sand and dust swirl in.
          Audrey and Sandra SCREAM.
          Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready.
          Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically
          for the intruder. It's so dark!

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    Where is it?!
          Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She
          looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's
          too much.

<b>                               AUDREY

          Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's
          got hold of his legs!   That gets Sandra's eyes open!

<b>                              SANDRA

</b>                    Howard!
          Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through
          the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about,
          desperately trying to grab a hold of something.
          Sandra scrambles after her husband.   Reaching for him.

<b>                               AUDREY
</b>                    Daddy!
          The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's
          outstretched hands. She has him!
          The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered
          window.   It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light
          falling across its face, reveals:
          A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age.   Her skin is a deathly
          blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.

<b>          
</b>          Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated
          flesh on her arms, neck and face. The self-inflicted wounds
          of a drug addict. Her voice is not QUITE HUMAN.

<b>                              TEENAGE GIRL

          Sandra screams, holds on.

<b>                              SANDRA
</b>                    No!
          Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's
          arms.
          Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but
          with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he
          discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms.
          Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched.   A human
          tug-of-war.

</b>                    Howard!
          Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie
          daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain
          leverage.

<b>          ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS

<b>          ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM!
</b>          Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window,
          losing her grip on Howard's belt.
          Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY
          LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to
          his baby girl.

          And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures
          suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she
          alone was their target.
          Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie,
          grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer.
          Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the
          window.

          Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death
          through the window. Jeep's losing her!

<b>          A FLASH OF STEEL.    SCHING!
</b>          Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like
          hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to
          their owners.
          Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a
          machine gun in the other. He lights up everything in his
          path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures
          SCREECH and flee into the night, having successfully taken
          their first victim.
          Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and
          Jeep scoot away from the window.
          Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going
          after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it out.

<b>                                 SANDRA

          Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from
          the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.

<b>                              SANDRA

          Sandra breaks down.

<b>          
</b>          As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain.       She
          clutches her belly. Winces.
          Jeep catches her arm to steady her.

          Charlie doesn't know how to respond.      She's about to say
          something when --
          Kyle rushes into the room.       A smile on his face.

<b>                              KYLE

          Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the
          adrenaline.

          Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a
          prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread
          around.
          Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls
          another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and
          places it in front of her.

          Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael
          nail broken table planks across the shattered window. He
          eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two

</b>          But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible
          black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are
          breathing.
          Sandra goes slack with horror.

<b>                              HOWARD

          Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES
          covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.

</b>                    Howard!
          Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it
          away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when
          Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.

          Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey
          hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy
          appears in the doorway.
          Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and
          that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION.
          Howard is there.    A few feet away.   Alive.
          Sandra races toward him.    Just behind her comes Percy.

<b>                                SANDRA
</b>                    Howard!
          And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL --
          -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying
          streams of dark fluid toward Sandra --
          -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her
          from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not
          stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door
          SLAMMING closed behind them.
          Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into
          the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground.
          But she's not fighting anymore.
          Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his
          back to the door, breathing heavily.

          at his dead friend. A broken man. Tears stream down his

          Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it
          looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never
          know.
          Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael
          never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at
          her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father
          making sure his child hasn't strayed too far.
          In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains
          her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio.

                    darkest hole imaginable. I
                    couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak.
                    I kept thinking this must be what
                    death is like. And when finally

                    wanted to, that I could decide to
                    end it like I'd planned. Then I'd
                    start to have that feeling again
                    and I knew I didn't have a choice.
                    Somehow this had already been
                    decided. And it made me hate this
                    thing that's been growing inside
                    me.
          A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:

</b>                    The only time my old man ever paid
                    attention to me was when I was
                    doing somethin' bad. So you know
                    what I did?

<b>                               AUDREY
</b>                    What?

<b>                              KYLE
</b>                    I got really good at being bad.
          She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He
          wipes a tear from her cheek.
          She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately.
          His hands trace over her body.
          She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control.
          She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up.
          It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over.
          She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head
          back. Further.
          Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come
          to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant
          red word "Paradise" illuminated above them.
          Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's
          FLUORESCENTS flicker on.

          All at once the entire diner COMES BACK TO LIFE.
          The jukebox WHIRS ON, filling the room with Merle Haggard's
          "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive".
          Bob's TV glows with bright rolling STATIC.
          The electric fan spins on above the grill.

          The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you
          didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business
          as usual. Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the
          dramatic change.

<b>                              AUDREY

          Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face.    Then he
          pulls out his silver 45.

                    Just in case.
          The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off
          the highway to stop at the pumps.

          They aim their weapons at the vehicle.
          A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car.
          He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the
          coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and
          YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.

          A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look
          out over the back side of the diner.
          AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast.
          Kyle looks urgently back at the family.    The father lifts the
          pump. Flips the lever.

<b>                              KYLE
</b>                    It's a trap. They saw them coming
                    and turned on the lights. It's a
                    fucking trap!
          Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.

<b>                             KYLE AND AUDREY
</b>                    Hey! Get back in your car!      It's a
                    trap!
          But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING
          WIND as he pumps the gas.
          Kyle fires his gun in the air.   BLAM!   BLAM!     BLAM!
          At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the
          roof.   His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO
          HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but
          he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe.
          Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner.

<b>                              AUDREY
</b>                    They're not gonna make it.
          The father dashes to the driver's side.    He throws open the
          door.
          But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time
          to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM.
          His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows.
          Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that
          surround the vehicle like swarming insects.
          The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from
          the vehicle by skeletal hands.

                    Wait! You'll hit them too!
          So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto
          the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the
          ground in front of the diner.

<b>                              AUDREY

          Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the
          woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on.
          He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything
          that comes at him.

          The sound of a gun COCKING.
          Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.

          The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably
          agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display.
          He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures
          huddled around them.
          He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively
          covering his face.
          Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms.

          Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening.
          The creatures have stopped coming at him.
          In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting.
          Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly
          wrong.

          The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears

          She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing.
          The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an
          eerie calm for someone so young.

          Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the
          diner. Blocked by advancing creatures.
          They're everywhere.    She's trapped.
          She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS.
          Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly
          closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK!

<b>                                 YOUNG BOY
</b>                       C'mon, don't be scared. I just
                       wanna play with your baby.
          That's it.    She's backed against the end of the counter!
          The boy raises the knife to strike.
          Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in
          front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN.
          CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's
          hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the
          blade.
          The knife CLATTERS to the ground.
          The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but
          there's no knife.
          Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his
          THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps.
          Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the
          boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her.
          Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie,
          guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                       Are you hurt?
          Charlie shakes her head no.

</b>          Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly

</b>                      Dad!
          Jeep can't get a clear shot.       Bob's gasping for air.
          Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's
          back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.

<b>                                   MICHAEL

          creature into the air.
          Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF
          GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner.
          And then in moments...      All is QUIET.
          BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.       She
          WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach.

          Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with

          The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger
          -- closer.
          Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below.

          A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as
          if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.

<b>                              JEEP

          Audrey arrives with more steaming water.

          Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the ARMY OF CREATURES has
          closed within a hundred yards of the diner. Their ranks
          stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness.

<b>                              JEEP

<b>                              BOB
</b>                    I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be

          Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob
          pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears
          filling his eyes.

          Amidst the dirt and darkness, Charlie lets out a final
          agonizing SCREAM...
          ...and then comes a BABY'S CRIES.   Audrey, eyes wide, holds
          up the CHILD. Stunned. Elated.

<b>                              AUDREY

                    you did it!
          Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the
          baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace
          it or be terrified by it. A commitment she's not yet ready
          to make, even at this late hour.

<b>                              AUDREY

<b>                        (CONFUSED)
</b>                    It's okay. The baby's okay.
          Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    I don't...I...
          Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    Take him... Give her a minute.
          Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to
          soothe him by pacing around the diner.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                        82.

          Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS.      Menacing.
          Closer.
          Audrey   reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio,
          trying   to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out
          of the   STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing
          SILENT   NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm.
          Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up.     She stares
          at him, a burning spite in her eyes.

<b>                                CHARLIE

<b>                                MICHAEL
</b>                      No. Killing the child would have
                      ended the war before it had begun.
                      Now, at least, he will have a
                      chance to grow up, a chance to lead
                      the world out of darkness.
          Those words provide her little comfort.

<b>                                CHARLIE
</b>                      And what happens until then...?

<b>                                MICHAEL
</b>                      You'll need to teach him how.
          Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.

<b>                                CHARLIE
</b>                      What makes you think I can do that?
                      What makes you think I want to do
                      that? If he's so important, why
                      don't you take him?

<b>                                MICHAEL

                      means.
          Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey
          approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. Despite
          how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to
          see her in such a demoralized state.

          mother. But we HOLD here and...
          DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are

          THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky.

</b>                    The Possessed can't come near the
                    child, so He sent someone that can.
                    Someone like me.

<b>                                 BOB
</b>                    Who?

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come
                    to do what I wouldn't.
          ON JEEP as the realization hits him.

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    Your orders...
          Michael looks at Jeep.

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    You were the one who was supposed
                    to kill the baby? That was the
                    order you didn't obey.
          Michael nods grimly.    Charlie looks urgently at Michael.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    What's he talking about?
          The baby CRIES LOUDER.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    Michael, what the hell's he talking
                    about?!

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    There was never meant to be a
                    Second Coming. But we've just
                    changed that. The child lives.
                    The future is unwritten. There's
                    still hope.
          Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.

<b>                                 CHARLIE
</b>                    Audrey...?
          Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...

<b>          ...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND
</b>
<b>          SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS!
</b>          Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door.
          Hers is the face of madness.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                    85.

<b>                               SANDRA
</b>                     You heard what he said. They just
                     want the baby. Maybe if we just
                     give it to them, then they'll let
                     us go!
          Michael cocks his gun.   Points it at Sandra.

<b>          THE HORN BLARES ONCE MORE, DEAFENING, SHAKING EVERYTHING IN
</b>
<b>          THE DINER. IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
</b>          Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes.

<b>                               CHARLIE
</b>                     Give him to me!

<b>                               SANDRA
</b>                     Why?! You never wanted him in the
                     first place!
          Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words
          rattling her to the very core.

<b>                                CHARLIE
</b>                     No...   I...
          Sandra is almost to the front door.

<b>                               SANDRA
</b>                     It's just one baby.   Just one.

<b>          CRASH!   THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES.
</b>          A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner.
          Sandra is blinded.   She raises a hand to block the light.
          And that's when Michael fires.    BLAM!
          Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her
          forehead, and...

<b>          ...THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS!
</b>          Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION...   And
          everything suddenly goes very QUIET.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                     86.
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Michael fires again.   Blowing Sandra's body back through the
          doorway.
          Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air.
          The time for Jeep to act is now!
          Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere
          inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see...
          The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the
          spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS.
          Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the
          diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before.
          This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle
          scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly
          insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather
          they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine.
          The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision.
          And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his
          striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake them
          for brothers.
          His name is GABRIEL.
          Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical
          looking MACE in his powerful hands.
          And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the
          mace arcing down at Jeep.
          Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the
          floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND.
          Gabriel brings the mace up again.   Jeep won't be so lucky
          twice.

<b>                              BOB (O.S.)
</b>                    Sonuvabitch!
          Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing.
          Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching
          himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind
          him.
          But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run
          with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the
          child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she
          pulls the child protectively to her chest.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                    87.
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around
          like a deadly, RAZOR SHARP FAN!
          Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face.
          His gun falling from his hands.
          Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.

<b>                               JEEP
</b>                    No!
          With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the
          diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the
          stove.
          Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into
          the fray.

<b>                               MICHAEL
</b>                    No, Jeep! You must protect the
                    child now!

<b>                               JEEP
</b>                    Me?!   What about you?

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    My path ends here. You are the
                    true protector. You always have
                    been.
          Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    But I don't know what to do!

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    Find the Prophets.   Learn to read
                    the instructions.
          Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face
          Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words.

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    Prophets? What Prophets?   What
                    instructions?!
          And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to
          Michael's Police Cruiser.
          Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the
          baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes
          his hand around the keys, determination building.

<b>                               JEEP
</b>                    C'mon!

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                  88.
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray.

<b>                                 CHARLIE
</b>                    Wait!     We can't leave him!

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    We have no choice!    We have to get
                    to Red Rock!
          He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office.
          Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the
          ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood.
          Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched
          hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a
          BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove.
          Jeep is terrified.

<b>                                 JEEP
</b>                    Dad!
          Jeep tries to help him up.

<b>                              BOB
</b>                    Leave me, Jeep.     My place is here,
                    remember?

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    But Dad...!
          Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:

<b>                                 BOB
</b>                    Run.
          And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.

          Audrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door.

          Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like
          enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible
          family conflict.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                    89.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You
                    were always so eager to please Him.

<b>                              GABRIEL
</b>                    Unlike you...the rebellious son.
                        (noticing Michael's scars)
                    Pity about your wings. They would
                    have helped you now.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    To not feel their burden...is a
                    dream.

<b>                              GABRIEL
</b>                    You think you can defy Him and not

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    The child lives. What happens to
                    me doesn't matter now.

<b>                               GABRIEL
</b>                    Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You
                    can help them sneak out the back
                    door, but they won't escape.

<b>                        (BEAT)
</b>                    And neither will you, brother.
          Michael slowly approaches Gabriel.

<b>                               MICHAEL
</b>
<b>                        (SOFT)
</b>                    I'm not running anymore.
          Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face.    This was not
          what he was expecting.

<b>                              MICHAEL

          A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens.

<b>                              GABRIEL
</b>                    There is no other way...
          He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! --
          LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it
          wasn't bad-ass enough.
          And the fight begins.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                    90.
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems
          under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior
          weapon.
          With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering
          speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The
          place is getting absolutely shot to hell.
          Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings
          the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches.
          Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to
          fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight
          into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in
          Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he
          lands on the counter.
          Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest,
          sending him fluttering back.
          Michael thrusts himself to his feet.   Gabriel recovers, jabs
          again.
          Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support
          and lifts his body just above the deadly spike.
          Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him.
          Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of
          punches.
          Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.   He clumsily lifts
          his mace and thrusts with it.
          Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a
          wall.
          Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones.
          A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing
          back, losing his grip on the weapon.
          Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back.
          Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael
          off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking
          the life out of Gabriel.

          Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael.    He
          fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent.
          Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't
          hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom.
          Unbelievably Michael is still holding on.
          Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom
          mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael.
          Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner.
          Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull.
          Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more.   It's a brutal
          struggle.
          Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms
          reach.
          He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this
          angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's
          strength is giving way. Michael is winning.
          Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the
          mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go
          wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them
          both through.
          Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward.
          Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest.   Right
          through his heart.
          Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly
          as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood
          left in this guy.
          Michael falls to his knees.   Weakening.
          Gabriel looms over Michael.   Michael looks up at him, blood
          leaking from his mouth.

          Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward

          He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive

          It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING

<b>          JEEP SLAMS ON THE BREAKS, SENDING GABRIEL AND AUDREY SHOOTING
</b>
<b>          FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD LIKE A BULLET.
</b>          The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road
          with a sickening crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. RED ROCK PARK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and
          careening into a large rock formation.
          This ride is over.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Jeep's side of the car is crushed.   Blood is running down his
          forehead.
          Charlie crawls up from the floor.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    C'mon, Jeep!

</b>
<b>                                                                    100.

<b>                                CHARLIE
</b>                    Jeep!
          She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.

<b>                                JEEP
</b>                    The baby?

<b>                                CHARLIE
</b>                    Alive.

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    And what about...

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    Nothing could have survived that.

<b>                              JEEP

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved
                    us. Now c'mon, we gotta go!
          Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from
          the demolished Cruiser.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - PRE-DAWN
</b>
          Jeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the
          long climb up the ridge.
          Charlie looks up.
          STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky.   Breathtaking.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    How can this happen?

<b>                                JEEP
</b>                    What?

<b>                               CHARLIE
</b>                    How can this happen in a world so
                    beautiful?
          Jeep follows her gaze to the sky.
          Endless stars.    Confounding.
          Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.

<b>

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    C'mon, we're almost there.
          They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --

<b>          GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM!
</b>          Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way
          just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up
          a cloud of dust.
          Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has
          done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away.
          Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including
          a large part of his head, revealing that under his human
          visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE.
          Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM!
          Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's
          hand.
          Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin,
          rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel
          knocks Jeep savagely to the ground.
          Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at
          Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt
          again.
          Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his
          fists. This kid will simply not give up.
          Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,
          shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear
          off the ground.

<b>                              GABRIEL
</b>                    So brave. So pointless. You
                    should have worried more about
                    saving yourself.
          Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at
          Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope.
          Charlie watches in horror.

<b>                               CHARLIE
</b>                    Stop!   Please! Don't kill him!
          But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing
          consciousness. The battle is lost.

<b>                              GABRIEL
</b>                    Go to sleep...
          Jeep's eyes flutter.   He's almost gone.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                   102.

</b>                    Stop it!   I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY!
          This gets Gabriel's attention.
          Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to
          him.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                    I don't want this responsibility!
          Tears run down her face.   She's dead fucking serious.
          Gabriel lets go of Jeep.   He falls to the ground, gasping
          desperately for air.

<b>                              JEEP
</b>                    Charlie, no!
          Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.

<b>                              GABRIEL
</b>                    "And as the child's cries are
                    extinguished, an eternal darkness
                    at last descended upon the world."
          He peels the cloth back, revealing...

<b>          THE GRENADE.
</b>          He spins around to face Charlie.
          She's holding the pin.

<b>          KABOOM!
</b>
<b>          GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS.
</b>          The creature is gone at last.
          The sound of a BABY COOING.
          Charlie picks the child up out of the brush.
          She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make
          their way to the top of the ridge.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - DAWN
</b>
          Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below.
          ON THEIR FACES, reacting to what they see.
          Charlie takes Jeep's hand in hers.

<b>

<b>                                                                      103.

<b>                               CHARLIE
</b>                     Yep, we sure did.
          And now we see it too:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
</b>          Vast.   Barren.   No signs of life.
          No resistance force.    No nothing.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          ON JEEP AND CHARLIE
</b>          Taking it in.     Breathing hard.

<b>                               JEEP
</b>                     I'm sure they're just over the next
                     ridge.
          He glances at Charlie.    Worry in her eyes.

<b>                               CHARLIE
</b>                     What if we're on our own now?

<b>                                JEEP
</b>                     Don't be afraid.    We'll be okay.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>                     Believe me.
          At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes.       Sees a
          confidence in them she's never seen before.
          And she leans in and kisses him.      Tender.
          When they part, Jeep stares back at her with surprise.      Then
          the surprise melts into a smile.
          And they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a
          view once again of --

<b>

<b>          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
</b>          A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains. The

<b>          INT. CAR - DRIVING - MORNING - WEEKS LATER

          Jeep is at the wheel. He looks aged, scarred from the
          experience. His exposed arms are completely covered with the
          INTRICATE WRITING...The Instructions. The boy he once was is
          gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him.

<b>                              CHARLIE'S VOICE

                    everything seemed lost...
          Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms.
          It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy
          family. Of course you'll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF
          WEAPONRY in the back seat.

          image of maternal bliss.
