<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
          On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
          with a billion stars.
          Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
          BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
          breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

<b>          1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1
</b>
          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
          amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
          down the street and heads out of town.

<b>          2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2
</b>
          The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
          at the sky.
          JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
          constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
          spare parts of other devices.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Hurry!
          We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
          Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
          well, rubbing his head.

<b>          JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh-- watch your head.

<b>                         SELVIG
</b>          Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"�
          of yours supposed to look like?

<b>                         JANE
</b>          It's a little different each time.
          Once it looked like, I don't know,
          melted stars, pooling in a corner
          of the sky. But last week it was a
          rolling rainbow ribbon--

          Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
          my gloves, will you?
          Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
          a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.

<b>          JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Not until you see it!

<b>                         SELVIG
</b>          (re: the gloves)
          I recognize those. Think how proud
          he'd be to see you now.
          Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Thank you.

<b>                         SELVIG
</b>          For what?

<b>                         JANE
</b>          The benefit of the doubt.
          The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
          they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.

<b>          JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          It's never taken this long before.
          Darcy calls up from the front seat.

<b>          DARCY (O.S.)
</b>          Can I turn on the radio?

<b>                         JANE
</b>          (an edge to her voice)
          Sure, if you like rocking out to
          KFRM, "All agriculture, all the
          time."�
          Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

<b>          3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3
</b>
          The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
          equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
          together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
          handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
          frustrated Jane with sympathy.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          The anomalies are always
          precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
          She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
          tracking occurrences and patterns.

<b>          JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          The last seventeen occurrences have
          been predictable to the minute... I
          just don't understand.
          Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
          She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
          the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          Jane?
          Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
          champagne begins to vibrate.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          There's got to be some new
          variable... Or an equipment
          malfunction...
          The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
          them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          I don't think there's anything
          wrong with your equipment...
          The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
          shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
          They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
          the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
          everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

<b>          DARCY (CONT'D)
</b>          Jane?

<b>                         JANE

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          I think you want to see this.
          Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
          the desert --

<b>          MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
</b>          Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Holy. Shatner.

<b>                         SELVIG

<b>                         JANE
</b>          No-- yes! Let's go!

<b>          4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4
</b>
          The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
          event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
          out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
          The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
          her, yanks her back in.

<b>          5 INT. SUV 5

          Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Isn't this great?!
          A thought strikes her.

<b>          JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          You're seeing it too, right? I'm
          not crazy?

<b>                         SELVIG

          The SUV lurches.

<b>          6 EXT. DESERT 6
</b>
          Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
          out of the clouds comes --

<b>          AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
</b>          Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
          thousand freight trains as it touches down.

<b>          7 INT. SUV 7
</b>
          Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
          enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
          into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
          window, TAPING the storm.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          You've gotta get us closer so I can
          take a magnetic reading.
          Darcy laughs.

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          Yeah, right! Good one!
          (then, realizing)
          Oh God, you're serious...

<b>                         JANE
</b>          You want those college credits or
          not?

<b>          8 EXT. SUV 8
</b>
          The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
          leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
          two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
          take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
          strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
          them with a terrifying intensity.

<b>          9 INT. SUV 9
</b>
          The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
          the wheel, starts to head away.

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          Keep the credits. I'll intern at
          Burger King.

<b>                         JANE

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          Saving our lives!
          Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
          struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --

<b>                         A MAN
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
          Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
          slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
          The SUV swerves -- but too late.

<b>          10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10
</b>
          The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
          him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

<b>          11 INT. SUV 11
</b>
          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
          They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
          A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

<b>          12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12
</b>
          The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
          man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
          charred and blackened.

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          I think that was legally your
          fault.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Get the first aid kit.
          Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
          next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
          She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
          clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
          long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
          features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
          the life back into him.

<b>          JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.
          Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
          his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
          azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
          them.
          For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
          The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
          freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.

</b>          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.
          A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
          She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

<b>                         SELVIG
</b>          Immediately, Jane.
          Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
          above their heads. A thought strikes her.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
          glowing remnants of the storm, and into:

<b>          13 EXT. SPACE 13
</b>
          EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
          resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

<b>          HEIMDALL (V.O.)
</b>          Questions, they've always asked
          questions -- this race called man,
          on this planet they call earth.
          Passionately longing to know how
          they are connected to the heavens.

          We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
          cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
          galaxy.

<b>          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          In ages past, they looked to us as
          gods, for indeed so many times we
          saved them from calamity. We tried
          to show them how their world was
          but one of the Nine Realms of the
          Cosmos, linked to all others by the
          branches of Yggdrasil...
          We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
          sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
          shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
          out into the black void of space.

<b>          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
          a universe of wonder, beauty, and
          terror that they barely
          comprehended.
          We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
          a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

<b>          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          But for all their thirst for
          knowledge, they let our lessons

          Where did he come from? He came
          from us, the proudest race of
          warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
          He came from this -- the greatest
          Realm the universe has ever known.
          We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
          over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
          what's on the other side:

          The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an

          out before it.
          We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE

          Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a

</b>          Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
          could be a great King...
          Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
          synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
          as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
          trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
          sheer will.

          Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
          A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

          Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
          hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
          fire lit room.
          Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
          against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
          recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
          Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
          An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
          He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
          below.

          The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
          intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
          length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
          He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
          the Hall.
          We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
          shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
          horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
          from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
          horned headpiece.
          Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
          a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
          throne room.

</b>          That wasn't nerves, brother. It
          was the rage of battle. How else
          could I have fought my way through
          a hundred warriors and pulled us
          out alive?
          The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
          Thor.

<b>                         LOKI

          tricks.
          The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
          it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
          EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
          across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
          goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

<b>          THOR (CONT'D)

          Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
          back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

<b>          THOR (CONT'D)

          He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

          Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
          He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
          liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
          brother's shoulder.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Thank you.
          The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

</b>          Give us a kiss.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Stop.
          Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

          event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
          stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
          eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
          FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his

          HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
          of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and

          Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
          Attendant quickly backs away.
          From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her

          Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
          holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
          him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
          Ruler of Asgard.
          Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
          casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
          seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
          A murmur spreads through the crowd.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          (sotto, to Loki)
          Where is he?

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          He said he'd be along.
          Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          What?

<b>                         SIF
</b>          He wants to make an entrance.

</b>          Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
          he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
          like he's ready to feed him to his
          ravens.

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          I wouldn't worry. Father will
          forgive him. He always does.

          Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
          lower level --

<b>                         MJOLNIR
</b>          Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
          behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
          CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
          before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
          adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.

<b>                         SIF
</b>          Oh, please.
          Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

          As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
          breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
          warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
          something's not right.
          They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
          hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
          pedestal.
          LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
          SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

          Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
          of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
          Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
          her. She can't help but smile.
          Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
          The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
          authority.
          He raises Gungnir before him.

<b>                         ODIN
</b>          Gungnir. Its aim is true, its

          since the time of the Great

          The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
          strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
          catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
          and BLUE-SKINNED.
          One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
          to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
          Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
          standing in the shadows behind it.
          As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
          They turn back around.
          Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

          The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
          their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
          hall.
          Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
          with pride.

          Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE

          Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
          Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
          stop short.
          Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
          We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
          clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
          remains on the floor.
          They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
          Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
          creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
          It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

          Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
          the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
          the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
          Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.

          ready their battle gear for their journey.
          Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.

</b>
          Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
          the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
          most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

          Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
          mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
          ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
          Observatory.

<b>          29 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29
</b>
          The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
          Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
          them, blocking their way, staring them down.
          There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
          Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
          intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
          glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

<b>                         LOKI

          Heimdall stares him down.

<b>                         HEIMDALL
</b>          For ages have I guarded Asgard and
          kept it safe from those who would
          do it harm. In all that time,

          watch -- until this day. I wish to
          know how that happened.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Then tell no one where we've gone
          until we've returned.
          Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
          pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
          him.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG

          Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
          platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
          at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.

          Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
          apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

<b>          31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31

          The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
          the Observatory.

<b>          32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32
</b>
          Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
          Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
          section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
          sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
          the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
          The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
          and his five comrades stand.

          Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
          grins.

          The others join him at his side, then step towards the
          Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
          changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
          elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
          off the platform and inside the vortex.

<b>          33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33
</b>
          A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
          out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
          and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
          imprinted on the ice around them.

          Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
          grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
          precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
          inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

<b>                         THOR

          With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
          ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          This belt! This belt is now my
          lucky belt! I will never remove

          Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
          at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
          is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
          apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
          and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
          and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
          city lies in the distance.

          Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

          The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
          shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
          looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
          Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

          She and Thor share a grin.
          The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
          structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
          warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
          central plaza.

          Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
          Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
          FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.

<b>          35 EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35

          The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
          the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
          The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
          A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.

          The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.

<b>          JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)

          Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
          where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
          waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
          proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
          his people have endured.

</b>          I demand answers.
          Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.

          by the Jotun King's words.

          Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.

<b>                         LAUFEY
</b>          And why have you come here? To
          make peace? You long for battle.
          You crave it. I see you for what

<b>                         THOR
</b>          This boy has grown tired of your
          mockery.
          Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
          front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
          Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
          tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
          him.

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          Thor, stop and think. Look around

          Laufey steps out of the shadows.

<b>          LAUFEY (CONT'D)

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          We will accept your most gracious
          offer.
          The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
          a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
          breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant
          nearby mutters under his breath.

          coming.

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          Damn.
          In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
          the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
          draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
          Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG

          ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
          around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
          SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

<b>                         FANDRAL
</b>          I'm hoping that's just decorative.
          Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
          Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
          separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
          around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
          this.

<b>                         HOGUN
</b>          Shut up!
          Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
          loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
          A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
          hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
          mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
          hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
          him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
          back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
          with his mace.
          Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
          double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.

<b>                         SIF
</b>          If you don't treat me like a lady,
          I won't act like a lady!
          She takes out the Jotun.
          Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
          the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
          swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
          The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
          out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
          crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          (to the falling Giant)
          Pathetic.
          He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
          either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
          once.
          Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
          The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
          punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
          long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
          front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
          Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Come on! At least make it a
          challenge for me!
          He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
          tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
          rises, grins.

<b>          THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          Now that's more like it!
          He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
          head over heels.
          Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
          back to his grasp.

<b>          THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          (re: the fallen Brute)
          Ugly and stupid.
          Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
          ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
          Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
          sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
          the chest. The Jotun falls dead.

<b>                         SIF
</b>          (to Hogun, re: knife)
          I'm so glad I taught him how to do
          that!
          Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
          hits in.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          You may want to put some ice on
          that!
          The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
          a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
          Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

<b>          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
</b>          You may be taller, but I'm wider!
          Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
          flying.
          Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
          sending him crashing to the ground.

<b>          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
</b>          It's not too late for you to
          surrender.
          Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
          bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
          Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
          Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.

          Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
          ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
          Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
          to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
          opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
          out a small FLASK.
          Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
          to his comrades.

<b>          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't let them grab hold of you!
          He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
          battle.
          Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
          stops mid ice layer.
          The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
          and the warrior drops to one knee.
          Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
          quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
          her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
          chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.

<b>          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
</b>          (on his belly)
          Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
          had him!

<b>                         SIF
</b>          Of course you did.
          Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
          them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
          bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
          the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
          out.

          A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
          FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
          Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
          goes.

</b>          Hang on!
          Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
          Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
          worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
          close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

<b>                         HOGUN
</b>          Watch the legs!

          Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
          freeing Hogun's feet.
          Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.

<b>                         FANDRAL
</b>          You really think your icicles are a
          match for Asgardian steel?
          Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
          away.

<b>          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
</b>          Fair enough.
          Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
          sword and snaps it in half.

<b>          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
</b>          Could we stop just a moment while I
          get another sword?
          Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
          then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
          the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
          through with his own weapon.
          The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
          pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
          forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
          rendering him helpless.

          Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
          felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
          unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
          them off.
          Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          That's unfortunate.
          He hurries to his wounded comrade.

<b>                         FANDRAL
</b>          I may need a bit of help. Not a
          good look, is it?

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          Just try not to bleed.

<b>                         FANDRAL

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          Flawless.
          Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
          stalagmite.
          Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
          Giants.
          The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
          hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
          grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
          his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
          Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
          of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
          -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
          painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
          The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
          unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
          distraction, KICKS the Giant.

          Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
          the Jotuns around him.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Come on!
          But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
          Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
          from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
          Mjolnir falls to the ground.
          A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
          ground, to no avail.
          Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
          slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
          leave.
          From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
          it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
          palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
          wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
          The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
          feet.

<b>                         LOKI

          spring!
          They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
          shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
          awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
          Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.

</b>          Thor, we must go!
          Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
          mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
          look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
          of battle.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Then go!

<b>                         THOR

          The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
          around them.

<b>                         SIF
</b>          Thor!
          But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          Run!
          Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
          the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
          chase.
          Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
          The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
          disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

<b>                         MOMENT --
</b>
<b>          THOR'S FIST

          He opens his hand, beckoning.
          One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
          him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
          the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
          raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
          with all his might.
          KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
          channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
          Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
          shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.

          But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
          shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
          where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
          beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

<b>          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          Likely killed us all!
          As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
          mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
          quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
          The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
          a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
          move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
          Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
          raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
          the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
          comrades.

<b>                         THOR

          Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
          But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of
          the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
          many, even for a Thunder God.

          Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
          The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
          ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
          down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
          comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
          all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

<b>                         ODIN ALLFATHER

          The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
          stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
          Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
          his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
          react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
          to-face with Odin.
          Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
          about to happen.
          Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
          Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
          not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of
          earshot of the others.

          actions of a boy. Treat them as
          such. You and I can stop this
          before there's further bloodshed.
          Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
          blade at the end of his arm.

<b>                         LAUFEY

          Odin looks grim, determined.

<b>                         ODIN
</b>          So be it.
          Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
          Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
          the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
          in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
          The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
          fleeing Jotuns with delight.

          Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
          Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops
          the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the
          hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
          Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          "We?"�

<b>                         SELVIG
</b>          I flew all the way out here --
          might as well make myself useful.
          This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
          inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
          rack-mounted server.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          You know what would be really

          friend at LIGO?

<b>                         SELVIG

</b>          If I'm right, their observatory
          must have picked up gravitational
          waves during last night's event.

<b>                         SELVIG
</b>          Meaning?
          Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Meaning these anomalies might
          signify something bigger.

<b>                         SELVIG
</b>          How "big"� are we talking about?
          Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
          the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
          appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
          covered with stars.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          I think the lensing around the

          Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

          Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Yes. But not our stars.
          She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
          excitement.

<b>          JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          This is the star alignment for our
          quadrant, this time of year. So
          unless Ursa Minor decided to take
          the day off... those are someone
          else's constellations.
          Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
          Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
          the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
          image catches her eye.

<b>                         DARCY
</b>          Hey, check it out.
          Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.

</b>          Is that...?

<b>                         JANE
</b>          I think I left something at the
          hospital.
          As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
          funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
          of a MAN.

          Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his

</b>          Did you see what he did in there?
          I don't know if finding him is the

</b>
          Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
          shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
          ROARING central fire.
          Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
          STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
          carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
          the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
          comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
          Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
          Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
          blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
          Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
          Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
          its normal color.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG

          for what he did.

<b>                         SIF
</b>          Loki, you're the only one who can
          help Thor now. You must go to the
          Allfather and convince him to
          change his mind!

</b>          And if I do, then what? I love
          Thor more dearly than any of you,
          but you know what he is. He's
          arrogant. He's reckless. He's
          dangerous. You saw how he was
          today. Is that what Asgard needs
          from its King?
          The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
          leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

<b>                         SIF
</b>          He may speak about the good of
          Asgard, but he's always been
          jealous of Thor.

<b>                         VOLSTAGG
</b>          True, but we should be grateful to
          him. He did save our lives.

<b>                         HOGUN
</b>          Laufey said there were traitors in
          the House of Odin.
          The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.

<b>                         FANDRAL
</b>          Why is it every time you choose to
          speak, it has to be something dark
          and ominous?

<b>                         HOGUN

          Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
          sitting on its stand.
          He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
          between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
          blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
          The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
          Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
          metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
          the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.

          lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
          watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a

          One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
          the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the

          They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
          PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
          TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain
          from the back of the truck.
          He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes

          Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
          eyes.

<b>          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
</b>          You're a good son.
          Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
          really feels.

<b>          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
</b>          We mustn't lose hope that your
          father will return to us. And your

          Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          What hope is there for Thor?

</b>          There's always a purpose to
          everything your father does. Thor
          may yet find a way home.
          Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
          the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
          hurriedly approaching.

<b>          THE EINHERJAR GUARD
</b>          Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
          the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
          baffled.

          The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
          EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels
          before Loki, offers the spear to him.

          Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the

          Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local

          huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates --
          pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
          Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

          flustered, looks away.

<b>          JANE (CONT'D)
</b>          Maybe start with how you got inside

          hungry.
          Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
          coffee.

          A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at

          Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
          Townies with interest.

<b>                         TOWNIE PETE
</b>          They're saying some kind of

</b>          We were having a good time with it

          A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors

          illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a
          large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of

          The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver
          across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson
          slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a
          shotgun at Thor.
          Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and
          thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
          Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.

          A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
          the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
          As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
          rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
          ground.
          Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the
          fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
          more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
          cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
          Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
          entrance tube to the center of the site.
          A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
          see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
          right on him.
          Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
          raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
          He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
          catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
          hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
          the ATV's spotlight.
          Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
          the wheel to protect himself.
          The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
          entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
          Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
          the site entrance.

          The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches

          The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
          straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
          inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
          tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
          The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
          it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

          hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
          ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
          backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
          Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
          Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through

          From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the

          He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
          His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging
          around it.
          Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,
          one story up.

          As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow
          brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The
          crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,
          his interest piqued.
          Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane

          Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand
          around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the
          hammer doesn't move.
          Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail
          -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all
          his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm
          and lightning above him.
          Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing
          RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.
          But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his
          knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing
          runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.
          Coulson looks on, disappointed.
          SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.

          As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or
          care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the
          rain -- a man broken, lost.
          From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment
          room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue
          to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive
          damage Thor's done to it during the melee.

          glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.

          Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
          FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
          routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
          in time with the song.

          Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
          Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
          straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
          WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
          Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to

          bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
          way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig

          sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
          Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by

          the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
          SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
          towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
          still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
          Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his
          massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,

          As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him
          on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the

          The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg
          SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually
          work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It
          lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs
          apologetically.
          The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
          smashing into them, when --

<b>                         SIF
</b>          Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and
          plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
          The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its
          faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a
          brief moment of hope.
          But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
          again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
          Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
          degrees to face its attackers.
          The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
          of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
          rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
          staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
          Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
          unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
          in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
          free, landing in the middle of the street.

          Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
          time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
          A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
          and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
          they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
          impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

          Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
          stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
          for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
          pouch and races back.
          He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
          useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Come on... give me one!
          Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
          intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
          the end of the iron rod.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          What are you doing? What is that?
          As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
          Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
          piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
          reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
          completely.
          Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
          lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
          reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
          flesh.

<b>                         SELVIG

          Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on

          yourself.
          At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
          with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
          towards them.
          Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
          safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
          and Fandral.

          The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
          drag him away from the battlefield.
          After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
          tosses Sif's shield aside.
          He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely

          Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
          The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
          swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
          of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
          Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
          Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
          The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,

          Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
          Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
          him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
          unleash its fiery blast.

          hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
          vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
          Clouds form in the sky above.
          Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
          straight up into the air like a rocket.

          Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
          Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
          God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
          force winds.
          Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The

          It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
          locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
          straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
          Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
          overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
          Destroyer.
          Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
          The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
          within him, firing out of all his openings.
          Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
          heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
          Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
          lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
          pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
          skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.

          From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
          Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters
          all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With
          a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
          Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the

          Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears
          the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga
          grabs a sword.
          A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard,
          cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily.
          Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
          Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.

          He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --

          Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
          in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
          and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
          respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
          Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
          hand.
          The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
          Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
          back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
          powerful.
          Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
          towards the Bifrost.

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          If you care so much for the Jotuns,
          then die with them.
          The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
          drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
          concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
          towards the Bifrost.
          MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
          The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
          blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
          brother.

<b>          158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158
</b>
          Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
          land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
          to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          Thor! Help me!
          Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
          up at him desperately.

<b>          LOKI (CONT'D)
</b>          Please...
          Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
          brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
          then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
          around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
          Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
          him across the bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.
          Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
          him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
          It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
          to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
          Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
          never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
          Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

<b>                         LOKIS
</b>          I was always more clever than you.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Yet still not clever enough.
          With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
          summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
          channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
          Lokis.
          All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
          Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
          knocked from his grasp.
          Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
          back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
          away.
          Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
          confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
          his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
          pinned to the ground.
          Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
          towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
          do.
          Loki watches him smugly.

<b>                         LOKI
</b>          Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
          With all your strength, what good
          does it do you now?
          Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
          happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
          VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
          feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
          He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
          Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
          hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
          Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
          thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
          channels the power of the storm into it, then --
          He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
          massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
          the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
          where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

<b>          LOKI (CONT'D)
</b>          Stop! What are you doing?!
          Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
          The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
          out from it. Loki thinks fast.

<b>          LOKI (CONT'D)
</b>          If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
          never see her again!
          Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
          through the back.

<b>                         THOR
</b>          Forgive me.
          Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
          Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
          sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
          KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
          out of it.
          Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
          the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
          Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
          The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
          As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
          Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
          towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
          from the broken Bridge.
          They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
          force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
          by the debris, when --

<b>          A POWERFUL HAND
</b>          Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
          as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

          Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
          Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
          approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
          disappointment and regret.
          Loki lets go.

<b>          THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          No!
          But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
          falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
          him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
          Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
          Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
          into his father's arms.

          Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
          Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the

          Hogun points to Volstagg.

          The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
          look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
          smile.

          They laugh and raise another round.
          Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
          sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
          Frigga, bows her head.
