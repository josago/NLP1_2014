</b><b>                       THE THREE MUSKETEERS
</b>
<b>    OPEN ON:
</b><b>1   EXT. GASCONY - DAWN                                        1
</b>
    Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-
    tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox
    darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out
    of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.

    SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625.
    Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points
    cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The
    first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every
    facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance
    and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this
    moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous
    cry.

    They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.
    Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is
    nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the
    air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-
    saults. This is fun.
    Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden
    fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they
    fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of
    hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.
    Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.
    D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard
    up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly
    cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,
    fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...
    and follows.


<b>2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2
</b>
    Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard
    and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause
    to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other
    side, attacking, defending, as they go.

</b>
    Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances
    up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.
    She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open
    window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        2.
</b>
<b>4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4
</b>    Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-
    closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies
    after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild
    progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --
    stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his
    sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan
    parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over
    the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and
    rises to fight again.
    The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-
    volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly
    endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the
    last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-
    moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs
    toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan
    with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes
    when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap
    to join him.
    And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of
    music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-
    ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just
    then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard
    backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he
    stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He
    prepares one last blow --
    -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the
    side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical
    antidote to all this glorious swordplay.


<b>5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5
</b>    Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of
    reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with
    grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation
    will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and
    lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's
    apple.

    A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,
    long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.

<b>                            D'ARTAGNAN
</b>              Had enough?
<b>                            GIRARD
</b>                     (breathless
                      deadpan)
              I believe now would be a good
              time to end your, uhm, formal
              training. Well done.

</b><b>                               D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                 Thank you, sir.

    D'Artagnan leaps to his feet, races off without another
    word. Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his
    clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked.

<b>                               GIRARD
</b>                 And god have mercy on whomever
                 you meet next.

    steps with love. Sadness too.

    D'Artagnan steps through the country manor, calls out:
<b>                              D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                 Mother...?

    But he does not see her.    D'Artagnan continues, chatter-
    ing proudly as he goes.

<b>                               D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                 Did you see us? You heard us,
                 I'll bet. Girard finally
                 surrendered a compliment...
                 though I almost had to kill him
                 to get it... Mother...?
    D'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond.
    He pauses, then steps inside.

</b>    A piece of parchment, on it the words: "All For One, and
    One For All." And, in a place of honor, a worn blue and
    gold tunic. Below it, the Handsome Woman, d'Artagnan's
    mother, kneels at an open chest. She turns back to him.
<b>                              MOTHER (HANDSOME WOMAN)
</b>                 Sit down.

<b>                               D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                 Didn't you hear me? Girard --

<b>                              MOTHER
</b>                 Sit.
    D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair. A beat.
    His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open
    chest.
<b>                               MOTHER
</b>                 Your father was a proud man. And
                 he had a right to be. I never
                 knew one as brave or as kind. He
                 knew that his strength was a gift
                 to be given in the service of
                 honor. That is why he dedicated
                 his life to his country and his
                 King. That is why he gave his
                 life, for both.

    She reaches into the chest, carefully extracts a
    beautiful saber.
<b>                               MOTHER
</b>                 I watched you this morning and
                 saw someone I knew. You have
                 your father's heart, his will to
                 fight, his courage. But these
                 gifts have no value unless they
                 are given.
    She rises, holds the sword out to him.

<b>                               MOTHER
</b>                 It's time for you find your
                 fortune with men as brave and
                 as bold as you are. In Paris.

</b>                  And now to me.

     D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the
     nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno-
     cence. His mother smiles as she repeats.

<b>                                 MOTHER
</b>                  Yes, son.   And now to you.
     With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.         D'Artagnan
     takes it firmly into his hands.

     Mother and son stand in the vast expanse. D'Artagnan

     A bittersweet moment. D'Artagnan posed before his first
     great adventure. But not completely certain that he
     wishes to leave home.
<b>                                D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                  Mother. Maybe I should wait.
                  Until after harvest.
     D'Artganan's mother smiles, understands.       And speaks
     gently to urge him forward.

<b>                                MOTHER
</b>                  You've heard that every man in
                  the Musketeers is on the run from
                  someone or something?
<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                  Yes.   But what am I running from?

                  A shrew of a mother, and a drafty
                  old house. Now go.

     And in this fashion, she releases him. D'Artagnan sweeps
     his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps
     into the saddle. The horse reacts with a start, skitters
     in a half-cicle. D'Artagnan struggles to gain control,
     finally brings the horse to rein. He manages a charmed
     grin. His mother smiles, scolds:
<b>                                MOTHER
</b>                  And for heaven's sake, practice

</b>                  Horsemanship.    Got it.
     D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots
     off across bright green fields. His Mother shields her
     eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and
     watches him ride into the distance.

     the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME. It slides beneath the
     emblem, pries it off the wall. The emblem falls to the
     floor with an undignified thud. A fire blazes in a huge
     hearth behind it.

</b>               What should I do with this?

     Jussac offers   the emblem to a tall, elegant wraith in
     black finery,   a patch covers one eye. This is the COUNT
     DE ROCHEFORT,   Richelieu's right hand, one of the deadli-
     est swordsmen   in all of France.

               Throw it on the fire.
     Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze, it is
     instantly consumed. Rochefort watches it burn, then
     walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard.

</b>     Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove
     their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that
     already contains their swords and muskets. The
     Musketeers remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal
     the depth of their despair. The latter is supervised by
     the Cardinal's Guards, who view their hated enemies'
     plight with satisfaction. This is a sad day for the
     Musketeers, the end of an era.

     MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE forces a salute toward the captain
     of the Cardinal's Guards, hands over his own musket.

</b>     Treville is the respected leader of the Musketeers.       This
     is the saddest moment of all.

     Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his
     lips. He steps to the railing, addresses the men below.

     A hundred faces turn   upward to regard him. And on each
     the same expression   -- absolute loathing for the man in
     black. Rochefort is    not intimidated by this sea of con-
     tempt. He revels in    it.

                  than capable of assuming that...
                  responsibility.

     Muttered curses and dissent throughout.       Rochefort raises
     his voice to be heard:

<b>                                ROCHEFORT
</b>                  You are hereby ordered to

                         (with pleasure
                          and disdain)
                  'All for one, and one for all.'

     As Rochefort intended, the Musketeers explode. But
     before they can attack the Guards, de Treville's com-
     manding voice calls out above the clamor.

     And with that, the Musketeers freeze. Their eyes go to
     de Treville. There is a moment of silence as de Treville
     chooses his words carefully. Even in defeat, de Treville
     is stoic.

<b>                                DE TREVILLE
</b>                  Go to your homes. Wait. Our
                  day will come again.

     De Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles
     in a patronizing manner. Then, de Treville leads his
     Musketeers out of the courtyard.

     Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes to a
     mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak-
     ish angle. That's when he catches a glimpse of something
     behind him. Something red. Rochefort turns.
     a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the
     room, a spectre in red.

     ARMAND DU PLEISS THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU steps out of the
     darkness and into the light, his long crimson robes
     swirling about him like clouds of blood. His face is
     long, shrewd and intelligent. His eyes are penetrat-
     ing. He smiles his crocodile smile.
     Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls.
     It contains the names of all the Musketeers, past and
     present.

<b>16   EXT. BOULEVARD OF CRIME - DAY                                   16
</b>     Jussac leads   a regiment of the Cardinal's Gruards down
     Paris' most   colorful and notorious street. They react
     to SHOUTING   and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern
     ahead. The    one called... The Dead Rat.
     The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's
     Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody.
     Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open,
     and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his
     feet, threatening to drop him into the street. The
     Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women,
     song -- is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts:
<b>                                JUSSAC
</b>                  Release that man!!
     Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges
     to the street with a dull thud. Then, with a wink and a
     piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside. Jussac darkens,
     signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.


<b>17   INT. TAVERN                                                     17
</b>
     Jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in
     a shambles, the aftermath of a violent fight. But for
     now, all is calm.

     A group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big
     table littered with flagons and bottles. On the floor
     around them are their swords and rifles. It appears the
     Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's
     something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection,
     we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under-
     clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are
     all bruised and bloody. Some are unconscious.

     Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers.
     They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their
     boots up.

</b>     One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand-
     kerchief. He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of
     the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of
     great personal charm and style.
     His companion is   ATHOS, the Musketeers' deadliest and
     most charismatic   member -- also its most mysterious and
     tortured. Athos    is the unofficial leader of the Three
     Musketeers, their   planner and strategist. At the moment,
     he's sewing up a   nasty gash on his right arm.

                  our guests?

     Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously.    He is the
     epitome of politeness.

                  invitation. It would be

     Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward.

</b>                  And what do you say, Porthos?

     To the Guards' surprise, Porthos is balancing on the
     balcony rail above, just about even with a large wagon
     wheel chandelier.

<b>                                PORTHOS
</b>                  I'll be right down!
     With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the
     balcony and lands atop the chandelier. His weight causes
     the chains suspending it to break. With a whoop of
     pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands
     squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.

     When the dust clears, only Jussac has been spared. He
     looks on in disbelief as Porthos extricates himself from
     the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off.

<b>18   EXT. HIGH ROAD TO PARIS - DAY                                  18
</b>     D'Artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook-
     ing the magnificent city on the Seine. What he beholds
     is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven-
     teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the
     sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a
     magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.
     D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING
     HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and
     what he sees is this:
     Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth
     pursued by two men on horseback.

     His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women
     GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly
     formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby
     tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.

</b>     As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into
     space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the
     saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense-
     less. One down.
     D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re-
     verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan.
     The rider draws his saber.
     D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches
     the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the
     saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at
     d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is
     upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the
     second rider is senseless. Two down.

     D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath,
     but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as
     the two women ride back to see what's happened.
     The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark-
     haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her
     companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and
     equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE.
     Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan.
     She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off.
     Constance remains. She smiles down at d'Artagnan from
     atop her horse.

     Anne.

     D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling
     foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two
     bodyguards groan and grumble.

     A bright reflection catches d'Artagnan's eye. He looks
     down and sees a gleaming bracelet. He picks it up and...

     With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides

<b>23   INT. MUSKETEER HEADQUARTERS - DAY                            23
</b>     Athos, Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted
     courtyard. Silence -- the last thing they expected --
     stops them in their tracks. The place is a cemetery,
     haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers.
     Porthos is visibly distraught. Rochefort enters from
     behind an archway.

<b>                             ROCHEFORT
</b>               I'll take those tunics,

<b>                              PORTHOS
</b>               Tunics?   Coming right up.
     Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled
     red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He
     drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out
     another. He finds another in his boot and another up his
     sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he
     keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places.

     Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves.
     They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile.

<b>                             ATHOS
</b>               I was trying to remember the last

                  what I do. Sooner or later

     Athos cuts him off with a look. He's familiar with
     Porthos' propensity for tall tales. But not here, not
     now. Athos turns back to the balcony. Rochefort lobs a
     taunt.

     Athos, who has remained silent, speaks with quiet power:

</b>                  Do that, Rochefort. Tell his

     D'Artagnan rides through the streets of Paris. A country
     boy happily stunned by the sights, sounds, and smells of
     the city. Merchants gossip and call to each other from
     shop doors. Colorful vendors and pedestrians move along
     the crowded boulevard. Acrobats, puppeteers, and jug-
     glers perform on street corners. LAUGHTER and MUSIC
     drift from taverns and public houses.

     D'Artagnan views it all with great enthusiasm. He sees
     the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters... wow! The
     future belongs to him.

     amiably to a pretty woman on the other side. She dabs a
     tear from her eye, manages a nod.

</b>     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan races around another corner, down a
     narrow lane, and speeds after the ladies on horseback.
     He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water
     all over Porthos where he stands. D'Artagnan doesn't
     notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled
     INTO VIEW, blocking the lane. Fellow travelers shout
     complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an
     obscene gesture. It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam.

     D'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis-
     tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. A man
     waits in the shadows to escort them. D'Artagnan leaps
     off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot.
     But he takes two quick steps, and... runs directly into
     Porthos' outstretched hand.

     and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly
     soiled.

     BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third
     Musketeer, the dashing Aramis. Aramis has a book open
     and is reading from it.
     The Damsel suddenly grabs Aramis and kisses him on the

                  experienced in a passionate, all-
                  embracing way. We should feel

     knees.

     That's when the door bursts open and the lady's husband,
     an irate MARQUIS enters with a pistol. His eyes blaze
     with madness. He aims the pistol at Aramis' head.

     Aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window.

     As the Marquis aims and FIRES, Aramis puts one foot on
     the ledge and leaps into space. The shot misses him by
     inches.

     Anne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room,
     a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy
     a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac-
     ular map of the world. The map contains every known
     country and continent, including the New World. The
     SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom.
     Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And
     for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely
     a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings
     and queens who came before her. And a long way from
     home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She
     reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a
     pang of separation. We hear:

     His manner is both charming and paternal. Anne, smart
     enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings,
     is nonetheless touched by his concern.

<b>                                 ANNE

     Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.

     Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues:
<b>                                RICHELIEU
</b>                  Austria's loss is France's gain.

<b>                                ANNE
</b>                  Mostly, he is absent. I've barely
                  seen His Majesty since our wedding,
                  and that was three months ago.
                  Whenever he's around me, he has
                  nothing to say.

<b>                                RICHELIEU
</b>                  May I advise you?

     He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.        Anne
     nods assent.

<b>                                RICHELIEU
</b>                  Louis was only nine years old
                  when his father was assassinated.
                  He lost his childhood forever that
                  day. I have watched him grow
                  toward manhood, seen the toll his
                  life demands. A boy who is not
                  allowed to be a boy sometimes has
                  difficulty becoming a man. He is
                  shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet
                  stubborn. But most of all, he is
                  not yet sure exactly who he is.
                  The boy who lost his father. Or
                  the King of France.
<b>                                ANNE
</b>                  But how can I...?

<b>                                RICHELIEU
</b>                  Flatter him. Make the boy feel
                  like a King. So that the King
                  may be your husband.

     Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply...
     when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull
     boom, the Seneschal chants:

<b>                                SENESCHAL
</b>                  His Majesty, the King.

     The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is
     surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face
     is handsome and intelligent.

<b>                                  RICHELIEU
</b>                  Your Majesty.
<b>                                LOUIS
</b>                  Cardinal Richelieu, I've been
                  looking for you.

     As Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow.

</b>                  Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know
                  you were here.

     Louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love,
     behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's
     confidences, replies:

<b>                                ANNE
</b>                  Would you like me to go?
     Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here.       Determin-
     ation breeds a more capable attitude.

<b>                                LOUIS

                          that she is watching

     rebuke with quiet grace. Anne watches the latter closely,
     suppresses a smile. The boy is nearer to King than
     Richelieu imagined.

     carriage stops before it. She steps to the street,
     Parker follows. After a brief spoken exchange, the body-
     guard departs on some errand. HENRI, the driver, a brutal-
     looking fellow, incongruous in his elegant coachman's
     uniform, snaps the reins, and guides the carriage away.
     Milady steps inside.

</b>     REVEALS this to have been the POV of two men standing in
     the shadows across the street. COUNT DE WINTER, forty-
     five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE
     WINTER, twenty-five, his son. They are well-dressed. But
     their manner and appearance suggests that they have
     traveled a long distance to find her.
<b>                               COUNT DE WINTER
</b>                  Wait here.

<b>                               COUNT DE WINTER
</b>                  Wait.
     He will not consider otherwise. Armand sighs, stands in
     the shadows, and watches his father cross toward Milady's
     house.

</b>     Milady stands before a mirror, reaches for one of the many
     ivory combs that adorn her hair. As she places the comb
     we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm. She
     pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of
     Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark
     and cold. Milady does not move from the reflecting glass,
     she smiles.

               will you do?
<b>                             COUNT DE WINTER
</b>               Bring you back. To pay for what

               I will kill you with my bare
               hands.

     The Count steps closer, close enough to touch. Milady,
     eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about
     her lips, replies:

     sign of his father. He looks about, impatient... and
     steps across the street to enter.

</b>               Father?

     Worry makes him hurry. Armand takes hasty steps into
     Milady's bedroom. The first thing he sees is his own
     face in the mirror. The second is his father's inert
     body below it. Armand gasps, races to his side. A thin
     trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's
     ear. Armand gathers his father up into his arms, and
     begins to weep.

</b>     The monastery is a windowless building   bordered by a
     barren field, a dueling ground for men   who have little
     time to waste.  Athos sits on a stone   bench, waits for
     his adversary to arrive. His horse is    hobbled nearby.
     D'Artagnan rides INTO VIEW, dismounts.

</b>               I'll try my best to be on time.

     Athos appreciates the young man's retort, takes a closer
     look. Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm
     makes him wince.

<b>                             ATHOS
</b>               I asked two of my friends to act
               as seconds, but they are not as
               punctual.

     D'Artagnan notices Athos' pained expression, the blood on
     his sleeve.

     Porthos and Aramis arrive on horseback. They dismount,
     view d'Artagnan with amazement. D'Artagnan reacts with

</b>     Athos gestures for Aramis and Porthos to stand aside. He
     draws his saber, ready to fight. A beat. And in that
     moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never
     felt before in his young life. Fear. Athos sees it,
     allows him a moment to withdraw his saber. D'Artagnan
     does so, they square off, touch sabers, and...

</b>     Suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal combat. Athos
     takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT,
     and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.
     D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself
     face to face with Jussac.
     The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-
     ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords-
     man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire
     also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional
     elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful
     technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic
     ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than
     paint and canvas.
     And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all,
     Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of
     bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo,
     nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill
     of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his
     already impressive size and strength, and you have a one-
     man wrecking crew of epic proportions.
     D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He
     bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver-
     sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-
     rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself
     against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all
     directions at once.

     Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next.
<b>                             ARAMIS
</b>               They are nearer to God...

<b>                             PORTHOS
</b>               They're about to get a little
               nearer to the hilt of my sword.
<b>                               ARAMIS
</b>               Pagan.
<b>                               PORTHOS
</b>               Papist.
     Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents.
     He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat
     struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees
     him, sighs.
<b>                             PORTHOS
</b>                      (to Aramis)
               Excuse me?
<b>                             ARAMIS
</b>               I'm fine, thank you.

     And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile,
     Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers,
     wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls
     to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him,
     indicates d'Artagnan:
<b>                             ARAMIS
</b>               Take a look at our young friend.

<b>                             ATHOS
</b>               You mean he's still alive?

     Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out
     of Jussac.  Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge
     at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's
     sword like a snake and runs him through.

     Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full
     attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable
     them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases
     Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered
     the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos
     -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish
     bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head.
     Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him.
     The color drains from his face.

<b>                                 BISCARAT
</b>                  Now what...?

     Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about
     the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops
     to the ground without a sound.
<b>                                PORTHOS

</b>     A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan.
     D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending
     over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his
     breath.

     Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a
     pouch under his cloak. D'Artagnan sees the other weapons
     there, including a boomerang. Maybe next time.

     It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for
     the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever
     the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers
     mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier
     tone.

</b>     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     follow. HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers
     grow small in the distance. Then, sadly, he steps to his
     horse, climbs into the saddle. It has been both the best
     and the worst day of his young life.

     That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the
     corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by
     Rochefort himself. They see their wounded comrades,
     Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the
     distance.

</b>                         (pointing)
                  There they go! After them!

     But before Rochefort and the Guards can give chase,
     d'Artagnan rides into the middle of the field to
     challenge them, as if to further prove himself worthy
     of the blue and gold.
<b>                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  Long live the Musketeers.
     And d'Artagnan draws his saber.


<b>     AT DISTANCE
</b>     The three Muskeeters rein their horses, look back to
     d'Artagnan's bold charge.
<b>                                PORTHOS
</b>                         (with admiration)
                  Do you believe this kid.

     D'Artagnan gallops toward the Guards to engage them.    He
     races through PISTOL SHOTS like a demon possessed.
     Rochefort rides to the lead, draws his sword.

<b>                                ROCHEFORT

                          others)
                  Fall back! I'll take him myself!

     And like two jousting knights, d'Artagnan and   Rochefort
     meet in the middle of the field. Their BLADES    connect
     with a resounding CLASH, d'Artagnan is knocked   clear of
     his saddle. He hits the ground with a painful    thud.
     Rochefort's Guards leap towards him.

     exchange sad looks and hopeful comments.

     sword. The last thing d'Artagnan sees is the three

     A chamber in hell. Spiders the size of rats, rats the
     size of small dogs. A foul stench in the air. D'Artagnan
     is sprawled in a corner, unconscious, on a filthy matted
     floor. The sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest.
     D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action.
     As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux.
     He slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches
     for his own. But it is gone.

     sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes,
     feels the sharp tip of the blade.

                  I will give you your father's
                  sword.
     A long beat. D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged
     in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to
     come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts
     downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers.

</b>                  Give me my father's sword, and
                  I'll cut out your heart.
     Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt
     of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps
     from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.
<b>                                 ROCHEFORT
</b>                  Fool.   Like your father.
     Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled
     jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles
     on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan,
     inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags
     him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open,
     the jailer reacts with surprise, and...

     door behind him. A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the
     jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He
     looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the
     OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows.

     He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con-
     verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell
     doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands
     reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat.
     He shudders, leaps free. And continues.

     D'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated,
     no way out. Just      then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward
     him. D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked
     figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of
     sullen jailers.
     D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.

     ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is
     escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and
     toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as
     the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear-
     some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France.

     D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside.
     The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to
     join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal
     and the cloaked figure now behind it.

     The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu
     smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner,
     ignored for the moment.

</b>               I have an errand that requires
               your singular talents.

     The figure rises. The hood falls back... revealing the
     unforgettable features of Milady de Winter. She answers
     the Cardinal's smile with a seductive expression.

     from the same pit.

     unlocked. He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear
     close...

     When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a
     mighty kick. D'Artagnan scrambles into the correct
     posture of supplication. Rochefort continues:

     looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal
     speaks, his manner casual, friendly.

     Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly
     by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This
     time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he
     turns to the Captain, commands:
<b>                                RICHELIEU
</b>                  Find the three Musketeers and kill

<b>                                RICHELIEU
</b>                  A comforting thought. Good night,
                  d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning
                  comes quickly.

     With that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark.       HOLD
     ON d'Artagnan for a beat. History's pawn.

     BELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution
     scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner
     mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a
     PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad
     black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises
     his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his
     finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his
     bloody thumb.

</b>     The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's
     victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.

     D'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him,
     in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins
     a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers
     and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head
     high. If he must die, he will die with dignity.

     Richelieu appears beside him.

                  the Musketeers.
     Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man-
     at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is
     taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and
     several men-at-arms carrying muskets.

     The Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance
     from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered
     off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains,
     seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand
     grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.

     D'Artagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the
     stairs to the execution platform. The executioner and
     the Priest wait patiently above. D'Artagnan sees the
     bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie; pales.
     The Priest mutters comfort:

     neath the brim of his broad black hat. He holds a
     large Bible in his hands.

     The Priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks.         It
     is Aramis. He whispers:

     D'Artagnan's heart soars. He turns to face the execu-

</b>                  Prepare the prisoner.
     Porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'Artagnan in a
     threatening manner. He takes him by the scruff of the
     neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block. The
     crowd goes wild.

     ride on horseback, they wear familiar cloaks. A CLOSER
     look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through
     the city, towards the countryside beyond. But their
     progress has led them here. Anne frowns at the spectacle.

     She replies   with contempt, reins her horse away from the

     freezes in   place, eyes wide. As d'Artagnan, upon the
     cart, rolls   INTO VIEW.

     For just a moment, their eyes lock. Inestimable space
     between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches
     d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises
     his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a
     silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from
     the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source
     of this mayhem.

     scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women
     scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves,
     the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's
     seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP
     in the other... is Athos.
     Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the
     closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out
     a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the
     Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket
     to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of
     nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man-
     at-arms off the scaffold.

     leap after. Their hurried steps impede the Guards' pro-
     gress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. But several of
     the Guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the

     Gold coins on the carpet at their feet, food and drink
     between them.

<b>                                ATHOS

                  ride.

<b>                                D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                  But the Guards.

     D'Artagnan points to the bottom of the hill.       The mounted
     Guards chase after, begin their ascent.
<b>                                 ATHOS
</b>                  Do as I say.
     D'Artagnan hurries to the horses. Porthos and Aramis
     climb from the cab. Porthos emits a contented belch.
<b>                                ATHOS

                  Your pistol and powder, please.
     Aramis hands Athos a sack of powder, and his pistol.
     Athos tosses the sack into the carriage, takes aim with
     the PISTOL, and SHOOTS it -- igniting the powder inside.

     flames.

     long beat. Rochefort and a company of Guards    stand near-

     by something approaching camaraderie. Aramis smiles as

     The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall.
     D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.

                  that he died in the service of

     An uncomfortable silence.     It is Athos who finally speaks:
<b>                                ATHOS
</b>                  D'Artagnan, your father and another
                  Musketeer were ambushed and
                  murdered outside the Louvre.
     D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent.      He manages a

     D'Artagnan isn't listening. He stands suddenly, turns,
     and walks away. He doesn't want the Musketeers to see
     the tears forming in his eyes. Aramis shouts after:

     Fog drifts across    a lonely stretch of road. Suddenly:
     pounding HOOFBEATS    come over the scene. MUSIC SWELLS.
     And galloping out    of the fog come d'Artagnan and the
     three Musketeers,    riding hell-for-leather. HOLD ON this
     heroic tableau for    a long beat.

<b>80   EXT. BRIDGE ON ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                         80
</b>
     Four rough-looking MERCENARIES crouch on a low bridge
     spanning a shallow stream. They are armed with muskets
     and swords. The Mercenaries wait in the darkness, whisper
     eagerly among themselves.

     And the sound of HOOFBEATS is heard in the distance.
     Faint, but growing closer.

                  heads for identification.

     The Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. Right on
     cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist. But
     just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen
     break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to
     the right. Before the Mercenaries realize what's
     happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing
     through the shallow stream. In a flash, they return to
     the road, and race away. Having avoided the bridge
     completely.
     Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about, FIRE at
     d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into
     the night. Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.

</b>     An overturned wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter
     the roadway. The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on
     one of the kegs, holding his head. D'Artagnan and the
     Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a stop.

     Suddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing
     muskets. The ragged Farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls
     out a pistol, makes a smirking request:

                  you.
     D'Artagnan and the "Farmers" gape at Aramis in surprise.

                  If you don't haul those kegs away,
                  you're dead where you stand.
     The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol
     and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the
     trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of
     Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
     When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the
     three dead "Farmers" sprawled in the road and the three
     pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the
     Musketeers.

     Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform
     last rites over the bodies. D'Artagnan still can't be-
     lieve what just happened. He turns to Porthos. Porthos
     raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.

</b>                  There's only one rule, d'Artagnan

     velers and THREE BARMAIDS. They turn as the door flies
     open and the Musketeers and d'Artagnan enter from a RAGING
     STORM. They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear
     the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces.

     The occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with
     suspicion. Outisde, the STORM BLOWS. D'Artagnan closes
     the heavy door. Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to
     meet the four ominous travelers.

                  here today. They helped

     Porthos is on the lookout for danger. He reaches inside
     his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally
     exposes his Musketeer tunic.

     The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and
     d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. They stand
     back to back in a circle, ready for attack.

     But there is no attack. Quite the contrary.       The people
     here are thrilled to see them.

     The Musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and

     ry it to the fire.

     Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself.
     He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly
     voice.

     And with that, the three Barmaids desert Porthos and
     scurry across the room to attach themselves to Aramis.
     Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.

<b>                             PORTHOS
</b>               I said, 'A Queen is no different
               than a barmaid in the dark. Though
               less... practiced in the arts of
               pleasure...'

     The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee.
     But d'Artagnan isn't so sure. Porthos, with two Barmaids,
     bellows a reply.

<b>                             PORTHOS
</b>               If you're going to be a proper
               Musketeer, you'll have to learn
               the manly art of wenching. Right,
               ladies?
     The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over
     Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-
     ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
<b>                             PORTHOS

     Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings
     her lips toward his.
<b>                             PORTHOS

               lasting impression is made. If it
               is weak, she will think you are
               weak. And if it is comical, she
               will think you are a clown. With

               clown, your  first kiss must be all
               the things  that you are. Like
               this...
     Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it,
     turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.

     The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. Her face
     covered with tears. Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by
     the outcome. He turns to d'Artagnan, cites:

<b>                                 ARAMIS

     D'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the

                  got all night.

     D'Artagnan steps forward. The dark-haired Barmaid sees
     him coming and smiles. D'Artagnan stands before her,
     hesitates, not sure where to start. Then, remembering as
     best he can:
<b>                                D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                  'Shall I compare thee to a summer's

                  Ahh, to hell with it --

     D'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a

     D'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at

     of Burgundy.

     A Barmaid scurries INTO   VIEW. Porthos grabs her by the
     waist, adds the Barmaid   to the one already sitting on his
     lap. The chair breaks    beneath them, and all three go
     sprawling on the floor,   laughing heartily.

     He remains lost in drink. D'Artagnan appears beside him.
     He hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude.
<b>                                  D'ARTAGNAN

     Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.     He fills
     his flagon for him.

     The word nearly makes Athos grimace. He stares at
     d'Artagnan for a long beat, then beyond. As if to look
     into another time and place. Finally:

<b>                               ATHOS

                  Would you like to hear a story,
                  d'Artagnan? A love story?
     Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain
     he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He
     nearly whispers:

<b>                               D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                  Yes.
     Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy,
     wipes the blood red wine from his lips.
<b>                                ATHOS
</b>                  I once knew a man... one of the
                  Counts of Berry. My native
                  province. When the good Count was
                  about your age, he fell in love
                  with a visitor from Paris. A
                  breathtaking girl of seventeen.
                  She was more than beautiful,
                  d'Artagnan. She was...
                  intoxicating. And this man, the
                  poor idiot, he married her.
<b>                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  The Count took her to his castle
                  and made her the first lady of the
                  province. They were happy for a
                  time, as happy as a man and a
                  woman can be. Then one day, while
                  riding in the woods, the girl was
                  thrown from her horse, and knocked
                  unconscious. The Count hurried to
                  help her. Her dress was torn.

                  of clothing she refused to remove.
                  The Count's curiosity got the best
                  of him. He reached over and slid
                  down the gold band. He saw

</b>                  The Count's angel turned out to be
                  a murderess who escaped the
                  Executioner's blade. She swore
                  that she loved him. Swore that
                  she had changed. And if he would
                  just keep her secret, they would
                  live a long life together.
     Athos pauses, imagines that life.      The Count and his
     angel.
<b>                                ATHOS
</b>                  But the Count was young and he was
                  stupid. He was tormented by the
                  ridicule of his social class. And
                  so he rejected her. For her lies
                  and for her past.

                  crime.

     HOLD ON Athos for a long time.       As he gathers up his pain,
     and puts it back again.
     Athos SMASHES open another BOTTLE. But the story has
     made d'Artagnan quite sober and a little sick to his
     stomach. He refuses another drink.
<b>                                 ATHOS

                  blood in it! I feel like dancing!
     Aramis launches into something appropriate. Porthos and
     a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance.
     Porthos is damned good. His joie de vivre is infectious
     and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging
     him. Every once in awhile, another WEAPON -- a dagger or
     something -- drops out of Porthos' clothing and hits the
     floor with a CLATTER.

     That's when Porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of
     control, trips and falls on Athos' table, crushing it to
     the floor.

     Porthos lies in the wreckage, staring up. Athos, totally
     unperturbed, looks down and offers him the bottle.

     D'Artagnan is terribly hung-over from the night's
     carousing. He looks like he could puke at any moment.
     So that's exactly why Porthos shouts to him and says...

                  A connon ball.

     Athos is cut off by an EAR-PIERCING WHISTLE as a CANNON
     BALL drops out of the sky and STRIKES the ground nearby,
     sending up a tremendous EXPLOSION.
<b>                                PORTHOS
</b>                  I hate cannon balls.

     Another BALL EXPLODES into the ground in front of them.
     Their horses rear up in fear, threatening to dump them
     out of their saddles. As the Musketeers and d'Artagnan
     struggle to control their horses, they look back and see
     an old castle atop a distant hill.
     A group of men operate two rusted cannons, left over from
     some long-forgotten war.
     The Musketeers barely calm their horses, when another
     BALL comes SCREAMING their way, IMPACTING a few feet
     away. As dirt rains upon them:

</b>                  I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal
                  had chopped if off.

</b>                  Stay with us, and you just might
                  get your wish.
     Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and
     the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle-
     ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six
     horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He
     changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after.

     and Aramis in the other. The pursuing horsemen soon
     race INTO VIEW, break in half to give chase.

     screens, we discover Anne reclining in a large tiled bath,
     Constance attending. Constance replenishes the bath with
     pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron.
     In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends:

     Richelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No
     doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He
     takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness.

     Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching
     below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to
     another matter of business.

</b>                  There are so many to choose from.

                  see if I remember it correctly.

     Porthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their
     shoulders. They crest the top of a bluff, rein their
     horses to a stop. They can afford to rest for a moment.
     Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them.

                  relaxing boat ride.
     At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the
     bank of a swift, choppy river.

</b>
     The ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about
     fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the
     other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the
     trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes.

     As Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re-
     turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather-
     beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across
     -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country
     WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip,
     the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely
     jostling the Woman and her child to the rear.
     The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and
     scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss
     to his way.

<b>                                FERRYMAN
</b>                  A privilege to carry you on my

     The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child.

</b>                  Two pistoles.

</b>                  But I only have one. Couldn't

</b>     All turn to regard Aramis on horseback, Porthos at his
     side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise. The
     Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and
     protests.

                  Musketeers.
     Two two Cavaliers react to the word. The Ferryman does,
     too -- into cringing, obedient servant.
<b>                                FERRYMAN
</b>                  Musketeers? Well, why didn't you

     he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the
     hill on their horses.

</b>                  We sail!

     And with that, Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom-
     erang and brings it down on the dock rope. The rope
     splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock.

     ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them
     for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what
     Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them
     with keen interest.

     The middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the
     best place for a duel. But the combatants make the most
     of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with
     everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent
     swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the
     Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must
     keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.

     devilish grin, chases him between -- and at one point,
     over -- blindfolded horses.
     Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re-
     ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the
     child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of
     the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a
     neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with
     one arm while continuing to do battle with the other.
     He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.

     The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the
     flatboat deck. Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle,
     breathless. Porthos complains:

     approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and
     muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's
     Guards.

     Porthos grumbles    after, follows suit. They leap atop
     their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they
     guide them to the    edge.

     Stalemate. Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos
     grin. Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest. They
     count...

     And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look

</b>     A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER. Porthos clinging to
     his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on his
     fellow Musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead.
     Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge
     boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... Aramis and Porthos
     finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. They
     lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land...
     and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of
     Cardinal's Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their
     arrival.
     Porthos looks down at his latest sash -- destroyed like
     the others. Aramis draws his saber, mutters.

      Cool, clear water. WIDEN to reveal d'Artagnan and Athos
      at a shallow pond, watering their horses. The forest
      around them is dark and primeval.

<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                   Do you think we've lost them?
<b>                                 ATHOS
</b>                   They'll catch up eventually.

      To the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at
      their beautiful surroundings, remembers:
<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                   My father used to hunt in a forest
                   like this. He promised to take me
                   on my tenth birthday. I don't know
                   why he picked that year. Something
                   about a boy becoming a man. I'd
                   lay in bed at night and imagine it,
                   just the two of us. But he died
                   before I could go with him.
      Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with
      quiet cynicism:
<b>                                 ATHOS
</b>                   Well. You have your boyhood wish
                   at last. The dark forest. The
                   thrill of the hunt. The nearness
                   of death.
      Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.

<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                   I'd be proud to die for my King.
<b>                                 ATHOS
</b>                   I just wanted to save you from the
                   life of a Musketeer. You don't
                   have to go looking for experience,
                   d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon
                   enough. And when it does -- it
                   will mark you forever.

      Athos rides into the forest.    D'Artagnan hurries to
      follow.

      shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. A
      pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING
      HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see
      SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.


<b>102   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             102
</b>      Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest.
      The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes
      d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.
      Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at
      the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all
      around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-
      gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the
      crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with
      Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a
      SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others
      curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ
      back and forth like angry hornets.
      Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.
      The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to
      tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:
<b>                              ATHOS
</b>                I'll hold them off for as long as
                I can. Go on without me.
<b>                              D'ARTAGNAN

                this.

<b>                              ATHOS
</b>                Ride to Calais and stop the
                Cardinal's agent.

<b>                              D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                Athos... I can't.

      Athos points his pistol at d'Artagnan.
<b>                              ATHOS
</b>                Go, or I'll kill you myself.

      A few days ago, d'Artagnan would have obeyed without
      question. Fearful, if nothing else. But not here, not
      now.

                   Agreed?

      D'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He
      produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and
      hand. And looks between.

      missing a beat.

</b>                   Tails.    I stay.

      Athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving
      d'Artagnan a chance to see.
<b>                                  D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                   But...?
      Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the
      kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express
      it. And that there is no use arguing with him.

<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                   At least take my pistol.

      There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.       He knows Athos
      hasn't got a chance.

      A lonely stretch of road, illuminated by moonlight. A
      signpost announces: CALAI 15 LEAGUES. An exhausted
      HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the
      saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes
      open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from
      his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He
      opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then
      closes them.
      We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING.
      The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt
      just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we
      can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback,
      bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de
      Winter.

      Pistols are cocked.    Henri's shadow falls across

<b>                                 HENRI

      D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped

      He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the
      grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table.

      D'Artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters.
      Beyond: the harbor lights of the Port of Calais.

      Somewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.        Milady
      smiles.
<b>                                 MILADY
</b>                   Quite sure.
      D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.        Milady rises from the bed.
      She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and
      silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly. En-
      joying his discomfort, Milady       crosses the room, joins
      him at the window.

      She manages to combine sympathy, seduction, and just a
      hint of danger. All in a single reply. D'Artagnan
      hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then:

      Milady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. As

      pear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'Artagnan's
      heart stop.

      Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the
      King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning
      d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and
      slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary

      D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front
      of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is
      empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains
      his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady
      speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:

      Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She
      looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to
      continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All
      conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks

      Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the
      look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him.

      Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists
      slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.

      Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along     the line of
      his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at      the top, enough
      for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they     press against
      the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her      finger traces.

</b>                   I'm sorry --
      D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down
      toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a
      dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in
      the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking
      the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-
      stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger,
      stunned with fear and surprise:

</b>                   You came to Calais to stop a spy
                   from sailing to England.

      D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the
      messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to
      the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her
      negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,
      reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of
      the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess.
      Just as Athos told it to him.      Not so long ago.

                   Parker!!
      The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo-
      Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with
      a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And
      steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his
      right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-
      fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps
      forward to meet him.

      Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A
      series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.
      The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the
      martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,
      dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions.
      Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair,
      and commands:

      D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to
      suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping.
      Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes
      her mind.

      Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is
      followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by
      Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife
      against d'Artagnan's side.

      Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches
      the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws
      back with surprise.

</b>      The innkeeper, roused   from sleep, and wearing a night-
      shirt, is engaged in   urgent conversation with Armand de
      Winter -- the son of   the man Milady killed in Paris. The
      innkeeper shakes his   head. Armand grabs him by the
      collar.

      D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience,
      and just a hint of fear. Milady commands:

</b>                   The back stairs. Hurry!

      catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below.

                I once knew a man, one of the
                Counts of Berry. He told me a
                story... of beauty and danger.
                He was the bravest man I've ever

      The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But
      she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has
      reminded her of the one thing in the world that still
      touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady
      gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage
      window.

      bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier,
      ready for any encounter.
      D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.    There is a mel-

      D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join
      the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the
      Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords
      spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out
      of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on
      the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop
      d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted
      on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!
<b>                                 ATHOS
</b>                   Sorry I'm late. Did I miss
                   anything?
      D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.       He leaps to his
      feet and embraces Athos.
<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                   I thought you were dead.

</b>                   Keep your mind on the mission,
                   d'Artagnan.

      He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray. D'Artagnan
      follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards
      in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection.
      Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the
      absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --
      and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his
      opponents.

      Milady views the latter with alarm. As the battle rages
      around her, she retreats into the shadows.

      side. Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual
      frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown.
<b>                                 ATHOS

                   weakness. Second, take advantage

      One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks
      Athos. Athos kicks the false leg out from under him,
      knocks him to the deck. D'Artagnan repeats, even as he
      disables his own foe.

      Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last
      rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him
      where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,
      rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the
      ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis
      resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.

      Milady whips her horse, drives it onward. But Athos
      overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms.
      They fall to the ground with a crash. Milady grabs the
      deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle.
      Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his
      side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half-
      light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.

      Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest.
      But Athos stands and shouts:

      Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him.
      Athos holds his musket in a steady hand. A very long

      past and what it brings.

      Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull
      the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes
      his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly,
      before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past,
      their love, and where it led them.

</b>      A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On
      the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined
      against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds,
      surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the
      cliff.
      Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift,
      her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years
      younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks
      behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis,
      d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step.

      The procession stops at the cliff's edge.
      THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The
      Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The
      Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his
      cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze.

      He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her
      image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until
      the day he dies.
      Aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred
      priestly cloth he carries.

      Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau
      silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The
      Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck,
      exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the
      scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it
      down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:

      locks eyes with him. Athos' desperate act, the pure
      feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release.

      uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the

      D'Artagnan sadly lowers his head. Porthos puts a

      Athos and the others press on. D'Artagnan, a little
      disappointed to be left behind, pauses, checks the
      buildings that loom overhead. Then he starts, reacts
      with shock and surprise.

      trails the royal couple. He nods to Rochefort in
      passing. They exchange significant smiles. Anne spots
      the smirk on Rochefort's face. He resumes a supplicant
      pose. Anne glances back, Richelieu behind them.

      what they are seeing. Three men against a hundred. It's

      to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.

      Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible
      happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some
      from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof-
      tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as
      monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold
      tunics.
      The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The
      corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and
      Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos
      keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are
      charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and
      face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in
      the sunlight.

      edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below.
      They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching
      d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him. And at
      the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of
      three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound-
      ing kick.

      The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor,
      and plunges to his death.
      D'Artagnan peers down the shaft. There's a faint CRASH
      as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes
      like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides
      down into the abyss.

      the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced
      the palace is under seige. Constance pauses amid the
      riot, seeks the Queen.

      But Richelieu has found her first. He steps to Anne,
      assumes an air of priestly innocence.

      blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into
      further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward,
      press their bodies against the door to secure it.
      BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half.
      Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic.
      His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis
      and Anne across the room.

</b>                       (a cold whisper)
                Kill him. Kill her, too.

      Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath. He
      advances on Louis and Anne. Louis has witnessed the
      latter, treason confirmed. He raises his own sword,
      prepared to protect his Queen. To die for her if
      necessary.

      Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King. But
      one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on
      the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other
      side. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead.

      Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack.
      But the young King has no intention of being protected.
      He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his
      Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions.
      Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her
      gaze, then returns to battle.
      Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard
      slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a
      heavy goblet, shouts:
<b>                                   CONSTANCE

      Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne
      catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the
      hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.

      Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him
      from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through.
      The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks,
      and continue.
      Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty
      confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand.
      Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's
      two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he
      staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the
      floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the
      treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off
      the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and
      Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded,
      Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.

      But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts.
      Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort
      grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But
      Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the
      face with his fist.

      D'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He
      tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it
      neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows
      this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.
      But he shouts:

      They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their
      faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan
      has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.
      Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He
      cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a
      knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the
      floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But
      d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his
      feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.

      Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.
      He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with
      superior disdain:

                   Musketeer.
      But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. "Always find
      your enemy's weakness." He shoves a thumb into
      Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward.
      D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's

      Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks
      at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death
      finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a
      SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling
      at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his
      doublet.

      paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives
      after to retrieve   it.

</b>      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan
      stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,
      clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d'Artagnan's look
      of triumph...

</b>      A short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers
      have won. On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu
      who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers.
      Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands.

      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby.

<b>                                 RICHELIEU
</b>                   Your Majesty, that document is an
                   obvious forgery. I am clearly the
                   victim of a conspiracy designed
                   and perpetuated by these three
                   Musketeers.

      Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to
      both King and Queen.
<b>                                 LOUIS
</b>                   This is a complicated matter,
                   Your Eminence, affecting both
                   France and the crown...
      A beat. As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude
      blame after all. But Louis continues with quiet author-
      ity, just a trace of humor. As King, and as a man.
<b>                                 LOUIS
</b>                   And so, until such time as I and
                   my advisors --
                          (gestures toward

                   await our decision in the comfort
                   of... the Bastille.

      Musketeers close in around the Cardinal.     He fumes,
      protests.

      A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led
      from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan.
<b>                                 RICHELIEU
</b>                   Congratulations, Monsieur

                   Thank you, Your Eminence.    I'll
                   be watching you, too.
      Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by
      guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind
      his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him.
      Louis turns to the Musketeers.       He indicates d'Artagnan.

<b>                                 LOUIS
</b>                   Is this the young man who saved
                   my life?
      Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.
<b>                                 PORTHOS
</b>                   His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.

<b>                                 LOUIS
</b>                   Approach, d'Artagnan.

      D'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and
      Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And
      turns to the Queen.

<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                   I have something that belongs to
                   ... Your Majesty...
      D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country
      road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the
      Queen smiles.

                          (off his look)
                   It belongs to her.

      Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW.
      D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time.
      The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance,
      charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around
      her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis
      continues:
<b>                                 LOUIS
</b>                   D'Artagnan, I am in your debt.

                   you've shown me? Anything,
                   D'Artagnan.  Whatever your heart
                   desires...
      D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied,
      unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him.
<b>                                 ATHOS
</b>                   Majesty, his heart has only one
                   desire. To become a Musketeer.
      D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession.
      Louis answers with pleasure.
<b>                                 LOUIS
</b>                   Then kneel, d'Artagnan.
      D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of
      his sword on each of his shoulders.
<b>                                 LOUIS
</b>                   The world is an uncertain realm,
                   filled with danger. Truth

                   Honor undermined by the pursuit
                   of gold. Freedom sacrificed when
                   the weak are oppressed by the
                   strong. But there are those who
                   oppose these powerful forces.

                   possible, but necessary to our
                   continued survival. As a country,
                   as a King. These men are known as

</b>      As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless
      images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony,
      Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first
      encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their
      adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a
      busy week.

<b>                                 LOUIS

                   Musketeer.

      D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS
      RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears
      gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround
      their young friend, and happily present him with the
      bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic
      over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan
      hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts
      more valuable than gold.
      Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.       Who, to the surprise
      of all who know him... smiles.

                   such a contortion, twisted and
                   stretched... into a smile.

<b>                                 ARAMIS
</b>                   It was spectacular. And what
                   teeth.

      D'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.
<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN
</b>                   I know this is a stupid question.
                   But what exactly does a Musketeer
                   do?

      Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance.       They're not so
      sure themselves.
<b>                                 PORTHOS
