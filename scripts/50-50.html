          It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches,
          golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of
          rapturous citizens.

          A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers.
                         
          We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered,
          pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old
          man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches

          Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one
          would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked
          away behind the sterile and monochrome walls.
                         
          Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is
          engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores
          Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do.
                         
          Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The
          Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.

          The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not
          knowing what to do. He coughs again.
                         
          Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.

          The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine.
                         
          Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and
          browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time,
          Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he
          hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out:

          Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else
          there. Again the receptionist calls out again -

</b>           Follow me.
                         
          The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and
          hands him a hospital gown.

           clothes?
                         
          The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.

</b>           I'll figure it out.
                         
          The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips
          on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the
          front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides
          he has it right.
                         
          Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find
          JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse.

          Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to
          irritate his skin.

          It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to
          lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard
          is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then
          rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.
                         
          About a mile inland, we come upon:

          Southern California Suburbia.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and
          louder as we PUSH IN ON:

          The interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the
          walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his
          Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School
          Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic
          Achievement Award in the Sciences.
                         
          Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to
          RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and
          artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud
          obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up.
          Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks
          around in confusion.

          After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and
          turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns
          back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the
          sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm
          returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but
          now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes
          a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain
          storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound
          of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -

          Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only
          makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds
          simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she
          puts a pillow over her head.

          Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an
          end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the
          bed, collects himself.

          Adam and GREG (45), Adam's slightly moronic co-worker, place
          the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an
          elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family
          of four Cro Magnons. Outside their hut it's snowing, but
          inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on
          the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN
          teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the
          fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The
          dinosaur looks poised to pounce. Adam notices.

</b>           I'm going to put you on a 4 month
           regimen of chemotherapy. It's an
           aggressive dosage so you might want
           to think about taking some time off
           from work.
                         
          This is real. Adam walks to the window and presses his face
          against the glass. He looks down at the city below. From 15
          stories up, the people on the street look like miniature
          figurines.
                         
          Adam turns back to Dr. Ross.
                         
<b>                          ADAM
</b>           Can't you just cut it out of me?
                         
<b>           DR. ROSS
</b>           Yes, that is an option. But because
           the tumor has spread to a such
           significant size. Cutting it out
           now would be risky.
                         
<b>                          ADAM
</b>           Well what are my chances of beating
           this?
                         
          Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are
          seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but.
                         
           DR. Ross
           Listen, you're in good hands. The
           best thing for you to do right now
           is to not worry...Let me do the
           worrying. Alright?
                         
          Dr. Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face.
                         
<b>           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
</b>           Maybe you should talk to someone.
                         
          Dr. Ross hands Adam a business card for the "Mount Sinai
          Psychology Group".
                         
<b>           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
</b>           We have a whole department of
           psychologists here in the hospital.
           They specialize in cases...in
           these...sort of matters. They'll be
           able to help you.
                         
          Not knowing what else to say, Dr. Ross looks at his watch,
          looks back to Adam, and moves to the door.

          Like a ballerina, Rachel crosses to Adam on her tip toes
          holding out a spoon of her goulash. She holds up the offering
          to Adam's mouth. He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to
          hide his internal distress. His sad eyes tell Rachel another
          story.

          on her shoulder. She gently strokes his hair. Adam's hand
          slowly moves down Rachel's back. He starts kissing her neck.
          He knows it's wrong, but can't help it, the only thing
          running through his mind is sex.

          as far as she can and pulls out a cookie jar. She sticks her
          hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of American
          Spirits. Adam looks at Rachel disapprovingly.

          Rachel puts one of the cigarettes to her mouth, lights it on
          the stove and takes a drag.

          Rachel begins compulsively pulling drags from the cigarette.
          Adam takes the cigarette out of her hand. He goes to put it
          out, but takes a drag instead. He then hugs Rachel with one
          hand and opens the window with the other; he proceeds to
          discreetly fan out the cigarette smoke.

           characterized by the abnormal
           growth of cells. These cells form a

           you'll see our newest exhibit "The
           Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD
           by the catastrophic eruption of Mt.
           Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden
           and forgotten until 1748 when
           archeologists began to excavate the
           site. Here we see exquisitely

           probably looked like.
                         
          Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's
          final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the
          air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women,
          and children run through the streets in horror. People are
          sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild
          orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model
          devours a villager.
                         
<b>                          ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>           According to Pliny the Younger -
           "You could hear women lamenting,
           children crying, men shouting.
           There were some so afraid of death
           that they prayed for death. Many
           raised their hands to the gods, and
           even more believed that there were
           no gods any longer, and that this
           was one unending night for the
           world."

           a stopping ground for the deceased.
           We understand that life is
           different for everyone, and helping
           families to see their loved ones
           off to the hereafter means
           approaching every funeral and
           burial with it's own dignity and
           care...A funeral is a representation
           of the individuals time spent on
           earth, so I ask you to reflect on
           your inevitable interment and think
           carefully in choosing the service
           and tomb that best befits you.

          Dr. Lamb picks up a handle that's attached to the morphine
          drip and sticks it in Adam's hand.

</b>           I want you to push this little
           button any time you feel pain.
           It'll trigger the morphine. You
           think you can do that?
                         
          Adam moves his hands really slowly in the air -

          Art and Edith enter the room. Adam reacts like a little kid
          being picked up from pre-school.

          Suddenly the most excruciating pain runs through Adam's body
          causing him to scream in agony.

          A door bell. A hand reaches out. A finger on that hand pushes
          the door bell. The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers.
                         
          The hand belongs to Mitch's wife, MARGARET (80). She stands
          on the porch of a small beach bungalow.
                         
          The front door opens. Margaret looks straight ahead. Nothing.
          She then looks down, startled by Adam in a wheelchair.

          Edith, Art, Katie and Seth.
                         
          Seth and Katie are playing a video game: DUCK HUNT. Edith

          Everyone makes their way to the table. Visibly weak, Adam
          slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair. He yelps in pain.

          Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a
          small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the
