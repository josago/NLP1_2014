<b>          EXT. FARM - DAY
</b>                         
          It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house,
          several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit
          between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated
          valley.
                         
          TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an
          overgrown paddock.
                         
          THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden.
                         
          TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line.
                         
          TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car.
                         
          FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling
          front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The
          others knit a large blanket.
                         
          TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.
                         
          A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading.
                         
          A MAN chops wood.
                         
          A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.

          A large room with unfinished wood walls has several
          blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor.
                         
          TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food.
                         
          MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but
          appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered
          face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.

          The men sit around a table eating dinner.
                         
          One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK.
          Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is
          WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy
          beard.

          The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The
          men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk
          outside.
                         
          The women file into the dining room, clear the men's
          dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a
          new serving of food.

          The women sit around the table eating very small portions
          of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table.

          The kitchen is filled with dishes.
                         
          TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken
          crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the
          crib.
                         
          People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly,
          a figure passes quickly through frame.

          Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up
          the driveway. She carries a small bag.
                         
          Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to
          see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window
          watching.
                         
          Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the
          woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins
          to run.

          Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently
          yells out: "MARCY MAY"
                         
          The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.
          For a moment everything is quiet.

          Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into
          the woods, chasing after Martha.

</b>                         
          The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She
          hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man
          and two women are chasing her.
                         
          Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps
          running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.
                         
          Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see
          the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and
          begin their descent.
                         
          Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her
          pass by.

</b>                         
          Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits.
          She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms
          from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.

          Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled
          cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food
          like she hasn't eaten in days.

          The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and
          cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They
          are seated. Martha returns to eating.

          across from her.
                         
          Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats
          them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.

          The waitress drops the check on the table.
                         
          Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching
          into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He
          sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs
          the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her
          hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.
                         
<b>                          WATTS (CONT'D)

          He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the
          table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces
          eye contact with her.
                         
          Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances
          around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to
          make a scene in front of all these people.
                         
          He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't
          kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until
          she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips.
                         
          Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is
          turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly

</b>           You know that death is the most beautiful

           because everyone fears death. And fear is
           the greatest human emotion of all because
           it creates complete awareness. When
           you're scared it forces you to be
           completely aware of your surroundings and
           the moment you're in. It brings you to
           NOW and that makes you truly present. And
           when you are truly present, that's
           nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is
           pure love.

          Lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs.

          Lucy freezes, she tries to stay calm but bursts into
          tears. There is a long, tense silence. Lucy dries her
          eyes.

          Martha shakes her head.

          packed and sitting by the front door.

          Martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices
          footprints.

          Martha stands on the dock. She strips down to her
          underwear and dives in.

          Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water
          and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the
          surface. A few seconds pass by and she is not coming up.
                         
          Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for
          air.
                         
          She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice
          homes that appear to be empty now. No one else is
          swimming.
                         
          Martha sees a scruffy MAN sitting on a neighboring dock,
          he seems familiar. He is in his mid twenties, his jeans
          are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. His shirt
          is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. He
          looks directly at Martha. They make eye contact.
                         
          He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water,
          puts on his shirt and just sits there.
                         
          Martha swims back to the house.

          Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car. Ted
          drives and Lucy sits up front. They drive up the driveway
          and turn out onto the road. Ted and Lucy talk. Martha 
          gets a concerned look on her face. Ted slams on the 
          breaks.

          The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit
          him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into
          the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car
          drives behind Ted's car.
                         
          Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back
          again to see that he is still there.

          She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying
          something but then stops herself. Instead she sits in
          silence.
