     NYFD Lt. GORDY PITT strains as he works the handle of an
     old-time, hand-cranked ice cream maker. It's a tough job
     requiring strength, patience and determination. In a
     nutshell, that's Gordy.

     Firefighter JUNIOR MONTINE, black Panamanian descent,
     watches Gordy crank away.

                 It's the twenty-first century.   We
                 got electricity now.

     Gordy keeps cranking.

    Gordy stops.    Pops the lid.   Spoons out a dollop.

    He sticks the spoon in Junior's mouth.      Junior eats.
    Junior loves it. Gordy smiles.

    The FIRE BELL SOUNDS.

    Everyone scrambles. The choreography's practiced,
    automatic. It's achieved without conversation.

    The channel surfer slides down the fire pole.     He's
    followed by the man who was upstairs snoring.

    Junior rips a sheet from the teleprinter. He hands the
    printout to the snorer, the company's "chauffeur."

    Feet jam into boots. Yellow trousers are hauled up and
    hitched with suspenders.

    Yellow jackets are whipped on.

    The chauffeur TURNS OVER the PUMPER'S huge MOTOR.

    Firefighters take their stations on the truck. Headsets
    go on. As the fire company's lieutenant, Gordy rides
    shotgun. The chauffeur hands him the printout. As the
    engine moves out under lights and SIREN, Gordy speaks to
    the men over the headsets --

    FLAMES ROAR from the upper stories of this slumlord's
    shitbox. An engine and ladder company are on-scene
    attacking the fire with hoses. Neighbors gawk. Gordy's
    engine company arrives. Gordy hits the ground, moves to
    a battalion chief. The chief's terse orders are drowned
    out by the NOISE of the EQUIPMENT, fire and men. Gordy
    moves back to his company, who have already hooked the
    engine up to water.

<b>                            GORDY
</b>              Top story's fully involved. We're
              supporting inside. Two lines up
              the stairs.

    He points to Junior and then to the channel surfer, MIKE
    SHEA, a veteran firefighter of Irish descent.

<b>                            GORDY

    He points to the chess player, SAL DIBIASE, another FD
    veteran, Mediterranean descent, and then to the rookie,
    RONNIE BOOK, a New York melting pot mutt.

<b>                            GORDY

    The chauffeur, ART WESTPHAL, German-Irish, stays with the
    engine as Gordy grabs a fire axe and leads his two two-
    man hose teams into...

    Gordy and his men charge the stairs dragging the heavy
    hoses. Rats head past in the opposite direction,
    deserting the burning building.

</b>
    They meet fire on the third floor. On goes the water.
    Gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants,
    using the axe to open locked doors, then taps Junior and
    Mike, indicates "up." Begins leading the hose team up
    the stairwell. Sees something and yells a warning --

<b>                            GORDY
</b>              Stairs're screwed. Hug the wall.

    They reach the fourth floor.    There's fire everywhere.
    And then...

     They see a FIREFIGHTER from the other company. He has
     fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway
     above. He's pinned under a large section of heavy
     debris, coughing and screaming for help as fire rages
     around him. To Junior and Mike --

<b>                                   GORDY
</b>                  Knock it back!

     They turn the hose on the flames as Gordy moves to the
     trapped firefighter. Gordy tries lifting the debris,
     can't budge it. He starts chopping at it with the axe.

     Chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again.

     Gordy hacks off a large piece of debris. He levers his
     axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter.
     Mike moves to help. Gordy heaves up on the axe. The
     debris lifts. He heaves harder. It lifts more,
     until...

     Mike slides the firefighter out. Gordy yanks his axe
     free. The debris collapses. Gordy moves to the
     firefighter.

     takes off. Charges the next flight of stairs. Reaches
     the fifth floor. Tries to reach six, but there's too
     much fire. He's beaten back... but not before he hears
     the FAINT sound of SCREAMING.

     Gordy looks down the fifth floor hallway to an apartment
     door at the end. Between him and the door is the gaping
     hole in the floor. It's too big to jump. He starts
     running. He's gonna jump it.

     Gordy reaches the edge of the hole. Leaps with all he's
     got. At the same time, he swings the axe, point-first.
     Slams it into a spot high on the wall, and...

     Gordy swings over the hole on the axe handle.

     He hits the other side running. Drives a shoulder into
     the door at the end of the hall.

     Gordy bursts in. It's an inferno. He looks up. Knocks
     his axe on the ceiling. Hears desperate POUNDING back.

     Gordy climbs a table. Starts whacking upward with the
     axe, attacking the peeling, crumbled plaster overhead.

     Gordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above, but
     he's not doing it fast enough. He won't beat the fire.

     Gordy calls down to his men.

     Beat.   Mike and Junior pass the hose up.

     Gordy aims the nozzle at the hole he started in the
     ceiling. Turns it on full jet.

     Gordy's barely able to hold the hose as the high-pressure
     stream bites into old, decayed plaster.

     Bit by bit the ceiling falls away.       Gordy's almost
     through to the room above, when...

     Falling debris severs the hose. Gordy's lost pressure.
     He hasn't broken through. The building's coming down.
     He's gotta get outta there.

     Gordy's not going anywhere. Picks up the axe.       Attacks
     the hole again furiously, until finally...

     breaks through! A small hole, which he quickly widens,
     to reveal... a terrified Latino family gaping down at
     him, their room ablaze around them. Gordy reaches up.
     Speaks to them in Spanglish --

     Gordy carries the family's small child outside. He

     Gordy holds Matt in his arms as water pours over them.
     It's the second child he's held in the last few hours.
     This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid:
     what a father wants for his child. We see the deep

     She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy
     sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds...

     Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against
     the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing --

     It appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the
     chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering
     as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League
     plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League.

     Gordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his
     lungs.

     The rivalry's intense. The game close.       The noise
     deafening. Bets are going down.

     NYFD goes up by one in the final minute.

     Gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team.

     LUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented
     fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an
     unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And
     misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts
     toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting,
     devastated at missing the easy "two." Gordy yells at him
     to defend.

     Luis shakes it off. Hustles back on "D" as his man gets
     the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And
     Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The
     BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins.

     Luis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence
     around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew
     match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the
     fence, clearly trying to intimidate him.

     Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off.

                  anymore.

     But Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the
     gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to
     go.

     Latin man, clearly Luis's father and the bodega's owner.
     We don't hear the words, but we can tell Gordy's
     complimenting the boy to his dad.

     Gordy emerges.    Checks his watch.   Whistles up a taxi.

     Gordy dodges pedestrians.     Still trying to get a glimpse
     of Anne and Matt.

     The cop we saw writing tickets earlier is walking the
     other way. Gordy nearly collides with him. At the last
     moment, the traffic cop shuffles Gordy aside.

     In b.g., behind Gordy, we see the cop get into a brown
     Ford.

     A FedEx TRUCK, WINDOWS SHATTERED, SKIDS past, wiping out

     There's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to
     avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air,
     tumbling, then smacks to the ground.

     Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris.
     Then struggles to his hands and knees.

<b>                             GORDY

     He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a
     large shard of glass embedded in his leg.

     People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about
     finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but
     can't see them, when...

     His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.

     Gordy's flanked by the armed policemen, one with a
     Rottweiler. As they walk, a PA announcement in Spanish
     is repeated in English...

                  Avianca flight 42 to Panama City
                  is now open for boarding.

     OFF Gordy, having heard the announcement --


<b>88   EXT. PAN AMERICAN HIGHWAY (PANAMA) - DAY                          88
</b>
     The highway terminates here, far short of Colombia. The
     idea is to inhibit the northbound migration of people and
     drugs. From this point south lies the Darien Gap, a
     thick rain forest traversed only by rough trail.

     A cab with a Panama City logo pulls up at road's end.
     Gordy gets out with the Panamanian CAB DRIVER. The Cab
     Driver indicates a Panamanian man waiting there with a
     .9mm on his hip.

     Gordy pulls out his wallet, pays the Cabbie.

<b>                                CAB DRIVER
</b>                  Gracias, senor.

     The Driver gets back inside the cab.    Out the window --

<b>                                CAB DRIVER
</b>                  Que la vaya bien.

     He drives off. Gordy looks to Ever. Ever smiles,
     motions him to follow, then turns south and starts
     walking. As Gordy falls in behind...


<b>89   EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                         89
</b>
     Gordy and Ever pass through pristine tropical rain
     forest.

</b>
     rushing fiercely through the jungle, Ever uses his
     machete to cut two lengths of bamboo. He hands one to
     Gordy and indicates how they'll ford the stream. Gordy
     nods, then follows Ever's lead into the perilous, belly-
     deep water. They struggle to maintain their balance,
     even with the sticks. When they reach the opposite bank,
     Ever signs okay to Gordy and smiles.


<b>91   HELICOPTER CARCASS                                            91

     They pass the carcass of a crashed and burned-out
     helicopter, when...

     Two dangerous-looking men armed with assault rifles step
     out of nowhere onto the path ahead of Gordy and Ever.
     Gordy and Ever stop. Gordy glances at Ever. Ever's
     focused on the men and clearly doesn't like what he sees.
     Gordy looks back. The armed men advance toward them
     carefully, rifles in the ready position. Gordy watches
     them approach, wondering who they are and what they're
     going to do. Ever, frightened, takes a half-step back,
     then swings the length of bamboo fast and hard, and...

      He smashes it into the base of Gordy's head, knocking
      Gordy out.

      The men run up. One man covers Gordy, while Ever and the
      other man rifle his pack and toss his pockets. They take
      his passport, wallet, and an NYFD T-shirt. And then
      they're gone.

      sits up. Feels the bloody lump on his head. It hurts,
      but it's not serious. He searches his pockets and
      backpack, realizes the passport and wallet are missing.

      Gordy stands. Looks around. He's alone.      He's in the
      jungle... He keeps heading south.


<b>93    EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                            93
</b>
      Gordy trudges on. The thick jungle's hot and humid,
      full of STRANGE SOUNDS and shadowy animal movements.

      Gordy's going uphill, when he rounds a bend in the trail,
      and...

      He meets a man coming the other way. Alarm gives way to
      the realization that the man is followed by a number of
      people, including women and children. As they pass
      Gordy, it's apparent they're refugees from their haunted
      expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions...

      Gordy addresses the passing people.     Indicates where he's
      standing.

<b>                                  GORDY
</b>                   Aqui?   Colombia?...

      No one replies. Then a small COLOMBIAN GIRL comes up and
      gets his attention. She runs back up the trail a short
      distance and stops. She draws a line in the dirt.

<b>                                  COLOMBIAN GIRL

</b>                  Panama... Colombia.

     She smiles. At the sound of a sharp WHISTLE, however,
     she runs back quickly, passing Gordy and rejoining her
     family. Her father hands her a machete and a Zippo
     lighter, says something to her. Whereupon the little
     girl returns to Gordy and holds the items out to him.
     Beat. Gordy takes them.

<b>                                GORDY
</b>                  Gracias.

     The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the
     refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back
     uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in
     the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he
     walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people
     to flee for their lives, and...

     Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement
     past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he
     now steps over the line and advances into Colombia.


<b>94   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS (COLOMBIA) - DAY/NIGHT         94

     Where the rain forest of Darien continues in Colombia.

     Darkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill.    At
     night, the JUNGLE'S EVEN NOISIER. When...

     EVERYTHING GOES QUIET. Gordy slows. And suddenly,
     AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere. Not close, but
     not far, either. A FEW BURSTS, some SINGLE SHOTS -- the
     call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE. And
     then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return.

     As Gordy walks on...

     The sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a

      Gordy has left the trail. He lowers his pants just
      enough to expose his injured thigh. A bandage covers the
      wound made by the glass shard. Gordy unwraps the
      bandage, revealing...

      A wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of
      Anne and Matt. A long, livid scar marks the wound.

      Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then
      removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and
      photo inside the bandage.

      One of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that
      ply Colombia's back-country roads.

      As the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road, Gordy
      sleeps. He's an object of some curiosity -- not only a
      gringo, but a virtual Gulliver in comparison to the
      small-statured Colombians pressed in around him.

      To the Man in the Yankees Cap as they walk --

      The man puts a finger to his lips, hushing Gordy.
      They've come abreast of the checkpoint, which can be seen
      in the distance through the trees. Colombian soldiers
      have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection.
      The chiva's DIESEL GROWLS loudly. When suddenly...

      We see figures moving in the forest between the group and
      the checkpoint. And then...

      The forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of AUTOMATIC
      WEAPONS FIRE being directed at the soldiers at the
      checkpoint. In the same instant, an RPG takes out a
      Colombian Army humvee in a bright, fiery EXPLOSION.

      The man pulls Gordy down as the group hits the dirt.   The

      The attack rages furiously for twenty seconds, then wanes
      to sporadic GUNFIRE. Other WEAPONS are FIRING now,
      too -- clearly the Army is finally mounting a defense.
      And then...

      We hear the sound of PEOPLE CRASHING through the forest.
      They're running toward Gordy and the group. The CRASHING
      GETS CLOSER. And now Gordy begins to hear the BREATHLESS
      PANTING of the guerrillas in retreat. BOOTS THUD past

      One of the running guerrillas trips over Gordy and goes
      sprawling. The guerrilla, wearing the motley uniform of
      an irregular soldier, whips a look back, and...

      Gordy finds himself staring into the battle-hardened eyes
      of a fierce young woman. In a heartbeat...

      The woman jumps back to her feet, and   joins her comrades
      laying down a suppressing FIRE at the   soldiers. Spent
      cartridges rain down around Gordy, as   the AK-47 ON FULL
      AUTO chops loudly over his head. And    then...

      The group is in the greatest danger now -- caught between
      the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers, who are giving
      chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them.
      Everyone in the group scrambles to his or her feet and
      begins to run. And...

      Soldiers do notice them and begin to FIRE.

      BULLETS SHRED the foliage around Gordy, whipping past his
      head... He and others keep running. A man goes down when
      a BULLET BITES into his leg. Gordy slows, but the Man in
      Yankees Cap won't let him stop to help. Slams him hard
      on his back. Keeps pushing Gordy forward. A few moments
      later, we hear M-16's on FULL AUTO back where they left
      the man.

      The powerful TORRENT ROARS through the forest.

      Gordy and the others reach the near bank, where the path
      drops into the water to reappear on the opposite bank.
      The Man in the Yankees Cap is in the lead. He plunges
      into the fast water up to his waist. Gordy and the rest
      splash in behind, struggling to cross against the swift
      current. The Man in the Yankees Cap reaches the far
      bank. Takes two steps, and...

      stop mid-stream, but one of the group, a young woman,
      believing the blast was caused by the pursuing military,
      continues struggling to cross. An OLDER MAN looks, sees
      the blast-hole.

<b>                                OLDER MAN
</b>                  Mina.

      Gordy realizes the old man's saying "land mine."   To the
      young woman --

<b>                                GORDY
</b>                  No!

      Gordy moves to catch her.   Just manages to stop her as
      she reaches the far bank.   Gordy points to where the land
      mine detonated.

<b>                                GORDY
</b>                  Mina... Mina...

      Beat. Slowly, the terrified young woman responds to the
      strong, calm tone of command in Gordy's voice and the
      unpanicked, reassuring look on his face.

      Gordy brings her back to the group, which fights to stand
      in the rushing river. He indicates for them to hold
      hands for stability. Motions for them to stay.

      leaves the group in the middle of the river. The GUNFIRE
      is now FAR-OFF AND SPORADIC. He crosses to the water's
      edge on the far bank. Pulls the Zippo from his pack and
      leans over. Uses the flame to illuminate the mud and
      rock immediately in front of him. Scratches lightly at
      the ground with the machete, searching for mines. Finds nothing
      in that spot. And steps onto it.

      Searching the ground and scratching at it with the
      machete before each step, Gordy inches toward the Man in
      the Yankees Cap. Three steps from the river...

      He finds a small, round anti-personnel mine the size of a
      hockey puck. He inches past it. Moves past another.
      And another. To the writhing Man in the Yankees Cap --

<b>                                 GORDY

      Finally, Gordy reaches him. One of the man's legs is
      missing below the knee. He's bleeding from various other
      wounds as well. Gordy uses the Zippo to inspect the area
      for more mines. Then kneels in a footprint.

</b>                   You'll be okay... You'll be okay.

      He takes a bandanna from the man and ties a tourniquet
      around his thigh. By way of distracting him --

<b>                                 GORDY

      Beat.   Gordy finishes the tourniquet, when he sees...

      has left the group and emerged from the river in a
      different place to avoid the mines.

      Gordy's eyes go to something glistening in front of the
      young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground.
      The kid's about to hit it. Gordy shouts --

      stops... But not before he plants his next step, and...

      The trip wire bows against his shin, and...

      Gordy ducks, covers the Man in the Yankees Cap, and...

      Nothing happens. The young man just stands there, frozen
      in position, his leg still bowing the line.

      Using the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to
      the young man. He follows the trip wire to where a Coca-
      Cola can hangs from a nearby tree. On closer inspection,
      Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade.
      There's no pin in the grenade. The can keeps the
      grenade's arming spoon in place. The trip wire's
      designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to
      explode at chest level... And the can's almost off.

      Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire. Then
      carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade.

      Gordy finds the town, which lies along a river. He
      traces a road from the town. The road runs south through
      the town of Mompos, and eventually reaches Caguan, the
      ELC capital.

      Two plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry
      load and now relax their vigil. One man holds a Xerox of
      Gordy's passport photo. The other bites into an
      empanada, which breaks open and spills its contents down
      the front of his shirt. His partner finds it funny. He
      doesn't. And while their attention's occupied...

                   Everyone needs equipment fixed.

      Armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat. And now
      his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone --

      Beat. Gordy's contemplating the warning, when his eyes
      go to a small, sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped
      deck, leaning against his father. Gordy reaches over and
      taps the boy. The boy looks over. Shrinks away at the
      sight of the large gringo. The father notices and looks
      at Gordy, who stands, indicates his seat.

      Finally, the father accepts, sits down with the sleepy
      boy on his lap. Nods his thanks at Gordy, who then gazes
      down at the son. A kid about Matt's age. Armstrong
      recognizes the look of a caring dad.

      The ferry pulls up to the dock. The dock street is a
      culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders,
      of big-wheel SUVs and mule carts. There's a definite air

      Gordy follows Armstrong's look to two plain-clothes
      federales, one fat and one thin, standing near the dock
      watching the boat pull up.

      When Gordy glances back, Armstrong is gone.

      backing him up.

      He clamps a hand on Gordy's arm. Gordy shakes it off and
      starts running. Almost immediately, he's tackled to the
      ground by the thin federale. Two more federales join in.

      Gordy's not gonna go down easy, though.

      Even as only one against four, Gordy's a formidable
      challenge. He's strong, and he's committed all the way.
      He's not getting kicked out of this country again. It's
      not a clean or artful fight. There's no karate. It's
      four men trying to tackle a bull, and...

      lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice, beans

      In here, the MUSIC'S LOUD ROCK 'N' ROLL. Gringo music
      for a gringo bar. The place is busy, with plenty of
      local "hostesses" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing
      half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad
      women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one
      of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the
      other.

      Gordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the
      crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when...

      The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly,
      revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but
      now Gordy can see the "Deerborn" logo clearly.

      Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap.
      It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts
      toward the girl, when...

      Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The
      thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving
      in on him.

      Gordy moves faster toward the girl.   And...

      The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the
      cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab,
      and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics.

      The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy.

      Gordy's almost to the hat.

                   a spoon on.

      Gordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. Glances back, sees
      the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back,
      when...

      A strong hand stops him. The hand belongs to the Fat
      Federale. And now the thin federale's there, too,
      wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it. People in
      the bar fall silent. Everyone but Armstrong, who's
      finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose.

<b>                                 ARMSTRONG

      And now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and
      sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat

      Armstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy, but...

      Instead of hitting Gordy, Armstrong accidentally-on-
      purpose clocks the fat detective. Then hisses into
      Gordy's ear, clearly not that drunk --

      But then Armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale
      jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts
      surprise the Armstrong neural network.

      Gordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when...

      The Fat Federale ZAPS him with another STUN GUN, just
      behind the ear... And Gordy gets to know the floor, too.

      They're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant.

      Gordy and Armstrong are led in by the federales. The Fat
      Federale has Armstrong's hat. He looks it over,
      wondering why Gordy wanted it. Then decides he could
      give a fuck and tosses it to Armstrong. Clangs the cell
      door shut and locks it. Leaves shaking his head.

      guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged
      infiltrators. The federales are armed with batons and
      stun guns, taking no chances. It's clear the rebels

      are cut and bruised. The tougher-looking of the two has
      taken a real beating. This beaten man is jammed face-
      first against the bars of Gordy's cell. He makes eye
      contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and
      put into a cell. Then the beaten man is shoved into the

      As dawn breaks over the river, FIND Gordy sitting in a
      motored panga being steered by a local BOATMAN. Gordy

      The panga rounds a bend, and...

      Two souped-up bass boats filled with heavily-armed ELC
      guerrillas move to intercept it.

      The Boatman slows, puts the panga in neutral and keeps
      his hands in sight.

      One boat of guerrillas pulls alongside. The other sheers
      off and stops a short distance away, ready to open fire.

      Gordy shows the guerrillas his travel pass. One of them
      takes it. Reads. Looks Gordy over. Then starts to rip
      the pass in half, when...

      He stops. Grins. It's a big joke. He hands back the
      pass, searches the boat quickly and waves the panga on.

                   Supervisor for Caguan.

      It's a prospect that seems to concern Felix almost as
      much as Gordy. Off which, as they get into the Toyota...


<b>177   INT. ELC SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE - DAY                              177
</b>
      The ELC SUPERVISOR for Caguan may be a Marxist, but the
      clean, well-ordered office is nicely appointed, with a
      big-screen Sony and leather furniture. The TV's TUNED TO
      CNN. A photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man
      wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an ELC patch and
      holding an AK-47. A brass nameplate reading "Supervisor"
      rests on a neat desk, behind which stands the man himself
      -- a hardened, former guerrilla fighter proud of his
      position. He's not in cammies now -- his uniform now
      consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat
      Rolex.

      Felix is a subordinate here. He and Gordy stand across
      the desk as the Supervisor examines Gordy's travel pass.
      Gordy's nervous about what could appear on the TV in the
      b.g., but tries not to show it.

                   got drunk and fooled around with a
                   police officer's wife.

      The Supervisor just looks at him, assessing Gordy's face
      for signs he's lying. Gordy's expression stays the same.

      Felix respectfully interjects.     It's almost a plea.

      A long beat. The ELC Supervisor hands the travel pass
      back to Gordy. In a hard tone to Felix --

      Gordy and Felix pull away from the Supervisor's H.Q.
      Felix resumes his former tone of command.

      Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive,
      looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf,
      searching the face of every man. He doesn't see The
      Wolf, but what he does see surprises him. The ELC
      Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos. It's a third-
      world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot
      of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here
      the streets are calm and orderly. It's quiet, almost
      eerie, as people go about their business. OFF Gordy,
      seeing another side of the guerrillas...

      Felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the
      plantation. The entrance is guarded by a 4X4 "Rat

      They've had a lot more than two beers. Felix has,
      anyway. He's drunk. He's also in love with a waitress
      on his lap, a cute gordita named BERTA. He pats her.

      Gordy takes a swig of beer.      When...

      Gordy sees the Beaten Man from the jail in Mompos.       The
      man has just walked in with another guerrilla.

      Gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross
      the room. At the bar, the bartender puts out two crates
      of beer. The guerrillas take the beer and head out. No

                   my bed...

      The Suburban pulls up next to a house.       There are armed
      guerrilla guards outside.

      Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the

      carrying the beer inside. And a moment later...

      Felix comes around with a start.

      Gordy drives back. They approach the Suburban and the
      house once more. This time it's on Felix' side. Felix
      gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and...

      Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the
      other way: a large propane tank next to the house.

      A man is injured, and his teammates call for one of
      Gordy's guards to substitute. The man in the combat vest
      responds. The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining
      the skins. Puts down his AK, strips off his combat vest
      and shirt, and runs in.

      Gordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades.
      With the other guard still watching him closely, however,
      there's nothing Gordy can do.

      The soccer game rages back and forth. Suddenly, an open
      man gets the ball. Breaks toward the goal.

      Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the
      goalie. He cheers the action loudly, whereupon...

      Gordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and...

      Gordy grabs a grenade.    Almost gets it into a tool box,
      when...

      The player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and...

      Gordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping
      into the tool box by picking up a large wrench... But the
      grenade's still visible as now...

      Felix comes around the corner. He's sleepy and hungover.
      And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress.

      Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the
      GENERATOR. It SPUTTERS, but won't catch. Felix just
      looks at him. Gordy makes an adjustment, and...

      This time,   the ENGINE TURNS OVER. PURRS like new. The
      heat lamps   brighten in a row of sheds. Felix winces as
      the DIESEL   ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head

      A replay of last night. Felix is pretty wasted.    Berta's
      in his lap again. In Spanish --

<b>                                 FELIX

      Someone whistles for a drink. Berta starts to stand.
      Gordy slips her twenty US dollars to stay. She does.

      Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box. He slides it
      just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked
      over the waistband. He finds some wire. Then searches
      for something else. Finds a piece of string and checks
      its length. From Gordy's reaction, we understand it's
      too short.

      Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets. Nothing. He
      checks the glove box. No long string there, either. But
      he does find two rubber bands. Gordy studies them a
      moment, thinking. Tests their elasticity. Then pulls
      out the Zippo and thumbs it. The lighter still works.

      As Gordy pockets everything and walks off...

      Gordy steals through town, hiding when he sees someone
      coming. He's re-tracing the route he took the night
      before, when he followed the Beaten Man's Suburban.

      He passes the "Cine" in the storefront. A movie's

      continues to make his way through Caguan, when...

      He rounds a corner, and there's a four-man ELC patrol,
      two in a truck and two out. Gordy turns, starts heading
      back, when...

      One of the GUERRILLAS calls to him.

<b>                              GUERRILLA

      Gordy stops. The two standing men walk toward him. The
      other two men get out of the truck to provide backup.

      One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands
      off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up. Gordy
      carefully produces the travel pass. The guerrilla looks
      it over. In butchered Spanish --

      The attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the
      children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy.    A
      guerrilla waves them on. The woman and boy hustle by,
      glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as
      they pass. They hurry on toward the nearby "Cine."

      OFF Gordy, as the guerrilla indicates for him to start
      walking to the truck...

      Felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights.
      The room's a mess. All kinds of rubbish. There's a

                will take you down river at seven.

      Felix closes the door. We hear a LOCK TURNING. Gordy
      moves to the door and tries it. It's definitely locked.
      Through a small window, he can see the lights in the
      sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime ELC sentries
      patrolling the grounds. The DIESELS ROAR in the b.g.

      Gordy turns back. Readjusts the grenade digging into his
      belly, then hooks it back inside his pants. He turns off
      the light. Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door.
      THROUGH another small window, he can see it's dark in
      this direction.

      Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room.
      We see some rubber tubing. We see some rope. Gordy
      finally finds a piece of sharp metal. He moves to the
      wall with the window. With the DIESELS covering the
      noise, Gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe.

      Gordy is making slow progress through the wall, when he
      hears the VEHICLE arrive. He moves to the window by the
      door and looks out. Sees the Suburban. Four guerrillas
      are getting out, including the Beaten Man. Felix meets
      them. The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix. Felix
      indicates Gordy's room. As the Beaten Man continues to
      question Felix...

      Gordy realizes he's fucked. He can't get through the
      wall fast enough. His eyes go to water dripping from a
      pipe leading to the washtub sink. He moves to it. Finds
      the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. Cranks
      shut the master valve on the pipe. Wraps his hands
      around the pipe and pulls. Nothing. Jams his feet
      against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... And
      this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. He
      finds the rubber hose. Fits an end over the pipe.

      Quickly lashes it on with some wire. Then cranks on the
      master valve. High-pressure water streams from the hose.

      Gordy sneaks a peek out the window. The Beaten Man's
      still questioning Felix. The sound of the hose water is
      being covered by the DIESELS.

      Gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole
      he's made in the wall. He aims the stream at the hole.
      Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even
      harder... And watches the jet begin eating away at the
      old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling
      plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement.

      WHAM-WHAM-WHAM, one of the DIESELS Gordy repaired suffers
      a spectacularly loud internal breakdown. The heat lights

      Gordy's hanging onto the chassis. With the large tires
      and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to
      get his legs over the rear axle. He's just finishing
      rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the
      rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other,
      to support Gordy's back. He hears the ENGINE START,
      grabs the transfer case, and...

      The rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly, inches from Gordy's
      face. And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy-
      duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of
      the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's
      legs. ROCKS are PINGING everywhere. The dirt and the
      dust are choking. Even for a short distance, it's going
      to be a long, dangerous ride.

      continues to suffer underneath. Even with the rope
      supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands.

      A vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. It starts to
      slip free. Gordy can't stop it without letting go. The
      grenade falls, and...

      Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. Barely. The spoon
      just hanging on the end of his fingertips. Gordy can't
      use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold
      onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to
      lose it. And just as it falls...

      Gordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger
      through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags
      the grenade before it drops to the road. And then...

      Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar
      the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and
      screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer
      case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach,
      where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back.
      Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to
      relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm.

      carefully lowers himself to the ground. Slides out on

      wheel. The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut
      trees. Gordy watches the guards. When the guards aren't
      looking, he runs to the nearest tree. The sounds of the

      roll away, and...

      The guard picks it up. Never sees Gordy in the shadow of
      the tree, pressed against the trunk. The guard shows the
      coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back.

      He's found The Wolf, when...

      Suddenly, a guard appears, and...

      Gordy freezes. Eases into the shadows. His dirty face
      and clothes blend in just enough. The guard moves past.

      When the coast is clear, Gordy moves to the large propane
      tank. He takes out the grenade. Puts the rubber bands
      around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand,
      holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then...

      Slowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing
      the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring-
      loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now,
      Gordy's going up in the blast.

      Gordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands
      stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're
      barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it.

      Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane
      tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and
      removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the
      cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his
      fingers. And...

      Lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands.    Gordy
      squeezes out as much as he can onto them.

      in the direction of the sound, and...

      Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching

      Gordy's eyes flash with alarm.   He glances at the house.

      A piece of paper has fallen from one of Gordy's pockets
      and fluttered to the ground nearby. The woman picks it
      up, and we see...

      It's the photo of Anne and Matt.

      The woman stares at the photo a moment, as...

      Gordy absorbs another blow.    He tries to stand.

      the photo in her hand. Glances up into her eyes again.
      They hold the look. A whole conversation exchanged
      without words. Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy, lying
      in a pile on the ground. Beat. To Gordy --

      Dark and dank. Excavated clay walls and floor. Heavy
      door. A bare overhead bulb provides some light.

      Gordy lies on a metal bed frame. One of his legs is
      chained to the bed. He's in pain from being kicked --
      but the physical aches are nothing compared to the
      anguish he feels for having failed.

      The door's unlocked and opens. Daylight streams in from
      above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards.
      He moves to the middle of the room. Looks at Gordy.

<b>                                 THE WOLF

      Gordy just looks at him.

      The Wolf signals a bodyguard, who crosses to Gordy and
      frees his leg from the chain.

<b>                                 THE WOLF
</b>                   You want to kill me? Come and
                   kill me.

      The bodyguards are smiling. Gordy hesitates, then
      springs for The Wolf, and...

      The Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking
      karate combination. The Wolf's no Jet Li -- his style's
      a throwback, even ugly, but it's well-practiced and
      brutally effective. Even still, Gordy springs back right
      away... and The Wolf drops him again.

      Gordy comes up swinging. Gordy's a barroom fighter. If
      he can touch you, you're in trouble. He never gets
      close. A vicious front kick folds him, and a fist drives
      him to the floor. The Wolf stands over him.

<b>                                 THE WOLF

                   soldiers, no matter how merciless
                   or corrupt they are.

      The last kick really hurt Gordy.    He's slow rising.

                   like yours will pay the price.

      The Wolf wants to pique him, but this is pouring gasoline
      onto fire. Gordy explodes off the ground. The
      suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard.
      Gordy drives him backward. Slams him against a wall.
      Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and
      drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen.
      All his weight behind the punches. Trying to break ribs
      and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when...

      A bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordy's kidneys.
      Gordy takes the blow standing. The guard delivers a
      second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in
      agony. Beat. The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to
      his midsection. And then...

      He makes Gordy pay for the punches. Lands blow after
      blow on Gordy's face. Beats the living shit out of
      him... and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor.

      the truth. She reaches into a skirt pocket, then extends
      her hand toward Gordy. He looks up. She's holding the

                   was a medical aid worker. We met
                   in Guatemala, in an Indian village
                   called Guamaunco. We were married
                   there. Sophia, our daughter was
                   born there. Claudio was kind and
                   loving, and we were happy... We
                   were there four years when the
                   civil war broke out... The
                   guerrillas were all around us, but
                   left us alone... Then they made an
                   attack on the army nearby. The
                   next night, soldiers came to our
                   village. They were led by
                   American 'advisors'... They
                   accused us of helping the rebels.
                   Our women were raped. Our men
                   were tortured. Our homes were
                   burned... We crawled out into the
                   fields, but they threw grenades,
                   and Sophia...

      She looks into Gordy's eyes. The look says she
      understands and shares Gordy's pain because she's
      suffered her own painful loss. She looks away again.

      Claudio opens the door of a cheap rental garage in an old
      commercial strip. He steps inside. There's a rental van
      and a big Ducati motorbike against a wall. Claudio
      straps a black bag onto the bike, then rolls it out and
      shuts the garage. Pulls on helmet and STARTS the BIKE.

       fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the

       running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin

       He's between Selena and the only way out.   And there's no
       way she's getting past him.

       But that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with
       the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of
       the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can.
       It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling
       garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the
       crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over,
       the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard.

       Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit.
       It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg.
       It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his
       feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head.

      Gordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all
      dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and
      then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy
      stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate.
      Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can
      across the slate pavers, and...

      The can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She
      falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to
      run, when...

      Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a
      brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm
      around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks
      backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing
      whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's
      not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have
      to kill him before he'd let go.

      Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around
      Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller
      woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till
      she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of
      the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do
      is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the
      courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped
      with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses
      in her ear --

<b>                                 GORDY
</b>                   You killed them.

                           contempt)
                   One woman, one boy -- they mean
                   nothing next to the thousands
                   who've been slain.

      Gordy hears it.    It only drives him to a deeper fury.

<b>                                 GORDY
</b>                   They were my family.

      Gordy's blind with rage. Chokes her neck hard.
      Summoning all the power in him, first to shut off her air
      and blood, and then to continue squeezing, relishing her
      every dying moment, until he's snuffed out the life of
      the person who took Anne and Matt from him. And...

      He can't... it's all he's wanted since he saw Anne and
      Matt die, but now he can't do it. He's a firefighter.
      He saves lives. If he kills Selena, Gordy crosses into
      her world, into Brandt's world, into the brutal nightmare
      destroying Colombia and all the places like it, and becomes
      part of that sadness and death... And...

      Gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe.
      Selena gasps for air. The impulse to murder has left
      Gordy. There's a new resolve...

      Under which an EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD emerges from the
      building. He sees Gordy and Selena -- a large man
      holding a smaller woman in a chokehold. Draws his gun.

<b>                                   EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD

      Gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun.
      Selena screams.

      He's going to shoot. Gordy has no choice.       As he lets
      Selena go and stands --

      It's too late. Selena stomps a heel into the Guard's
      knee, crushing it, then twists the gun from his hands.
      She points it at him and pulls the trigger, and...

      In his agitation, the guard never took the safety off.
      Selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety.

      The GUN FIRES, just as the crowbar hits Selena, spoiling
      her aim. The bullet creases the guard's arm. Selena
      recovers. And the next BULLET...

      Isn't hers. It's from Phipps' GUN. It takes Selena in
      the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way
      through her body. She's dead on her feet. Her body
      crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large
      pool that quickly spreads over the slate.

      move in to help the guard as Phipps holsters his pistol.
      He walks to Gordy. The two men share a long, silent
      look. It's over. Gordy looks again at Selena's body in
      its pool of blood. Then turns and goes.

      Gordy hits him. One of the jackhammer blows he slammed
      into Claudio in the bunker. A hard fist deep in the gut
      that drives all the wind from Brandt and drops him to his
      knees. Beat. Gordy's voice is cold and hard --

      Gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker. He's
      wearing civvies. He stops cranking, spoons out a huge
      dollop into a bowl.

      Gordy hands the bowl to Mauro, who's playing in the front
      seat of the pumper. Mauro tastes it. Thumbs up. Gordy
      smiles.

      Mike and the other men on Gordy's old shift are watching.
      To Gordy --

      Gordy turns to them. Looks into the faces of these men,
      the people closest to him in the world. Beat. Then --

<b>                                 GORDY

      Gordy's still in pain, still missing the wife and son
      he'll never see again. But Gordy's gonna be alright.

      Mauro's gonna be with him. There'll be fires to put out
      and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude
      of miseries and joys the firefighters in Spanish Harlem
      see each and every day.
