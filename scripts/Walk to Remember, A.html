A young man's V.O.:

<b>                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>           I was born in Beaufort, North
           Carolina. A place where the air
           always smells of pine and salt and
           sea.

The voice is gentle. Slightly Southern in inflection.   A
young doctor's soothing manner.


<b>FADE IN:
</b>

<b>EXT. COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA (DECEMBER) (PRESENT)
</b>
A vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers,
sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing.

<b>                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>           For many, days and nights are
           spent fishing Pamlico Sound or
           crabbing the Neuse River.

The CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor
on which fishermen toil.


<b>EXT. BEAUFORT, NORTH CAROLINA - MORNING (DECEMBER)
</b>
The CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses
decked with plastic rooftop Santas...

<b>                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>           While the ocean may be the focus
           of daily labor, churches have
           always tried to be the focus of
           life.

And MOVES UPHILL TO...


<b>EXT. MAIN STREET
</b>
Where fake snow is sprayed on store windows. The CAMERA
CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its
stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful
Christmas garlands.

<b>                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>           When I lived here, there were
           eighteen churches within town
           limits alone.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       2.
</b>
<b>EXT. FOUR-WAY STOP
</b>
From each corner, four churches face each other. The
Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the
Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All
Saints Church.

<b>                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>          They sponsored pancake breakfasts,
          rummage sales, car washes, and
          softball games.


<b>EXT. LANDON'S TRUCK - TRAVELING
</b>
The CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility
vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a
softball game.

<b>                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>          You'd think that all the people
          here were friendly, welcoming,
          open-hearted...

Dr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck.


<b>INT. CAR - TRAVELING
</b>
Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but
retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell
phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him.

<b>                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>          ... and that money or family
          background or education or luck
          didn't matter.

Landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a
simple gold wedding band on his left hand.


<b>EXT. STREET - TRAVELING
</b>
Landon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the
huge Southern Baptist church.

<b>                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>          But they did matter. They
          mattered to everyone. Except
          Jamie Sullivan...

Landon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church
and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the
buildings, a cemetery.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        3.
</b>
<b>EXT. CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a
different color than he remembers.

<b>                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>          ... Astronomer. Actress.
          Believer in God...

Landon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck.


<b>EXT. OLD PARSONAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch.
Presses the DOORBELL. It RINGS inside. Landon is edgy,
unsettled.

<b>                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>          ... Believer in me.

A nurse opens the door.

<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985)
</b>
ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as
"Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps,
richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.
Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.
A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.

Missing are the criminals...

A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING.
VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is
impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage
to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied,
feared.


<b>INT. CAMARO
</b>
EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic
skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.
Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>                 (impatient, edgy)
          Where is he? He's supposed to be
          here.

<b>                                                (CONTINUED)

</b>                    (from back seat)
             I need to whizz.

ERIC's skinny, high-energy.          A leg always jiggling.

<b>                             LANDON
</b>             Eric.    You're such a hummingbird.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>             I wanna dance.

BELINDA is Landon's girlfriend. Richie princess, a bad-
girl pretender. Big shoulder pads. Jellie bracelet.
Swatch watch.

<b>                              LANDON
</b>             So go dance.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>             With you.

<b>                              LANDON
</b>             I.    Don't.   Dance.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                    (pointing, like
                     Tattoo)
             Dee plane. Dee plane.

They laugh.       Clay's by the dumpster.


<b>EXT. DUMPSTER
</b>
CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is
dumping garbage from a trash can. A loud HONK. Clay
turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school,
coast clear. He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as
the Camaro pulls up.

Eric pushes a door open.       Empties fall from the back seat.
Clay climbs in.

<b>                              CLAY
</b>             Go go go go.

PRINCIPAL ED KELLY, middle-aged, pockmarked skin, Casio
calculator watch, exits the gym.


<b>INT. CAMARO
</b>
Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror.

<b>                                                      (CONTINUED)

</b>                    (mocking)
             Kelly. He looks like his face
             caught fire and he tried to put it
             out with a fork.

Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing
Kelly.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>             He couldn't find his own butt with
             both hands at high noon in a hall
             of mirrors.

Sniggering laughter.

<b>                           CLAY
</b>             Go!

Landon presses the gas.    The CAR ROARS away.

<b>                           CLAY
</b>             Kelly's so old he --

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             We're done with that already,
             bonehead.

Clay smiles, good-natured.    He often misses social cues.


<b>EXT. CAMARO - TRAVELING
</b>
Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the
road. Another car runs it over.


<b>EXT. ROAD
</b>
Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest. Shakes it.
Frustrated. Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.


<b>EXT. OUTSIDE CEMETERY GATE - LITTLE LATER
</b>
Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights
shining through the locked rear gate. JOHN COUGAR
MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.


<b>INT. CAMARO
</b>
Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed.
Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.

<b>                           ERIC (O.S.)
</b>             So which is it?


<b>EXT. CAMARO
</b>
Eric finishes taking a leak.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                    (calling over,
                     repeating)
             Landon. To save your life, you
             have to either go deaf or go numb
             in your dick and balls.

Eric climbs back in the car.


<b>INT. CAMARO
</b>
Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric.

<b>                             LANDON
</b>             I'm thinking.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>             No thinking. The doctor only
             gives you three seconds to
             decide --

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Could I lose one ear and one nut?

<b>                           ERIC

<b>                             BELINDA
</b>             Don't wonder.

Landon's looking out at the night.

Everyone looks up.     Derisive laughter.


<b>THEIR POV
</b>
A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the
gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she
probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She
lives in her mind, not her body.


<b>BACK TO SCENE

</b>             Cherry.


<b>EXT. CAMARO
</b>
JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and
approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the
GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her
chest.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>                    (to Landon,
                     tentative)

             If you want the lights off, I'll
             turn them off.

And he does.    Darkness.

<b>                            JAMIE
</b>             Thank you.   Thank you so very
             much.

She backs away from the car, grateful.        From the car:

<b>                           BELINDA (O.S.)
</b>             I can't see a friggin' thing.

But Landon's looking at Jamie.     Almost counting the
seconds...


<b>HIS POV

Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Landon quickly flicks the high beams.     Belinda, Eric, and
Clay snicker and snort as they see --


<b>EXT. CEMETERY GATE
</b>
Jamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of
looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even.
A moment later, she jumps down on the far side.
Disappears.


<b>INT. CAMARO

Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.       Landon's smiling.

Laughter.

He clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But
Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where
he'd really like to be.

Laughter.    Landon kisses her.      With tongue.

A blinding white light dances through the car and settles
on Landon and Belinda's faces.

<b>                            LANDON

They stare at each other.   His annoyance turns to mild
respect.

Nobody answers.

Landon turns the car around.


<b>EXT. ACCESS ROAD

The Camaro fishtails away. TIRES CRUNCHING, red
taillights bouncing on the rough road. The car turns left
onto the paved road and speeds out of sight.

Landon drives recklessly.   Rushing.   He makes a SCREECHING
turn.


<b>LANDON'S POV - STREET AHEAD

Two fire trucks rumbling by houses, SIRENS WAILING.

The Camaro swerves.     TIRES SQUEALING.   A LOUD, HEART-

The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt.

The CAMARO SLAMS into a light pole.     CRUNCHING METAL.

Belinda's head leans on the dash. Her shoulders shake.
Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over. Scared.

She lifts her head.     Looks at him.   She's laughing.   He
kicks his door out.


<b>EXT. STREET
</b>
The Camaro crumpled into the light pole. Headlights
askew. Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed.

Landon runs to the old man. Kneels. Shakes him.       No
response. The man's TERRIER BARKS at Landon.


<b>LANDON'S FACE
</b>
Frightened, anguished.     The real Landon showing for an

Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER.


<b>EXT. OLD CHEVETTE - HALF HOUR LATER

A battered Chevette steers through a working-class
neighborhood.


<b>INT. CHEVETTE

Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with
sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy
black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.

He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile.

His forehead still shows a bruise.

</b>          I had hopes for you.

<b>                        LANDON

On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out
of the Camaro.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          Those aren't mine.

Kelly holds up the police test finding.

<b>EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER
</b>
Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous
political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the
courtyard. Not a care in the world.


<b>EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - HOUR LATER
</b>
Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro. A
neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on
his way to school.


<b>EXT. CAMARO - MINUTES LATER
</b>
Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath,
the body, the paint. A discouraging mess.


<b>INT. CARTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door.

</b>
A murky place.   Filled with old tools and junk and a grim
old bike.


<b>EXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER
</b>
Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his
bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop.
A bus approaching.


<b>EXT. UNDER CAMARO - LATER

BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard.    A

He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out.


<b>EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY

The mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands
there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much.

<b>                        CYNTHIA

</b>          'Bout what?

<b>                          CYNTHIA

          You could be manager someday.

Landon can't believe this.


<b>EXT. DRIVEWAY
</b>
Landon slides back out.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          I'm not working there.

Cynthia sets her jaw.   He knows that look.


<b>INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR
</b>
Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his
head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's
making some headway; only two more to wash.

MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair.
Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's
sink. Landon glimpses his future.


<b>INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OUTER OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON

Landon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX,
quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.

<b>                        LANDON

with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN.
Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by.

                   surprised)
          Back?   Were you ever really here?

They both know Kelly has the upper hand.   Kelly leans back
in his chair, relishing it.

way.

Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open

<b>INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING

Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing
"Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading,
not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.    He
rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a
Sony Walkman, glum.

<b>INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER

A big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of
heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits
with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry
text between them.

Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the

off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie
studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student,

That old man.

<b>                           JAMIE

If he heard her, he makes no sign.     She goes back to her
book. A long beat, then:

She reads again. The bus pulls to a stop in front of
Beaufort High. Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting,
leaning on her Cabriolet. Jamie watches Landon exit the
bus.

Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club.


<b>LANDON'S POV

A big space with a stage. MS. GARBER stands before six
geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie.

Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these
places? Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.

<b>                        MS. GARBER
</b>          We're waiting, Mr. Carter.

He slides in a row behind the others. Leans forward and
pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES. Eddie's pimply and talks with
his eyes squinched up.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          What's the play?

Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.

<b>                        EDDIE
</b>          The-the-there's this drought an'
          -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy

          rain --

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          -- And the ugly farmer's daughter
          falls for him. I saw the movie.

<b>                         EDDIE
</b>          Yeah.   It's really g-g-good --

<b>                           LANDON
</b>          -- It blows.


<b>ON STAGE - MINUTES LATER
</b>
Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from
scripts. Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>                 (as Starbuck)

Jamie smiles.    Garber taps her script -- continue.

             You'll look in that mirror and
             you'll be more than pretty.
             You'll be beautiful.'

Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>                    (as Starbuck)
             'Look at me. Tell me what you

As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes.

             'Yes. You're-you're b-b-

Hoots and laughter.    Jamie looks away, humiliated.

<b>                           MS. GARBER

                    (announcing)
             Landon will play the role of Bill

Groans among the boys.    Jamie is horrified.    So is Landon.

Everyone stares at Landon.     He's trapped.


<b>EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING

Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands
under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for
a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind.

<b>                           LANDON

Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind
him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             But you have to make it a big joke

He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             You don't care about classes or
             graduating. But you like school
             because you're popular and you
             know you'll never be on top again.

<b>                              LANDON
</b>             That's deep --

<b>                           JAMIE

<b>                              LANDON
</b>             My act?!

She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.     The last
car in the parking lot.

Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears
twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the
Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.

Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.

<b>                            LANDON

The wet road glistens.

He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out.      He's
searching the dash -- no cassette player.

<b>                           LANDON

She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the
wrong side of the road. He grips the dash.

A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.

Landon drops his attitude, his act.   He toys with the
glove compartment knob.

<b>                         LANDON

Landon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty.   His
bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.

<b>                         LANDON
</b>          Hey.   Landon Carter.

Landon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly,
eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans,
dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.

Jamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a
white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE
CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps.

          But nobody's pressing charges.

The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the
kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed
bush. Not the best place.

<b>                        JAMIE

Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon
pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie
with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is

cheerful.

Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt.

Jamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping.     She
tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out.


<b>EXT. REAR ACCESS ROAD TO CEMETERY - TEN MINUTES LATER

Landon is waiting when Jamie appears. He has scripts in
his back pocket. They smile at each other, laugh.

<b>                           JAMIE

</b>             Yeah.   But that can be good.

walking away. He follows.

<b>                           JAMIE

</b>             My father's alive but it's like
             he's dead.

She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a
storage shed. Opens the door. Enters. Returns a moment
later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made
cylindrical device.

<b>                             LANDON

and changes its view.

Pause.

He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back
pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She
takes it.

<b>INT. PARSONAGE - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door.
A light glows under the door, then goes out.


<b>INT. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM
</b>
He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back
to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet.


<b>INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
Dreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS,
past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature
documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and
paper. Titles it "Life List." Pause. He doesn't know
what to write.


<b>EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL)
</b>
Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by
Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same

They look.    Jamie's watching them.   They laugh.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>             She wants to jump Landon's bones.

<b>                           BELINDA

<b>                           LANDON

He doesn't respond.      She shifts from foot to foot.
Confused.

</b>             The play's going to be really

</b>                    (mocking her)
             I'm really glad you think so.

His friends snicker and guffaw.      She looks at them, then
back to Landon.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             You guessed right.

She gives him a funny look and walks away.      A better
person than he and he knows it.

<b>                           BELINDA
</b>             That's one girl who can't take a
             hint.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Because she doesn't know what a
             hint is.

They laugh. Landon the loudest.      It feels good, but he
also feels a little... bad.


<b>INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
Cleaned up. Swept out. The Camaro is still a dented
mess. But Landon drops its hood down, wipes his hands,
and climbs behind the wheel. The ENGINE STARTS.

No posters of pop stars. Books by Houston Smith, Thomas

</b>

<b>INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie opens the front door. Landon. A stern voice from
the living room. Reverend Sullivan's.

Jamie shuts the door.

</b>             Belinda's a very jealous person.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             That would be the reason.

Pause.   He thinks she might be going for this.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             So it's like you want to be secret

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             Then maybe you can read mine.

She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and
opens it. Before she goes in:

</b>             I thought I saw something in you,
             something good. But I was wrong.


<b>INT. SULLIVAN FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost
crying. In the living room, her father looks up from his
reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out,
glowers.

Landon standing in the front yard, confused that Jamie
would reject his generous offer of friendship.

Landon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage.

The front door opens, startling Landon. It's the
Reverend. Red-faced with fury. Landon glares back, but
then climbs in his car and drives off. Ashamed.

Jamie sits on the sofa.   Her father doesn't look up from
his reading.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          The first time I met him I knew.
          I'm proud of how you're handling
          yourself.

Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and
heartbreak. She leaves before her father can see her
distress.


<b>INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
</b>
Landon lies in bed watching another British nature
DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy. He reaches for his
school yearbook. Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's
photo.

She's smiling and looks almost cute. Listed under her
photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama.

</b>          Scalene?

<b>                         LANDON
</b>          Okay.   Make me an isosceles.

Luis steps outward, directly opposite Landon.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>          Yes!    Two sides the same.

Landon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances
over from a picnic table where she works with her student,
Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks
back. Thoughtful. Watching her. But not staring.

Landon changes the line and nails it. Surprising himself.
Surprising her. They both know it's sincere. A moment

He leans in. She closes her eyes. They kiss. Gently,
genuinely. When Jamie opens her eyes, they are filled

<b>                             LANDON
</b>             Not hungry.

Landon moves toward his Camaro.

<b>                          DR. CARTER
</b>             Landon! Please. Don't walk away
             from me.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Like you walked away from us?

Landon opens his car door and gets in.         Not forgiving.


<b>INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING
</b>
Landon waits by Jamie's locker.       The BELL RINGS.   No
Jamie.


<b>INT. CAFETERIA - NOON
</b>
Landon walks along the lunch line, looking.        No Jamie.


<b>INT. LIBRARY - LATER
</b>
Many many books. Landon cruises the stacks. No Jamie.
Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon
and turns away. He doesn't pursue it.


<b>EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - DUSK
</b>
Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro.
They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor
kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over.

Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her?

<b>                            ERIC
</b>             Belinda's telling everyone that
             kiss was real.

<b>                             LANDON
</b>             It was.

Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>             And that you're scamming on Jamie
             Sullivan.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>                    (not denying it)
             Scamming's a strong word.


<b>INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING
</b>
Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her
hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             You weren't in school yesterday.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             I went to the doctor with my

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             Healthy as can be.

Pause. She doesn't help him.          She opens her locker, gets
what she needs.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             You were great the other night.

<b>                            JAMIE

Pause.   He tries to touch her hair.       She ducks.

</b>             I haven't been nice to you.

<b>INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

Jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater.
Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>             Landon!

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Later.

Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.      Making a
public statement.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             People can see.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             And that would ruin your
             reputation how?

She goes back to her book.    Ignoring him.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>                    (re: her book)
             What's that?

She doesn't look up.    Shows him the spine:     The Scarlet
Letter.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             I'm reading all the novels on Mr.

             A hundred. Then there's his
             classics list. And his European
             list.

Landon realizes this is why she's always reading.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             That on your 'Life List.'    To read

She doesn't deny it.       He just dives in.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>             Jamie. Maybe I want to try being
             positive.

She looks up.    Examines his face for the truth.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Maybe I miss doing that dumb play
             with you.

Students seated near them have overheard.      Whisper.

<b>                           LANDON

<b>                           JAMIE

<b>                             JAMIE

She picks up her books and tray.      Everyone is watching.

<b>                             LANDON
</b>             I just did!


<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL

Landon follows Jamie out of the building.      Catches up.

She gets into her car. Slams the door.        STARTS the
ENGINE. She recognizes the truth.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             But the real reason you're scared?

<b>EXT. BRIDGE OVER INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY - NIGHT

Landon sits alone. Legs dangling over. Lighting and
dropping matches into the black beyond his feet. His body
caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights.

Nearby, an abandoned car.     A rusty old Yugo.


<b>INT. CARTER KITCHEN - NIGHT

Landon comes in from outside. Is surprised to find
Cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform.

<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCIENCE LAB - NEXT AFTERNOON

The door is open to a lab where Jamie and the Star Club is
meeting. Landon mops, working hard, while listening in.

Mr. Kelly watches from near the trophy case.      Almost
approving.

at Landon. Wonders.


<b>EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - SATURDAY (DECEMBER)

Landon parks his Camaro.       It's shiny and buffed and
perfect again.


<b>INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER

A Christmas party for the tutors and tutored. A ROCK 'N'

A sign reads: "Win Movie Tickets."

Landon enters, buys a ticket, then takes off his leather
jacket. Underneath, a nice shirt and tie.


<b>LANDON'S POV

laughing with her student, Isabel. Mr. Kelly talking with

Applause. This is new. Landon looks at Jamie, who's
smiling. She steps to the microphone.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             I need to go out.

Pause.

<b>                           CYNTHIA

</b>             No.   I won't be long.

He senses her hurt, but leaves anyway.


<b>INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A Christmas tree with large colored lights stand in a
corner. Jamie and her father playing cards. The DOORBELL
RINGS. Then urgent BANGING.

Landon slides his backpack off his shoulder.      Pulls out a
shopping bag. Holds it out to Jamie.

</b>                    (awkward)
             It's a present. Take it.

She does. She opens the bag, pulls out a beautiful pink
sweater. She's overwhelmed.

Without a word, just a happy smile, Landon hops down the
steps toward his car. Reverend Sullivan appears in the
doorway.

<b>                           LANDON

Jamie hums to herself as she brushes her hair. She's
wearing the new sweater. Her father KNOCKS. Enters.

<b>                         REV. SULLIVAN

           Up to?

<b>                         REV. SULLIVAN
</b>           I thought we had rid ourselves of

</b>           Dad, why don't you get to the

<b>                         REV. SULLIVAN

Jamie doesn't answer.

<b>                         REV. SULLIVAN
</b>           Did you give him a gift?

<b>                            JAMIE

<b>                         REV. SULLIVAN
</b>           I saw the way he looked at you.
           The way he kissed you.

<b>                            JAMIE
</b>           It was a play.

<b>                         REV. SULLIVAN
</b>                  (unconvinced)
           Boys like him have --
           expectations.

<b>                         JAMIE
</b>           I have expectations, too.

Pause.   He's feeling her grow up, grow away.

<b>                         REV. SULLIVAN
</b>           I'm not changing the rules.

<b>                         JAMIE

They eye each other.    He's losing her.

<b>INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - LATER THAT EVENING
</b>
A nurse points Landon toward a patient room.     He carries a
battered liquor-store box.


<b>INT. PATIENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
A TV flickers. Landon comes in. Opens the box.      Pulls
out the evergreen wreath with the plaid bow.

<b>                       LANDON
</b>          For me. Christmas is all about
          the smells.

Landon leans the wreath in the window. HAROLD KEENE --
the old man from the accident, watches from his bed,
baffled.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          Pine's my favorite. That and
          cider with cloves.

Landon pulls a Thermos from his coat pocket.     Unscrews the
cap. Finds a drinking cup. Pours in cider.       Offers
Harold the cup.

<b>                           HAROLD
</b>          Who are you?

</b>          You.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>          Me.

Harold takes the cup, looks Landon over.    Landon appears
genuinely contrite.

Harold reaches under his pillow.         Pulls out a small bottle
of liquor. Tops off his cider.

<b>                           HAROLD
</b>             Get yourself a glass.

Harold nods, liking Landon.

<b>                              LANDON

<b>EXT. RURAL ROADS - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
Landon speeds, the windows open, WIND WHIPPING, DIRE
STRAITS BLASTING. The Camaro turns and brakes and turns
again, kicking up gravel, raising hell. The car slides to
a stop.


<b>INT. CAMARO
</b>
Landon turns OFF the RADIO. Sits still. Wipes the
rearview mirror clean, spotless. Unties the dangling
plastic skeleton and pockets it.

Colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk WIND.        Landon
talks with a used car SALESMAN.

</b>             It's got a new V-6 and
             transmission. Alloy wheels.

             Twelve hundred.

</b>             New paint. Extra chrome.     Not a
             scratch anywhere.

<b>                           SALESMAN

</b>             Reconditioned. Completely. Be a
             collector's someday. Twelve
             hundred.

They look at the Camaro.    Shining in the sun.

<b>                           SALESMAN
</b>             You can't expect me to pay you for
             your -- attachment to that car.

Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then
adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>             I don't. I expect you to pay me
             for yours.

The Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad
of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills.
Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then
walks away.


<b>EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - FRONT LAWN - NEXT MORNING

The marquee reads, "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"


<b>EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

One car. An old station wagon.        At the parking space, a
sign: "School Principal Only."

Kelly looks up from paperwork.

Landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk.

             It's mine to give. I didn't steal
             it.

<b>                           MR. KELLY
</b>             I didn't say you did.

But his tone implied it and Landon's already gone. Kelly
is immediately sorry. He goes to his window and sees
Landon pedal away on the old bike.


<b>EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY
</b>
Landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo. When
the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk.

fives Josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in.

A seafood joint on the waterfront. Quaint, not fancy.
Twinkle lights illuminate Jamie's face. Landon finds her
lovely. Jamie picks.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             I know you want to.

She grins.    And tries.   A small burp.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Bring the air all the way up from
             your stomach.

He belches again.    Just as loud.   She tries again,
laughing.


<b>EXT. YUGO
</b>
Landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature
golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little
League diamond. A family entertainment center.

Jamie sees where they are.

             like on your list.

She waits for more.

<b>                            LANDON
</b>             It's about working with what you
             already have -- right now -- at

<b>INT. BATTING CAGE - NIGHT
</b>
Jamie's in the cage with a helmet on.    A machine tosses
balls. Landon coaches from outside.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Swing! Keep your bat parallel to
             the ground. Follow through.
             Follow through!

Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls
keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the
fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd
be embracing if the fence weren't there.

In the b.g., kids from their school.    Giggling,
whispering.

Landon looks over at them.

<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - TRAVELING - NIGHT

The YUGO ROARS down the asphalt.    A sign for the
approaching state line whips by.

Jamie and Landon.    With STEVIE NICKS' "Talk to Me" ON the

He leaps out, leaving the headlights on.


<b>EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Landon takes Jamie's hand and pulls her toward some
invisible place.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             Where -- what -- are we -- ?

He keeps tugging her.     She follows him.   Laughing.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Stand right here.

<b>                            JAMIE
</b>             Where?

He leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the
other. He notices a large bruise on her leg. She brushes
her dress down.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             You're acting like a crazy person.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             You're straddling the state line.
             You're in two places at once.

She's thrilled at his solution to her wish.       He walks to
the shoulder of the road.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Repeat after me.

They reach the end of the dock. She turns to face the
WIND. It blows her hair. She turns his face the same
way.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             It's like the wind. I can't see
             it but I feel it.

He closes his eyes.       Feeling the wind.   Opens them again,
rejecting the idea.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             We can measure wind.

<b>                            JAMIE

             Love.

She's embarrassed.       She tries to avoid implying anything.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             My mother told me God is love, so
             when you're feeling love, you're

             I think talking about these things
             -- threatens their very beauty and

Her tone is matter-of-fact, but Landon's got a serious and
tender look on his face. He touches her hair.

He moves closer.

She looks down.    Shy.

He touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth. Then leans in
and kisses her. A tender, soft kiss. He pulls away.
They look at each other a moment.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             I love you, Jamie.

There, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling
foolish. Not the old Landon. Jamie looks away. Mixed
emotions. Happy and sad.

             I can't -- explain.

She turns back to him, her eyes shining.     She touches his
face and they kiss again, deeply.

But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his
shoulder. Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof,
staring at the water. He pulls away slightly to study her
face. He touches her cheek and brings her back from
wherever she's been.

<b>                           JAMIE

Tears run down her cheeks. Landon wipes them away with
his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.


<b>EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LATER

Landon follows Jamie up the steps. The lights in the
living room are on. THROUGH the windows, they can see her
father taking down the Christmas tree.

<b>                              JAMIE

He pulls her to him.      Kisses her.     The front door opens.

Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over
her shoulder.

And he goes. Jamie walks by her father and into the
house. Not saying anything. He watches her. What has he
allowed?


<b>EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

Bang, bang, bang. Landon kicks in every locker in his

by his anger. But then he turns to her and grins.

<b>                        LANDON

<b>INT. CAFETERIA - NOON

Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie
approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful.

She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's
being diminished, ostracized. She thinks he doesn't see
her. But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for
her and smiles. She sits. Landon sees her face.

<b>                           LANDON

They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets
sky.

He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit
and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the
deck. Shuffles like a card shark.


<b>EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT (FEW DAYS LATER)

Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up.       He

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             That's what I thought.

He reaches back into his backpack.      Pulls out a second
blanket.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Ergo, a second blanket.   One for
             me, one for you.

He hands her one.     She takes it, smiling, reassured.

<b>                             JAMIE

Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed.      His feet find slippers
on the floor.


<b>INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Reverend Sullivan, wearing a robe, enters quietly.
Checking on his daughter. Her bed is empty.

The old Pontiac slows.

Reverend Sullivan looks down the access road to the rear
cemetery gate.

The Yugo parked by the gate.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
The Reverend struggles with what to do. After a moment,
he decides not to interfere; he'll pick his moment. He
keeps driving.


<b>INT. CEMETERY
</b>
Jamie and Landon are looking at the heavens through the
telescope.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>          Where's Pluto?

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>          In Virgo, but it's about 1000
          times too faint to see.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          What's the best thing I can see
          tonight?

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>          Me.

He draws her close, they kiss. She shyly pulls away.
Their hands still touching until she looks again into the
telescope eyepiece.

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>          The second best thing is Jupiter.

She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and
steps aside so he can look. But he picks up the
flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          Can you locate XXI5639I?

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>          Sure.

She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope.

<b>                            LANDON
</b>             Because I had it named for you.     I
             know it's not an official
             designation --

She couldn't be happier.     She reaches for his hand.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             It's wonderful. I love you.

It's the first time he's heard it. He pulls her into his
arms. They kiss. Passionately. She starts to object.

<b>                            LANDON
</b>                     (respecting her
                      boundaries)
             Okay.   I'm stopping.

And he does.    They snuggle.   Silence, then:

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             What's number one?

Long pause.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>                    (very shy)
             In April when the dogwoods and
             wisteria are blooming... Get
             married.

He doesn't make fun.     He strokes her hair.    Kisses her
forehead.


<b>INT. KITCHEN - 5 AM

Landon enters from outside. Cynthia, still in her

coffee.

<b>                           CYNTHIA
</b>             You sleeping with her?

Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.

<b>                           CYNTHIA
</b>             I was cleaning yesterday.   I found
             this.

She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket.      Landon is
horrified. She reads it.

<b>                            CYNTHIA

             She talking to you 'bout this
             stuff?

Landon doesn't answer. She puts the list on the table.
Smoothes it. Gently discouraging.

<b>                           CYNTHIA
</b>             Honey, some of this is...

<b>                           LANDON

<b>                          CYNTHIA
</b>             You do. You're handsome and
             charming.

<b>                           LANDON

<b>                           CYNTHIA
</b>             That's eight years of school and
             training -- after college. And
             all that doesn't necessarily make
             you a better human being.

<b>                           LANDON

be practical and realistic.

             guy, a war vet or something, who

             Lincoln's hand.

             Made a big impression on him.

Reverend Sullivan looks at his daughter.       She's nodding,
interested.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             My cousin Mike. He's from a big

Jamie smiles.

Tears are running down her face.        He pulls the car over.


<b>EXT. WOODS BY SIDE OF ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Jamie gets out of the car.       Landon quickly follows.

<b>                              LANDON
</b>             Jamie --

<b>                              JAMIE
</b>             I'm sick.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Then I'll take you home.      You'll
             feel better tomorrow.

He tries to take her arm. She shakes off his hand, steps
back. Wanting to be heard and understood.

<b>                          JAMIE
</b>             Landon. I'm sick -- with
             leukemia.

Landon tries to say something.         Nothing comes out.   His
soul numb.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             I found out last winter. I'm not
             responding to treatment anymore.

His face crumples with pain and anguish.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Why didn't you tell me?

<b>                            JAMIE
</b>             The doctors said to do everything
             the same as long as possible.
                    (pause)
             I didn't want anyone being --
             weird around me.

<b>                              LANDON
</b>             Including me?!

             God gives me an illness, then you.
             A cruel joke.

She gets in the car. Slams her door shut.       He stands
there, not knowing what to do.


<b>EXT. YUGO - TRAVELING - LATER
</b>
Landon pulls up in front of Jamie's house.      A long quiet
ride.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             I'm not letting you die.

Jamie just looks at him.    Feeling sorry for him -- what he
wants doesn't matter.


<b>INT. SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT
</b>
The Reverend and Landon drink coffee.

<b>                            REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             It's her decision and she's
             decided not to tell people -- at
             least for now.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             How -- how long does she have?

<b>                           REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             Two, three months. Maybe less.
             Maybe more.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             So you've given up.

Reverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice.

<b>                           REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             Her doctors have. Jamie and I.
             We're still praying for a miracle.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>                    (disdainful)
             Praying.

</b>             If there is a God, how could he

It's a long answer and by the time the Reverend opens his
mouth to explain, Landon's out the door.


<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Moonless dark. Few cars. The YUGO RIPS down the road.
Landon opens a map over the steering wheel. Turns on the
dome light. Looks at the return address on an old letter.


<b>EXT. CITY STREETS (RALEIGH) - 3 A.M.
</b>
Landon's Yugo winds through city streets.


<b>EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD (RALEIGH) - MINUTES LATER
</b>
Mansions. Big lawns. The Yugo slows as Landon leans
forward to read a street sign. His face is tear-streaked.
He flicks his headlights to bright, then low again.

The car turns left.


<b>EXT. DR. CARTER'S HOME - MINUTE LATER
</b>
Large new colonial. Landon slams his car door and stands
in the street. Staring at his father's house. He heads
up a flagstone path for the front door.


<b>EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Landon RINGS the resounding DING-DONG BELL, then bangs on
the heavy wood door. Grief-stricken.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Dr. Carter!... Carter!... Dad!
             Please!! I have to talk to you!!


<b>INT. DR. CARTER'S HOME
</b>
Elegant, thick carpets. Dr. Carter, putting on his robe,
parts the silk drapes in the upstairs hall.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         90.

<b>DR. CARTER'S POV
</b>
His son standing on the front lawn.     Distraught, tearful.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>          Open the door!     Please!!


<b>EXT. DR. CARTER'S HOME
</b>
Landon backs away from the house. Angrily kicks over a
decorative planter. Is halfway to his car when Dr. Carter
opens the door and comes out.

<b>                           DR. CARTER
</b>          Landon!

Landon doesn't hear.

<b>                           DR. CARTER
</b>          Landon!!

Landon turns around. Sees his father. Breaks down,
sobbing. His father goes to him. Hugs him, a big bear
hug.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          You have to save her!

<b>                         DR. CARTER
</b>          Landon, who?   Is your mother all
          right?

Lights pop upstairs.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          It's Jamie -- my girlfriend -- she
          has cancer -- you have to come
          look at her -- right now!

<b>                        DR. CARTER
</b>                 (calm, trying to
                  diffuse)
          It's the middle of the night --

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          I don't give a shit what time it
          is!

Landon pulls away.   Angrier.

<b>                        DR. CARTER
</b>          Landon, I'm a cardiologist, not an
          oncologist --

He waves his father off, dismissing him.

<b>                            DR. CARTER
</b>             Landon!   I'll look into it!!

But Landon hasn't heard. He's in his car. Dr. Carter
watches his son's car move away, regretful.


<b>INT. CARTER KITCHEN - DAWN
</b>
Landon quietly shuts the back door.        Exhausted.   Starts
making coffee. Cynthia appears.

<b>                           CYNTHIA
</b>             Your father called.

No response.

<b>                           CYNTHIA
</b>             Jamie's a patient at his hospital.
             He's having a colleague look at
             her chart this morning.

Long pause.

<b>                            CYNTHIA
</b>             I'm sorry.   I didn't know.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             I didn't know either.


<b>EXT. PARSONAGE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
The Yugo parked in the driveway. The morning paper lying
on the grass. Landon paces in front of the front porch.
Incapable of ringing the bell, lacking the courage,
lacking the right words.

Upstairs, the curtains move.


<b>INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM
</b>
Jamie looks out the window.


<b>JAMIE'S POV
</b>
Landon pacing, talking to himself.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        92.
</b>
<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
She starts to raise the window, to say something, to help
him, but then lets the curtain drop. She needs for him to
decide, for him to be ready to face this with her.

The sound of a CAR.   She looks out the window again.


<b>JAMIE'S POV
</b>
The Yugo driving away.


<b>INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Landon lies on his bed in the dark. The PHONE RINGS.
Landon stares at his extension. The RINGING STOPS. A
voice from downstairs.

<b>                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
</b>          It's your father.

Landon picks up his phone.


<b>INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - TWO MINUTES LATER
</b>
The door to Landon's room is ajar. Cynthia waits outside.
Listening. Hearing nothing. She pushes the door open.


<b>CYNTHIA'S POV
</b>
Landon sitting on his bed.   Deflated.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          He can't do anything.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Cynthia is pained to see his suffering.

<b>                        CYNTHIA
</b>          If it's incurable --

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          I told him to leave me alone.

<b>                         CYNTHIA
</b>          Landon --

<b>                        LANDON
</b>                 (re: Jamie)
          It was the only thing I've ever

</b>
Landon's still in bed. Facing the wall.     Cynthia KNOCKS.
Enters with a plate of food.

<b>                        CYNTHIA
</b>          I brought some dinner.

No response.   She leaves the tray and goes.


<b>INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN KITCHEN - SAME TIME
</b>
Jamie and her father eat dinner.   Jamie is red-eyed,
heartbroken.

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>                 (not sure at all)
          He'll call.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          I wanted to think he'd changed.

<b>                          JAMIE
</b>                  (angry)
          No you didn't.
                  (beat)
          But he did change. Just not
          enough.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          Jamie, you're not mad at me.
          You're mad at Landon --

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>                 (furious)
          I am mad at you! And at Landon!
          And the universe! And God!
                 (quieter)
          I don't even know where to put all
          my anger.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          That's normal. God accepts your
          anger. He won't punish you.

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>          By making me ill, he is punishing
          me!
                 (quieter)
          I just don't know what for.

She flees the room.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Goes up the stairs.    Keeps going.   Up another flight to
the attic.


<b>INT. PARSONAGE ATTIC - MINUTE LATER
</b>
Jamie opens a closet door. Pulls out a dress, a scarf,
jewelry, a worn book -- her mother's belongings. She
opens the book and starts to weep. Missing her mother.


<b>FOOT OF ATTIC STAIRS
</b>
Reverend Sullivan stands, looking up at the attic stairs.
Frustrated, angry, worried.


<b>INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY
</b>
Landon is still in bed. Cynthia enters.      Pulls back the
curtains. Yanks up the shades.

<b>                         CYNTHIA
</b>           I don't care if you don't leave
           the house. But you have to get
           out of bed.


<b>INT. CARTER KITCHEN - FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
Landon sits at the kitchen table.     Cynthia pours him a cup
of coffee.

<b>                         CYNTHIA
</b>           You and I may not be communicating
           very well right now. But let me
           be clear. Don't make this about
           you. It's about her.

Pause.   Her words sink in.

<b>                         LANDON
</b>           I have no idea what to say. How
           to act. What if I do the wrong

<b>                         CYNTHIA

<b>EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LITTLE LATER
</b>
Before Landon can ring the bell, the front door opens.
The Reverend. Landon runs past him into the house.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          Where's Jamie?!

<b>                          REV. SULLIVAN

Oh.


<b>INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - HALF HOUR LATER
</b>
Deserted, classes are meeting. Landon runs, sliding to a
stop at one classroom door. Looks in, keeps going, stops
at another. Searching.


This is JAMIE'S POV from the top of the hallway.


<b>JAMIE
</b>
She stands, holding her books, watching him, unsure.


<b>LANDON
</b>
finally feels her gaze, turns to look.


<b>JAMIE
</b>
turns away, still angry and disappointed.


<b>LANDON
</b>
runs to her.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>          Jamie!

He catches up to her.


<b>JAMIE AND LANDON
</b>
face each other.   Neither sure what to say.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>          I'm so sorry.    I'm a coward --

             things I love kept me healthy

Pause.

<b>                           LANDON

She means not even God and he gets this.

<b>INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - EVENING (MID-FEBRUARY)
</b>
A small group of students sit on stage reading from Our
Town, rehearsing. Jamie and Landon sit together in the
third row, holding hands. Landon glances at her, realizes
she's asleep. Pulls her sweater over her.


<b>INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING
</b>
Landon sits with Luis; Jamie at the next table with
Isabel. She looks pale. He catches her eye. They both
smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students.

He places a red heart-shaped box in her lap.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>                   (apologetic)
            Not very original. Happy
            Valentine's Day.

He grins.   She looks crestfallen, feels terrible.

<b>                          JAMIE
</b>            I didn't even think about it.

He takes a chocolate.     Pops it in his mouth.   Grins.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>            There.   You gave me a chocolate.

<b>EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
</b>
Jamie and Landon are looking at stars.      A long quiet
moment.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>            What are you thinking?

<b>                          JAMIE

<b>                          JAMIE
</b>            I don't want to come here anymore.

She begins taking the telescope apart.      Depressed.


<b>EXT. CEMETERY GATE - HALF HOUR LATER
</b>
Jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a
pocket for a key. Unlocks the gate. Swings the gate
open. Landon's astonished.

<b>                          LANDON
</b>            You have a key?

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>            Yeah.  I've just never needed it.
                   (pause)
            Will you talk to my father?

<b>                          LANDON

<b>                          JAMIE
</b>            That's what I mean.

Their eyes meet.     Her look is serious.


<b>EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - NEXT DAY
</b>
Reverend Sullivan is up a ladder. Cleaning a gutter.
Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve.
He walks over.


<b>ON LADDER
</b>
The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below.       A
long beat, then:

</b>                    (calling up)
             Sir. Being ignored is beginning
             to feel preferable to being
             noticed.

The Reverend looks down.

<b>                            LANDON
</b>             I'll be honest. I don't know if I
             can pray, but I can do just about
             anything else.

Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the
house and walk over.


<b>ON GROUND
</b>
Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend
better.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie
             needs. I'm here.
                    (beat)
             I could start by driving her to
             school --

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             I'm not going back to school.

Landon and her father both turn to her.      Pale, wane.   They
understand what she is saying.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>             You can tell anyone you want.   I
             don't care.

She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan
look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't
sound like her.


<b>INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING
</b>
Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out
Jamie's locker.

Students stare as he carefully places her things,
including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part
and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and
Eric step forward.

                       genuine)
             No.    Hey. We're sorry, man!

Landon turns back. Surprised.        Inspects Belinda.   Eric.
Clay. Others. No one speaks.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Too late and not enough.

He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the
office.


<b>INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Mr. Kelly and Landon.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             I know it means not graduating,
             but I need to be excused from all

<b>                           MR. KELLY

Landon heads for the door.

<b>                              MR. KELLY
</b>             How is she?

Landon can't answer.       Too emotional.

<b>                           MR. KELLY
</b>             You will graduate.

Landon looks up, astounded.

<b>                           MR. KELLY
</b>             If I have to tutor you myself.

Landon nods, accepting, appreciative.

<b>INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
Landon puts away the contents of the shopping bag.
Jamie's in bed, wearing the sweater.

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>          Yesterday I felt sick, horrible.
          Today I feel like riding my bike.
          Or dancing.

He turns on the CLOCK RADIO next to her bed. Finds a
WALTZ. Offers his hand. Pulls her out of bed. She's in
pajamas.

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>          You know how to waltz??

<b>                        LANDON
</b>                 (bashful)
          I was going to fake it.

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>          I always fake it.

So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding
each other.


<b>INT. PARSONAGE - STAIRCASE - SAME TIME
</b>
Reverend Sullivan hears the MUSIC and LAUGHTER.   He
frowns, afraid for Jamie's health.


<b>INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM
</b>
Jamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too
exhausted to carry her weight. Landon picks her up,
gently carries her back to bed. Settles her in.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>          How you doing?

<b>                          JAMIE
</b>                   (murmurs)
          Tired.

Landon sits on her bed. Strokes her hair. They look at
each other. Landon reaches for her hand. When he looks
at her face again, she's asleep.


<b>EXT. LANDON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
Landon's sitting on his childhood tree swing, twisting
side to side. Pensive. His mother comes out of the
house.

</b>             Time seems to be slowing down and
             speeding up at the same time.

She reaches to put a hand on his shoulder.       He lets her.


<b>EXT. CEMETERY - EARLY MARCH
</b>
The rear gate is open. A caretaker waits while Landon
carries pieces of the older telescope to his car. A tall
pile of parts is already at his car.

Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup.    Gravel flying.
<b>MUSIC BLASTING.
</b>

<b>INT. PICKUP
</b>
Eric and Clay spy Landon.


<b>EXT. CEMETERY
</b>
Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.


<b>EXT. PICKUP
</b>
The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops. The
MUSIC QUIETS. Eric and Clay jump down. A long tense
moment, then:

<b>                           ERIC
</b>             Hey.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             Hey.

Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest
telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup.
Eric follows suit.


<b>EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - LATER
</b>
Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how
they fit together. They are like a map for how to build
the bigger one.


<b>EXT. PARSONAGE DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY
</b>
Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard
concrete form-tube from his car. Carries it around the
house toward the back yard.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         103.

<b>INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
Jamie wakes from a nap. She looks thinner, grayer. She
hears HAMMERING. She hauls herself up and to a window.


<b>JAMIE'S POV
</b>
Landon working on the new telescope.    He looks up at her
window. Sees her there. Smiles.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Reverend Sullivan comes in to check on Jamie.    She's
standing at the window.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          What's that boy doing?

She turns to look at him and collapses into his arms.


<b>INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Jamie lies in bed, eyes closed. Hooked to monitors,
pumps, an IV drip. Landon holding her hand. Reverend
Sullivan talks quietly with a doctor. Hearing bad news.


<b>EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN
</b>
The sky is pink. A squirrel runs along a telephone wire.
The Yugo is the only car in the visitor lot.


<b>INT. PATIENT ROOM
</b>
Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly. Jamie
moves and he starts, fully awake. She opens her eyes.

<b>                        LANDON
</b>          You okay?

She nods. Sleepy. Closes her eyes again. He rests his
head on her shoulder and weeps. Her eyes open, then close
again. There's nothing to say.


<b>INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JAMIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
Reverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at
the scene within. He hesitates, then pushes the door
open.

Reverend Sullivan enters.

<b>                         REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          Landon.   You go on home.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>          I'm not tired.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          I need to be with her.

There's only one chair.    Landon nods and goes.

The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment.   When he
opens them, she's looking at him.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>          Dad.

He kisses her forehead, then sits back.

<b>                           JAMIE
</b>          So serious.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          Jamie, God is not punishing you.
          No God I know wants anyone to be
          sick or feel pain or suffer.

Pause.

<b>                        JAMIE
</b>          When Mom died you told me God
          wanted her more, loved her more --

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          I was wrong. Nobody could have
          wanted or loved your mother more
          than we did. Not even God.

He lets this sink in.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          God loaned you to me, entrusted
          you to my care. I'm failing you.

She looks away, agreeing without saying so.

<b>                        REV. SULLIVAN
</b>          Jamie. I make you the same
          promise that God does.

She sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around
her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never
wanting to let him go. Her father.


<b>EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH SCHOOL - HOUR LATER

On the marquee on the front lawn: "WELCOME HALEY'S

<b>INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

Landon picks up a pile of books and assignments.
Looks through them, then eyes Miss Tarbox.

<b>                           LANDON

Landon nods his appreciation.


<b>INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

Jamie looks smaller. Her eyes have blue circles beneath.
The Hemingway novel on the bedstand. Belinda pushes the
door open. Peeks in. Not sure she is welcome.

Landon is sitting in a chair.     He sees her, motions for
her to come in. Quietly.

She hands Landon a small photo album.

window, looks out.


<b>SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER

The sky is grayer, darker.      Landon is still at the window.
Jamie wakes.

<b>                             JAMIE

             It's got quotes from famous

Jamie's breathing is shallower. Landon's reading her The
Sheltering Sky. He pauses, looks up. Isabel, Jamie's
student, is standing in the doorway. Jamie sees her too.
She smiles weakly.

Isabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes
it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling
but reading. Jamie grins.

Isabel looks shyly at Landon. Jamie shakes her head,

Landon is listening.

He holds out a check.   For a lot of money.   Landon takes
it. Grateful.

Clay hands her an envelope.

She pulls out a stack of worn bills.

</b>             I don't mean about Jamie being

"For Landon" above some underlined text, a Psalm from the

Landon knows Jamie underlined this for him.

Landon tears down the steps. Past his mother to the front
door. He's out the door before she even turns around.


<b>INT. PARSONAGE - REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

inside. Leaving the porch light on. Landon goes back to
work.


<b>EXT. BACK YARD - MINUTES LATER

Reverend Sullivan comes out. Dressed. He carries two
mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp
lantern. Peace offerings.

door.

Jamie opens her eyes. But can barely keep them open.
Groggy from pain medication. Landon's standing there.

Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The
finished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky.
She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.

around them.

He checks his watch.

Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and
she peers into the telescope eyepiece. She pulls back,
wipes her eyes, then looks again. She swings the
telescope into the correct position.


<b>HER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE
</b>
Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and
streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's
hazy head and long tail.

<b>                         JAMIE (O.S.)

She steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then
moves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely
engrossed. A long, quiet moment, then:

<b>                           LANDON
</b>           You love me?

She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.

</b>           Will you do something for me?

<b>                           JAMIE

His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear,
sadness, and love.

kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda;
teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel
and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation;
Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids;
neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses.

Landon stands with his father by the altar.

The "WEDDING MARCH" begins...

The double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone
turns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness.


<b>LANDON'S POV - JAMIE
</b>
Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing
her Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but
still becomes her. She's a beautiful bride.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Landon swells with pride.

Jamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly
makes her way down the aisle.

In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.

Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath.     A
moment later, she and her father continue.

A long, difficult walk.    A walk to remember.


<b>AT ALTAR
</b>
The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father
near.

Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.

Jamie sits.   Exhausted.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair.

Pause.   Dr. Carter kneels.   Showing solidarity with his
son.

Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's
cheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check.


<b>LANDON AND JAMIE'S POV
</b>
Reverend Sullivan towering over them.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Reverend Sullivan kneels, too.

Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's
hand in her left. Linking the three together.

The congregation silences.

Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible.     Struggling.

<b>                            REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             As a father, I'm supposed to give
             away my daughter. But I can no
             more give Jamie away than I can
             give away my heart. But I can let
             another share in the joy she has
             given me. May God's blessings be
             with you both.

He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon.     Completing the
circle.

<b>                           REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             Landon, repeat after me. Do you
             take...

As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the
CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar --
Jamie, Landon, Dr. Carter.

TO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter,
Josh, Eric, Clay.

Then BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a
passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her. His
voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own
work.

<b>                           REV. SULLIVAN (O.S.)
</b>             'Love is always patient and kind.
             It is never jealous. Love is
             never boastful or conceited. It
             is never rude or selfish. It does
             not take offense and is not
             resentful. Love takes no pleasure
             in other people's sins, but
             delights in the truth. It is
             always ready to excuse, to trust,
             to hope, and to endure whatever
             comes...'

And the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find...


<b>PARSONAGE
</b>
in a different season.      Winter.

UP the front steps and INTO...


<b>LIVING ROOM (PRESENT DAY)
</b>
As it is now, in present day.

The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting.
Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The
Rainmaker...

The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in.
Reverend Sullivan. He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin
parchment thin.

The two men embrace.       Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.

<b>                           REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             You've been well?

<b>                             LANDON
</b>             Yes.   You?

<b>                             REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             Getting by.

Pause.   Why is he here?     The Reverend waits.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>                    (fumbling)
             I'm -- I'm returning something.

He twists the ring on his finger.      Removes it.

<b>                           LANDON

He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend.          Pause.   Landon
searches for something meaningful to say.

<b>                            LANDON
</b>             She taught me -- everything.     She
             saved my life.

The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness.         Realizing
now why Landon has come.

<b>                           REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             You're marrying again.

<b>                             LANDON
</b>             Yes.

<b>                           REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             Jamie wanted that. She told me.

Landon is grateful to know this.       He makes a move to go.
Then turns back.

<b>                           LANDON
</b>             I'm sorry she never got her
             miracle.

<b>                             REV. SULLIVAN
</b>             She did.    It was you.

Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again.
Warmly, fully. Two men still grieving, saying good-bye.

<b>                           ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>             Jamie once said when you're
             feeling love, you're also feeling
             God.


<b>EXT. NEUSE RIVER - THAT AFTERNOON
</b>
Landon walks alone.      His hair and clothing tousled by a
steady gentle wind.

<b>                           ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
</b>             She made me a believer. In love.
             In life. In the journey that
             never ends...

Landon stops.       Faces the wind.   Lets the air swirl over
him.

He closes his eyes.    She's there...
