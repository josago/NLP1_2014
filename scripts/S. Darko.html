</b>          SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer
          sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly,
          looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless
          wheat field.

</b>          Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her
          shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite
          golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in
          the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...

          finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.

          contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and

          WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly

          phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which
          objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions,
          and move according to a framework of set paths.
<b>          
</b>          A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic

<b>          
</b>          It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She
          has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is
          cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.

          TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees
          Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30
          feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of
          his ski mask...

          which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,
          CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his
          arms...
<b>

          what is sitting right beside him --

          circle around his chest.
<b>          
</b>          Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that
          release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...
<b>          
</b>          Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE
          FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the
          clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his
          hand remains glued to the spot.
<b>          
</b>          Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to
          Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of
          herself.
<b>          
</b>          The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to
          shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the
<b>          COSMOS:

<b>          
</b>          A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling
          like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and
          Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF

</b><b>          
</b>          The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from
          early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER
          and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL,
          and a few people swim in the greenish water.
<b>          
</b>          Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so
          Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam
          hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.

                    you the VIP treatment, man...
<b>          
</b>          Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.

</b><b>                              SAM
</b>                    Yeah. Definitely.
<b>          
</b>          Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam
          appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her
          cup for some liquid courage.
<b>          
</b>          Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer
          O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth
          notices him first.

                    a cop, but he still likes to party.
<b>          
</b>          Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his
          pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE
          GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied.

          the pool and splashes them.

</b>          Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth
          watches her, smirking.

</b><b>                              RANDY

<b>          
</b>          Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --

</b><b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER
</b><b>

          DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.
<b>          
</b>          Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS
          glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO:

          can been seen...
<b>          
</b>          In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11)
          and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their
          dance performance... BACK TO:
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls
          her up --
<b>          
</b>          She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath --
          back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible
          for pulling her out.
<b>          
</b><b>                              RANDY

<b>          
</b>          He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
          Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...
<b>          
</b>          She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and
          jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in
          approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in
          right behind her.
<b>          
</b>          Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps
          are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's
          surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHRIS
</b>                    Thought you could maybe use this.
<b>          
</b>          As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the
          inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam
          wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.
<b>

          no one else is in sight.

</b><b>          
</b>          Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A
          lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an
          orange glow.
<b>          
</b>          She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and
          JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right
          hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her
          forehead...
<b>          
</b>          A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing
          her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front
          of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.

</b><b>          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS
</b><b>          
</b>          Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex,
          phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR
          SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements
          as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON,
          and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.
<b>

</b>          Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam

          but she doesn't flinch...
<b>          
</b>          She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side
          of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone
          who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a
          DITCH near a CULVERT --

<b>          
</b>          A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the
          circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the
          phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong
          enough to make them falter.
<b>          
</b>          On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT

</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over
          them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS
          and approach the great WOOD DOORS...
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past
          her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...
<b>          
</b>          Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of
          Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.
<b>          
</b>          Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right,
          where two walls and the ceiling meet...
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT
</b><b>          
</b>          The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with
          the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING
<b>          SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.
</b><b>          
</b>          PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines,
          with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.
<b>          
</b>          A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he
          stands below it, reaching higher and higher...
<b>          
</b>          As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the
          BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes
          start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS
</b><b>          
</b>          Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and
          outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  26.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has
          enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger...
<b>          
</b>          COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE
<b>          FLAME...
</b><b>          
</b>          Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and
<b>          SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          OVER WHITE...
</b><b>          
</b>          The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present
          again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING...
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face.
          She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the
          beds.
<b>          
</b>          She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES
          are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...
<b>          
</b><b>          BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
</b><b>          
</b>          She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...

</b><b>          I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to
          find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.
<b>          
</b><b>                              PHIL

</b><b>          EXT. BANK - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall SIGN with
          the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. It strikes
          a chord but she doesn't know why...
<b>          
</b>          The sign reads 12:48 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20, 1995. It
          changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN: 14 DAYS, 8 HOURS, 11

</b>          Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter
          she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears. Some of her FEMALE CO-

<b>          
</b>          Trudy looks up and sees Sam waiting uncomfortably.

</b>                    It's no secret to me how people in
                    this town feel about Father
                    Homeijer. The horrible accusations
                    that have been made against him...
                    But it's just a lot of nonsense. El
                    Reno's changed so much since I was
                    a kid growing up here. The young

                    crime... I just don't know what

                    You could always use Western Union.

                    have a signature.

<b>          
</b>          She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's
          dark, empty eyes. Though it's just a low quality black &

          despair.

                    by an arrow that nobody shot, and a
                    swordsmith getting killed by a
                    sword he hadn't made yet.
                    Unexplainable things, but it says
                    there's a reason why they happen.

</b>          RANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a
          VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen. SPARSE
          LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.
<b>          
</b>          There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most
          containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.

</b>          Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the
          other cars but still with a nice view.

</b>          Mike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living
          room, watching BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD on MTV. Some EMPTY BEER
          CANS and a HOMEADE BONG litter a coffee table. When the FRONT
          DOOR OPENS and Corey and Randy enter, none of them budge.

</b>          Randy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from
          the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above
          it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS,
          POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.
<b>          
</b>          A large BLACK & WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE   UP of COBAIN'S
          FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET   HOLE drawn in
          RED MARKER marks the center of his forehead.   The words `I'M
          NOT AFRAID OF DYING' are scrawled across the   bottom of the
          poster in the same BRIGHT RED.

          SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to
          01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.
<b>          
</b>          Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks
          around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep
          by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside
          the bed and grabs her shirt...
<b>

</b>          As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery,
          liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.
<b>          
</b>          Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room,
          elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...

          sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path
          leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...
<b>          
</b>          Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as
          she treads out the door...

          about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is
          guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.
<b>          
</b>          The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in
          space-time materializes.
<b>          
</b>          There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF
          THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,
          swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-
          dimensional realm of darkest night.

          WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.
<b>          
</b>          Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already
          been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on
          the floor.
<b>

</b>          Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The
          pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up
          from the sink drain, also in the shower...
<b>          
</b>          Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually
          morose expression transforms into a smile.

</b>          The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares
          into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --

          through her closet until she finds a SHOEBOX.

          flushes it. The WHITE POWDER disappears down the swirling

</b>          Sam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's
          car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
          passenger side window.

</b>          Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward
          the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot

          backseat.
<b>          
</b>          She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting

<b>          
</b>          The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the

          from stepping into the street...
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
<b>          
</b>          The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
          skitters harmlessly across the intersection --

          traumatized her.

<b>          
</b>          A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's

          rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.
<b>          
</b>          Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom
          watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go

          on the trigger.
<b>          
</b>          He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE,
          and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate
          system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL

          Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...
<b>          
</b>          The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when
          the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to
          accommodate the penetrating force...
<b>          
</b>          The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but
          then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same
          spot, centimeters from her face --

                    have a percentage of nickel and

</b>          When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things,
          she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it
          up.

</b>          She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and
          jagged teeth...
<b>          
</b>          She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her.
          When she senses his presence she's startled.

</b>                    Sorry...
<b>          
</b>          She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says
          nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her
          there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.
<b>          
</b>          After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise,
          Tom begins to speak:
<b>          
</b><b>                               VIETNAM TOM

<b>          
</b>          Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask.
          Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask...
<b>          
</b>          When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping
          her -- not too rough, but forceful.
<b>          
</b>          Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes
          drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
          Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.
<b>          
</b>          When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with
          emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly
          and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.
