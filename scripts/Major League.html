               Three men in Cleveland Indian baseball caps sit at the 
               counter. BOBBY JAMES, 22-year-old grad student, VIC BOLITO, 
               30-year-old telephone worker, and JOHNNY WYNN, 45-year-old 
               house painter. THELMA GORDON, 65-year-old waitress, delivers 
               their breakfast.

                         this year?

               The other two shake their heads in contemplation of this

               We TILT UP from the field to a glass-enclosed area on the 
               third deck.

</b>
               It's the Cleveland Indians' conference room. Three men are 
               seated around the table; CHARLIE DONOVAN. the manager, PHIL 
               BUTLER, public relations head, JERRY SIMMONS, operations 
               director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel 
               Donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for 
               somebody.

</b>                              (checking his watch)
                         Thirty minutes late. Think she'll 
                         show?

</b>                         She's got to. She's the damn owner 
                         now.

</b>                         She didn't last week. She was having 
                         a guava facial.

               As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the 
               conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE SECRETARY-
               BODYGUARD enters, clearing the way for MRS. RACHEL PHELPS, a 
               flashy, striking woman in her early forties. Despite the 
               designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something 
               less refined about her. She carries a Pekinese dog, CHA-CHA 
               on her left hip.

<b>                                     RACHEL
</b>                         Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to 
                         another season of Indians' baseball.

               The men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. The 
               Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the 
               table and Rachel sits.

<b>                                     RACHEL
</b>                         I know that it may not seem the same 
                         without Donald here this year, but I 
                         promise you by the end of the season 
                         this team will have made history.

               Several eyes roll up around the room.

</b>                              (picking up a newspaper)
                         Unfortunately there are some in the 
                         press who feel that...
                              (reading from the 
                              page)
                         "the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps 
                         has no business being the owner of a 
                         major league baseball team."

               Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away.

</b>                         Obviously, Donald didn't feel that 
                         way or he wouldn't have left the 
                         team to me. And I was more than 
                         showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I 
                         know some of you have doubts about 
                         my ability to run this franchise. 
                         God help you if I ever find out about 
                         it.

               This causes a few nervous glances in the room.

                              paper on the table)
                         Here's the list of people we'll be 
                         inviting to camp this year.

               Donovan, Butler and Simmons pour over the list.

                         great year we're gonna have, but the 
                         facts are we lost the two best players 
                         we had to free agency. We haven't 
                         won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't 
                         even finished in the first division 
                         for 15. Obviously it's time to make 
                         some changes. What do ya think?

</b>                         I never heard of half these guys. 
                         And the ones I do know are way past 
                         their prime.

                         Let's not be hasty.

</b>                         It's time to shake things up, Charlie. 
                         Clear the board and start over.

</b>                         Well, it's not the best material 
                         I've ever had to work with, but I'll 
                         do my best to see we move up a notch 
                         this year.

<b>                                     RACHEL

                         I'm movin' you up to General Manager. 
                         Congratulations.

               Rachel sticks out her hand. Donovan shakes it somewhat feebly, 
               bewildered by this whole development.

<b>                                     RACHEL

                         Thank you, gentlemen. Let's get to 
                         work.

               With that, Rachel gets up and breezes out of the room with 
               her entourage, leaving Donovan and the others dumbfounded.

</b>
               Donovan, carrying a boxful of belongings under each arm, 
               pushes open the door of his new office and walks inside. The 
               basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full 
               of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk 
               accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed. Suddenly, 
               there's a voice at the door.

                         It's no secret I've never liked 
                         Cleveland much. The weather's lousy, 
                         downtown is a pit, the stadium's 
                         falling apart, and we can't draw 
                         dick. Another couple of years of 
                         this and I'm gonna have to start 
                         feeding Cha-Cha dog food.

               Rachel bends down to give her dog, Cha-Cha, a little love 
               pat, while Donovan tries to contain his disgust.

</b>                         It's hardly a whim. Miami's offered 
                         to build us a new stadium -- 62,000 
                         capacity, 45 V.I.P. boxes, and no 
                         rent for the first million at the 
                         gate. Plus a 12 million dollar media 
                         guarantee; 45 percent of the 
                         concession gross, all of the parking 
                         and they pick up the stadium 
                         operations costs. No other franchise 
                         in baseball can match that deal.

               Donovan is stunned. He casts around helplessly for some

               The room is a total mess. The back door is off its hinges 
               and a few chickens have wandered in. As they peck around the 
               debris, we PAN the room, taking in beer cans, food wrappers 
               and finally a trail of hastily discarded clothes, both male 
               and female.

               We reach the bed and find our hero, JAKE TAYLOR, 35, and 
               with a couple days growth of stubble, passed out on his face. 
               Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late 
               twenties. She's not great looking, but at least she's 
               overweight. Taylor's hand fumbles to the RINGING telephone.

                         night. Who's this girl on top of me?

               Donovan is baffled by this whole line of conversation.

               Taylor hangs up, leaving Donovan staring into his phone.

               Taylor sits in the back seat. He has six Coke bottles filled

               Donovan, Brown and two of his coaches, PEPPER LEACH (pitching) 
               and DUKE TEMPLE (hitting) are on the field, witnessing the 
               arrival of their "troops." First to arrive is:

               He gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats 
               and luggage.

<b>               INT. PLAYER'S BARRACKS - DAY

               Like an Army barracks. Rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers. 
               Taylor walks in with Temple, the hitting instructor.

               back at the field, supervising the arrival of more players.

               The first is a tall, muscular Latin, PEDRO CERRANO, dressed 
               in black from head to toe. He arrives on foot, carrying a 
               black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels. He 
               looks like a gunfighter coming into Dodge.

                         only high-priced. Got him as a free

               Dorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car.

               a 22-year-old black, pulling up in a '72 VW Beetle which 
               he's got a Cadillac grille on. He steps out in his shades

               Hayes hustles off toward his car.

</b>                         I don't remember a Hayes on the list.

               A motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot, diverting everyone's 
               attention from Hayes.

               Off steps Ricky Vaughn, a hefty bag over his shoulder. He's 
               still sporting his radical do.

</b>                         Maybe he's the mascot.

               Donovan is speechless. Brown breaks into a small smile. Yes, 
               sir, this is his kinda team.

<b>               INT. PLAYERS' BARRACKS
</b>
               Taylor is putting his stuff away in a locker. Vaughn enters 
               the barracks and immediately draws the attention of Dorn.

<b>                                     DORN
</b>                         Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks 
                         like a fuckin' toilet brush. Hey, 
                         T.B., I love your pony tail. And the 
                         earring's cute too. Where's the 
                         matching bracelet?

               Vaughn whips a hard glance at Dorn, but keeps on walking, 
               making his way along the bunks looking for his assigned bed. 
               It's the one above Taylor. Vaughn unloads his duffel bag in 
               silence.

               Vaughn shakes it and nods. Says nothing.

</b>                         So, you just gonna settle for toilet 
                         brush, or you got another name?

</b>                         Forget about Dorn. He's always a 
                         little tough on rookies. You'll get 
                         a lot worse from other teams.

               The conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Hayes.

               Hayes doesn't quite know what to make of Vaughn.

               The players are dressing out in their uniforms for the first 
               day of practice. Vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a 
               slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his 
               pigtail. Suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of

                         that talent isn't everything. They'd 
                         rather see desire and discipline in 
                         a player. Then they tell you that

               Hayes' cot is sitting in the lot, just outside the fence, 
               his suitcase set down next to it. Hayes is still asleep, dew 
               on his forehead. Wakened by the noise of activity on the 
               field, he sits up with a start.

               We pick up Taylor sprinting his ass off in a 100-yard time 
               trial, staggering across the finish line 10 feet behind 
               Cerrano.

                         11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen 
                         down.

               As Taylor tries to catch his breath, Dorn and a relief pitcher 
               named Gant approach the starting line for the next trial.

               Dorn and Gentry take off.

               Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking 
               toward the starting line in hot pursuit. Dorn and Gentry a 
               good 10-yard lead, but Hayes is coming like a bullet. We go 
               to SLOW MOTION as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and 
               blasts on by to win by five. This kid is fast. Brown and 
               Pepper give each other the "Who was that Masked Man" look.

               disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano, who are doing them like 
               pistons in competition with each other. Cerrano even starts 
               doing them one-handed.

               Hayes isn't doing them at all; merely pulling his head up 
               and down while leaving his body on the ground.

<b>               EXT. BATTING CAGE - DAY
</b>
               Brown is watching batting practice.

               Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual 
               worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching, 
               knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc. A real 
               slugger's routine.

</b>                         C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All 
                         Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.

               Hayes gets in and takes his stance. On the first pitch, he 
               takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher's mound. 
               We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches. Hayes takes 
               prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop-
               ups, none out of the infield. Brown calls a halt.

               The next pitch comes in. Hayes swings and pops it up.

               Brown and Pepper stand behind Taylor for a better view. Vaughn 
               goes into his wind-up and fires a screaming fast ball that 
               Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch. The 
               ball rockets an inch over Brown's head, and slams into the 
               backstop.

               Brown stands frozen a second, contemplating his brush with 
               eternity, then turns to Pepper.

               Brown strikes an effeminate fielding position, like Betty

               Harris winds and throws a fair-to-middlin' curve ball. Cerrano

               Cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to 
               the fetish doll. Harris has been listening to all this. 
               Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers.

                         Is very bad.

               Cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving

               compressing and detailing the progress of spring training. 
               We see:

               A) Vaughn on the pitcher's mound. A tin replica of a batter 
               has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the 
               plate to delineate the strike zone. Vaughn fires a pitch and 
               hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him.

               B) Cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at 
               several curve balls.

<b>               C) HAYES
</b>
               doing push-ups at night. He's the only one left on the field, 
               except Temple, who supervises.

<b>               D) TAYLOR
</b>
               doing the "scramble" drill -- blocking down balls purposely 
               thrown in the dirt, one after another. When it ends, he can 
               hardly get to his feet.

<b>               E) CERRANO
</b>
               waving a ten-foot BOA CONSTRICTOR in the sign of the cross 
               in front of his locker before opening it. No red tag greets 
               him. Hayes watches from a safe distance.

<b>               F) VAUGHN
</b>
               holding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a 
               peek inside to see if there's a red tag there.

<b>               G) DORN
</b>
               taking a hard ground ball off the chest. Brown applauds. 
               Dorn is pissed.

<b>               H) VAUGHN
</b>
               throwing at the "ropes" again. The tin batter is dented in 
               every conceivable place now. Vaughn whips in another fast 
               ball. This one hits the tin man in the head, knocking it 
               completely off.

<b>               I) TAYLOR
</b>
               in an exhibition game, attempting to throw out a base stealer. 
               Jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second -- 
               on a bounce. The ball skips into center field.

<b>               J) HAYES
</b>
               also in an exhibition game, swinging at a pitch and popping 
               it up behind the plate. He just drops in his tracks and starts 
               to do push-ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him.

<b>               K) CERRANO
</b>
               flailing away again at a curve ball. This and the remaining 
               shots are all in exhibition games.

<b>               L) HAYES
</b>
               waving a ten-inch garter snake in front of his locker. Even 
               at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but 
               it works its magic. No red tag.

<b>               M) VAUGHN
</b>
               with a runner on third, winding up and throwing a pitch four 
               feet over Taylor's head. The run scores.

<b>               N) HAYES
</b>
               attempting to steal second. He goes into a hell-bent-for-
               leather head first slide. Unfortunately, he comes up two 
               feet short of the base. The second baseman, who's waiting 
               for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming. 
               Hayes flips him the bird.

<b>               O) LOU BROWN
</b>
               on the bench. He turns to Pepper with a look that says, "Can 
               you believe this shit?"

<b>               P) TAYLOR
</b>
               waiting for a throw at the plate. Just as he's about to catch 
               it, the runner knocks him flat.

<b>               Q) BROWN
</b>
               his head in his hands. As Taylor gets up and goes to the 
               wrong dugout, the MONTAGE ENDS.

               Players are filing off the team bus after the game. We PICK 
               UP Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn as they head toward the locker 
               room.

</b>                         No, I'm goin' cold turkey today. My 
                         hands are too screwed up to hold it 
                         anyway.

               Hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands.

                         skin left on your hands.

               They've reached the locker room now.

</b>                         What if we're one of the deceased?

               Taylor goes into the locker room. Hayes and Vaughn hang back.

               Cerrano is already at his locker. He's got two snakes this 
               time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. He sprays a patch 
               of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a 
               symbol door. No tag. He kisses the snake, leaving some white 
               paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk.

               Taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers 
               inside. He's made it, too. Cerrano offers a hand. Taylor 
               shakes it and breaks a weary smile.

               opens locker, slumps on stool. He's a goner.

<b>               HAYES AND VAUGHN
</b>
               the two rookies, are still hanging back.

<b>                                     HAYES
</b>                         C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts 
                         here. If they cut us, we'll just 
                         sign with the Yankees.

               Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. This 
               doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes 
               closed. He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one 
               eye.

               Seeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the 
               locker room, as if he had to get to the john.

               He comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around 
               like a wild man.

<b>               VAUGHN
</b>
               drawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker 
               and whips it open. There hanging from the top hook is the 
               "red death." Vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly 
               closes his locker.

               We GO TO Vaughn, his faced a mask of anger and embarrassment.

<b>               THE LOCKER ROOM AGAIN

               Vaughn charges across the room and jumps Dorn. The men grapple 
               and fight all over the room, until Taylor finally gets them 
               separated.

<b>                                     DORN

                         What's the matter, little lady? Can't 
                         you take a joke?

               Vaughn gives Dorn a look that indicates this isn't over. Lou 
               Brown enters the room.

<b>                                     BROWN
</b>                         Can I have your attention, please? I 
                         counted up your ballots for team 
                         captain and I think you chose the

                         the year -- Jake Taylor.

               The team breaks into applause and whistles as Taylor's name 
               is announced. Dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about 
               it. As Taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates, 
               he turns to Vaughn.

<b>                                     TAYLOR

               Taylor gives him a wide smile. Vaughn finally allows himself 
               one.

               Taylor is alone in the stadium, standing near home plate in 
               his street clothes, taking in the massive stadium, remembering 
               glories past. He steps into the batter's box and takes his 
               stance.

                         Two down. Bottom of the ninth.

               Taylor points to the left field stands. He imagines a pitch 
               coming in, takes a mighty swing and admires the flight of 
               the imaginary ball as it arches high in the mid-day sky, 
               landing deep in the left field seats. Breaking into his home 
               run trot, he circles the bases, slapping the third base 
               coach's hand and exchanging low fives with his teamates as 
               he reaches the plate.

               Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause. 
               He turns and looks in the dugout, where Hayes and Vaughn are 
               giving him a hand.

               The glasses CLINK. Suddenly Taylor's attention fixes on 
               something across the room -- a stunning young woman in her 
               late twenties, LYNN WESTLAND. She's having dinner with a 
               DATE in a three-piece suit.

               Hayes and Vaughn follow Taylor's eyes to the woman.

               Sensing that something's askew, she turns and looks across 
               the way to see Jake talking to her on the pay phone on the

               We get our fist glimpse of HARRY DOYLE, the Indians' 55-year-
               old radio announcer. Harry's never walked past a bar in anger. 
               He's been with the Indians through thin and thinner.

                         Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle here, 
                         welcoming all you Friends of the 
                         Feather to another season of Indians 
                         baseball.
                              (pouring some Jack 
                              Daniels in his Coke)
                         A lotta new faces for the tribe this 
                         year, as they take on the defending 
                         American League champs, the New York 
                         Yankees. And listen to the roar of 
                         the crowd as the Indians takes the 
                         field!

               Doyle leans out the press box window with his mike, trying 
               to pick up the sound of a couple guys CLAPPING down below.

<b>                                     DOYLE
</b>                         Yes, sir, they love this club here 
                         in Cleveland.

               Doyle takes a hit of his spiked Coke.

<b>               DOWN ON THE FIELD
</b>
<b>               A YANKEE HITTER
</b>
               flies out to Hayes, who makes a "basket" catch a la Willie 
               Mays.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         High fly ball, centerfield. Hayes 
                         under it now... Oh, makes a basket 
                         catch, Willie Mays style, and the 
                         side is retired.

<b>               THE INDIAN DUGOUT
</b>
               The team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back-
               slapping.

<b>                                     BROWN
</b>                         All right, way to look, way to look. 
                         Nice catch, Hayes. Don't ever fuckin' 
                         do it again. Okay, let's get it goin'!

<b>               DOYLE IN THE PRESS BOX
</b>
<b>                                     DOYLE
</b>                         Bottom of the first, Willie Mays 
                         Hayes to lead it off for the tribe.

<b>               HAYES
</b>
               going through his warmup routine at the plate.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         A lotta people say you can tell how 
                         a season's gonna go by the first 
                         hitter of the year. In the last 
                         fifteen years, the Indians have never 
                         had the season lead-off hitter reach 
                         base.

               Hayes is in the batter's box now. The Yankee pitcher winds 
               and fires. Hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward 
               the second baseman, who races in and scoops it up bare-handed.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         Hot shot toward the hole. Rudia knocks 
                         it down, gets up, fires to first. 
                         Too late! Hayes beats it!

               Doyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some 
               cheering.

<b>                                     DOYLE
</b>                         And so the string is broken. Maybe 
                         things will turn around a little for 
                         the Indians this year.

<b>               THE BLEACHERS
</b>
               Our four fans (from here on known as the Bleacher Band), 
               overjoyed by Hayes' hit, start beating the tom-toms and 
               singing a fight song they've composed called "In the Land Of 
               Burning Waters" to the tune of the old Hamms Beer jingle.

</b>                         In the land of burning waters, waters

                         Love those mighty Redmen, Turn their 
                         foes to dead men, Ummmmm.

<b>               FIRST BASE AREA
</b>
               as Hayes comes back to the bag, where the Yankee FIRST BASEMAN 
               is waiting for him.

<b>                                     FIRST BASEMAN
</b>                         Showed some real power on that one, 
                         Slugger.

<b>                                     HAYES
</b>                         I plan to get at least a double out 
                         of it.

               Hayes reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of the 
               pairs of black leather gloves he bought earlier.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         And now Hayes is putting on a pair 
                         of black gloves, sending a little 
                         message to the Yankees.

<b>                                     HAYES
</b>                              (to the First Baseman)
                         Bought a hundred of these, one for 
                         each base I plan to steal. Excuse 
                         me, here, I gotta take my first step 
                         toward the Hall of Fame.

               Hayes takes his lead-off and crouches, ready to steal.

<b>                                     FIRST BASEMAN
</b>                         You look real sharp, but you'll never 
                         steal second with your shoe untied.

               Hayes looks down at his shoe. It's not untied. He notices 
               too late that the PITCHER is throwing over to pick him off.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         Brewster, quick move to first...

               Hayes dives back for the bag, but never gets there; his face 
               smashing up against the First Baseman's glove, which is 
               already holding the ball.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         He got him. Hayes is picked off.

<b>                                     FIRST BASEMAN
</b>                         Nice base running, dildo. Hard to 
                         get your thumb out of your ass with 
                         the gloves on.

               Hayes lies in the dust humiliated.

<b>                                     DOYLE
</b>                         Well, so much for that.

               Doyle takes a long pull on his Coke and we GO INTO A MONTAGE 
               depicting the Indians' progressive disintegration in this 
               game. We see:

               A) THREE FIELDERS converging on a short pop fly into left 
               field. They all collide and go down in a heap as the ball 
               drops untouched.

               B) DORN playing a grounder off his hip. He fumbles it, picks 
               it up, fumbles it again. No play.

               C) TAYLOR crouched behind the plate, but up off his haunches, 
               ready to throw. We hear the voice of his thoughts.

<b>                                     TAYLOR'S VOICE
</b>                         Guy's goin'. Gotta be goin'... get 
                         the throw up. Don't bounce the damn 
                         ball.

               The runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in. Taylor 
               catches the ball and fires down to second. The ball sails 
               three feet over the second baseman's head and on into center 
               field. Taylor stands there, disgusted.

<b>                                     TAYLOR'S VOICE
</b>                         Nice throw, dickhead.

               D) CERRANO striking out on a curve ball. He bawls his bat 
               out on the way to the dugout.

               E) THE THREE FIELDERS we saw before, converging on another 
               pop fly into short left. This time all three dive off at the 
               last instant to avoid a collision. Once again the ball drops 
               untouched.

<b>               END MONTAGE.
</b>
<b>               THE SCOREBOARD
</b>
               It shows Yankees 4, Indians 0 after five innings.

<b>               DOYLE UP IN THE BOOTH
</b>
               There are two empty Coca-Cola cups near the mike. He's working 
               on a third.

<b>                                     DOYLE
</b>                         Top of the sixth. Rookie sensation, 
                         Ricky Vaughn, on to pitch now. You 
                         can close the book on Winters...

               Vaughn stands on the mound rubbing up the baseball with the 
               same intensity we saw in the locker room.

<b>                                     TAYLOR
</b>                         Easy does it, Ricky. We're only four 
                         down. We're still in this thing.

<b>                                     PEPPER
</b>                         Don't worry if you're off the plate 
                         on a few pitches. Doesn't hurt to 
                         put the fear of God in a hitter.

               Vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as Pepper and 
               Taylor leave. The Yankee Hitter steps in.

               Vaughn winds and fires a screamer. Taylor has to leap high 
               to come down with it.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         First pitch is a little high...

               The Yankee Hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch.

<b>                                     YANKEE HITTER
</b>                         This guy kinda wild?

<b>                                     TAYLOR
</b>                         I figure you got a 30% chance to 
                         survive this at bat.

               ANOTHER PITCH to the Yankee hitter. It's outside.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         Ball four.

               ANOTHER PITCH to a SECOND YANKEE HITTER. It's low.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         Ball eight.

               ANOTHER PITCH to a THIRD YANKEE HITTER. He has to jump over 
               it.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         Low, and Vaughn has walked the bases 
                         loaded on twelve straight pitches. 
                         By the laws of probability, you'd 
                         think one of those coulda drifted 
                         over the plate.

<b>               THE BLEACHER BAND
</b>
               Bobby gives the downbeat and, in honor of Vaughn, the three 
               men stand to pound out a version of "Wild Thing" on the tom-
               toms. Bobby does the vocal.

<b>                                     BOBBY
</b>                         Wild thing, You make my heart sing, 
                         You walk everything.

               Pepper has reached the mound...

<b>                                     PEPPER
</b>                         Okay kid. I think we got 'em scared 
                         enough now. Time to get a few of 'em 
                         out.

               Vaughn nods. He's plenty upset with himself.

<b>                                     PEPPER
</b>                         Just relax, and keep the arm up on 
                         top. Gotta throw strikes. No place 
                         at the inn for this guy.

               He gives Vaughn a pat on the butt, and goes back to the 
               dugout.

               The Yankee hitter, HAYWOOD, stands in. He's the first baseman 
               who tagged Hayes out.

<b>                                     HAYWOOD
</b>                         Hey, Taylor, what you doin' back up 
                         here?

<b>                                     TAYLOR
</b>                         Couldn't cut it in the Mexican League.

               Vaughn, determined to throw a strike, winds and delivers. 
               The ball is a perfect strike, right down the middle.

               Haywood crushes it to deep left field. Vaughn drops his head, 
               not even bothering to look.

<b>                                     VAUGHN
</b>                         Oh, shit...

               The ball lands in the second deck; a grand slam home run.

<b>                                     PEPPER
</b>                              (to Brown)
                         Looked like a strike anyway. You 
                         want me to go get him?

<b>                                     BROWN
</b>                         No, let's see how he reacts.

               Vaughn paces around on the mound, rubbing up the ball. The 
               next hitter, COLEMAN, steps in. Vaughn gets up on the rubber, 
               his face set. He winds up and fires one right into Coleman's 
               back. Coleman goes down in a hurry.

<b>                                     BROWN
</b>                         Interesting.

<b>                                     PEPPER
</b>                         At least he hit what he was aimin' 
                         at.

<b>                                     BROWN
</b>                         I think you can go get him now.

               Both benches are up on the dugout steps ready to come out. 
               The only thing holding them back is that Coleman is being 
               tended to by the trainer.

               The home plate umpire thumbs Vaughn out of the game. Vaughn 
               comes down to protest, but Pepper quickly grabs him and 
               hurries him off the field.

<b>                                     PEPPER
</b>                         C'mon, kid. As soon as Coleman gets 
                         up, he's gonna be lookin' for you.

               looks around for Vaughn, but he's already disappeared into 
               the dugout. Coleman walks down to first under his own power.

               Brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides

               Taylor sits in his car, across the street from the employee 
               entrance of the library. He scrunches down a bit as Lynn 
               comes out of the building and heads for her car. She gets in 
               and we...

               driving through the city with Taylor following at a discrete 
               distance. Finally, Lynn pulls up outside an expensive-looking 
               townhouse. Taylor pulls up further down the street and watches 
               her go inside, debating whether to go in after her.

<b>               INT. CLEVELAND BAR - EARLY EVENING

               Taylor's having a beer, still trying to decide whether to go 
               see her or not.

</b>
               pulling up outside the townhouse he saw Lynn go into. He 
               goes up the stairs and knocks on the door.

               Lynn answers, looking more dressed up than when she left the 
               library. She's surprised to see Taylor.

               Before Lynn can answer, Tom appears at the door.

               Before Taylor can beg off further, Tom ushers him inside and 
               closes the door. In the room are two other couples: ARTHUR 
               HOLLOWAY, a senior partner in Tom's firm and his wife CLAIRE, 
               and BRENT BOWDEN, another lawyer in the firm and a 
               contemporary of Tom's. His wife is JANICE. This is a very 
               upscale group.

               Polite nods from the group, except for Janice, who seems 
               somewhat intrigued.

                         wanted to discuss with Lynn. I thought

                         Congratulations.

               Taylor sticks out his hand. Tom's not sure whether Taylor's 
               putting him on or not. He shakes anyway.

                         moving up, eh, Jake?

               Tom clinks his glass with Jake's beer, the slight 
               condescension in his manner not lost on Taylor. Lynn is 
               uncomfortable with this whole situation. Janice moves a bit 
               closer to Taylor. It's obvious she finds him attractive.

               Lynn is irritated by Janice's directness.

</b>                         I make the League minimum.

               Tom and the others react as if Taylor's just announced a 
               death in the family.

                         until he had problems with his knees.

               Everyone is somewhat surprised by Lynn's quick defense of 
               Taylor, including Lynn herself.

               Jack just nods. He never heard of it.

               Vaughn looks at the picture on the wall. He squints slightly. 
               Brown notices it.

               Brown quickly prints some big letters on a legal pad and 
               goes to stand about fifteen feet from Vaughn.

               Vaughn balks a second and then concentrates on the pad, 
               squinting. Unsettled, he squints harder. He even tries closing

               Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are dressing out for 
               the game. Vaughn is wearing his glasses.

               Meanwhile, Cerrano is sharpening a long knife at his locker.

                         to him.

                         murder.

               Cerrano pulls the unborn chicken out of his pocket -- a common 
               store bought egg. Harris is a little embarrassed at his 
               outburst.

               Cerrano touches the egg to his forehead, then places it on 
               his altar. In one swift motion he slams the knife down on 
               it, cutting it into two perfect halves. Taylor and the others 
               are agape at a knife sharp enough to do this. As the yolk 
               spreads out on the altar, Brown emerges from his office.

               The locker room quickly empties, leaving one man behind -- 
               Harris. He looks around to make sure everyone is gone, then 
               tiptoes over to Cerrano's locker. Screwing up his courage, 
               he picks up Jo-Buu's cup of gin.

</b>                         Here's looking at ya, Jo-Buu.

               He bolts it down, then backs into the middle of the room, 
               waiting at the ready, as if half-expecting a bolt of 
               lightning. When nothing happens, he gloats at the fetish 
               doll in triumph.

<b>               HARRIS
</b>
               strutting out of the dugout, feeling like a million bucks. 
               As he emerges onto the field, a Hitter in the batting cage 
               swings and misses, the bat slipping out of his hands. Away 
               it flies, whirling off down the third base line in a wide 
               arc. It hits Harris in the back of the head and knocks him 
               cold.

               Vaughn, wearing his new glasses, paces the mound nervously. 
               He goes to the rosin bag, wipes his brow, shakes out his 
               arm. Finally up on the rubber, he gets the sign from Taylor, 
               goes to his stretch, checks the runner and fires to the plate.

<b>               THE OAKLAND BATTER
</b>
               swings and hits a grounder between third and short. Dorn 
               moves to his left, but the ball goes past his glove and into 
               left field. There is some question as to whether Dorn really 
               gave it a full effort.

                         at the corners.

               Vaughn stomps around on the mound, obviously upset. He glares 
               at Dorn a beat before getting back on the mound. Dorn's face 
               is non-commital. Brown paces in the dugout.

               The next Oakland hitter, steps in. Taylor flashes a sign. 
               Vaughn comes to the stretch and delivers. High, ball one. 
               The runner on first goes down to second without a throw, the 
               pitch being too tough to handle.

                         winning run is in scoring position.

               Taylor walks out in front of the plate to throw the ball 
               back to Vaughn.

               Taylor goes back behind the dish. Vaughn gets up on the 
               rubber. He winds and comes to the plate. Way high this time.

               has gone out to the mound.

               Vaughn permits himself a little smile and release from the

               Dorn looks at Taylor for some sign that he's kidding. He 
               doesn't get one.

               Taylor turns and walks on out, as we go to Dorn's stunned

               approaches the whirlpool and turns on the water.

               Brown flips on a switch. The whirlpool makes some grinding 
               noises and then quits altogether.

               the heave-ho thumb just as Brown arrives. Wingo turns away.

               to the hilt, he throws his glove and mask to the ground on 
               the way.

               Meanwhile, Brown is going jaw to jaw with Wingo, outraged at 
               the call. Brown pulls a carrot out of his back pocket, and 
               offers it to Wingo, who immediately thumbs him out.

               leaving her seat and starting up the aisle.

               Taylor comes up the stairs from the locker room, still in 
               full uniform. He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn 
               disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot.

               in the parking lot. As she goes to unlock her car, Taylor 
               looks around hurriedly for some kind of vehicle to follow 
               her in.

               He bangs on the bullpen gates and is admitted by the guard.

               Inside is the Bullpen car, a souped-up golf cart with a body 
               shaped like a batting helmet. Taylor hops in and roars out 
               after Lynn.

<b>               INT. CLEVELAND ATHLETIC CLUB - NIGHT

               Lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area, 
               deserted this time of night. She wears a racing suit, but 
               lets her hair hang free. The pool glows like a sheet of 
               emerald glass. She shakes down a beat, curls her toes around 
               the coping, slowly bends at the waist, and then launches 
               into a full-out racing dive.

               We watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley; first 
               the butterfly, then the backstroke, breaststroke and finally 
               freestyle. We condense the time, of course, SHOOTING some 
               underwater, some SLO-MO, as she knives through the water, 
               her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her medium. 
               The SEQUENCE should convey not only the grace of her strokes 
               and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimming, 
               its synthesis of power and form.

               As she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in the 
               pool next to her. It's Jake, and he's racing her the final 
               lap. She immediately responds to the challenge, digging 
               harder, picking up her kick. They go neck and neck for 20 
               yards, but Lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a 
               body length at the wall. Both are winded.

</b>
               Driving through the city on her way home. Lynn glances in 
               the rear-view mirror and spots Taylor following her. She 
               smiles to herself. Taylor, of course, thinks he's gone 
               undetected.

               We begin a SHORT SEQUENCE during which Lynn tries to lose 
               Taylor in a chase through Cleveland, car vs. batting helmet.

               The logistics will have to be worked out in Cleveland, but 
               suffice it to say, by the end of the chase she appears to 
               have ditched him.

               Lynn comes up the stairs, unlocks the apartment door and 
               steps inside. There's no particular urgency. She feels sure 
               she's shaken Taylor.

               The apartment is full of packing boxes. Tired from the chase, 
               Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch. 
               It's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost Taylor. 
               She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some 
               sign of him.

               Seeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed, 
               and starts back to the couch, when something stops her. It's 
               Taylor, standing in the doorway.

               Taylor gives a perfunctory nod. They look at each other a 
               second. There's still plenty there. Taylor begins to come 
               toward her. We hear his cleats on the floor. She backs off, 
               but not with real conviction.

                         once and we all got quiet and hid 
                         behind the furniture. It was a guy

                         they were talkin' about sendin' me

                         still an All-Star. I don't care about

               Taylor comes forward to kiss her, tentatively at first. Their

               Taylor's spikes come down across her skirt, catching in the

               Taylor is staring out the window, still morose about Lynn's 
               leaving. A stack of Classics Illustrated comics sits next to 
               him.

<b>               INT. THE SHEFFIELD ARMS - DAY

               We pick up Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn coming into their 
               dilapidated hotel room. Peeling walls and ceilings, rickety 
               furniture, rusted bathroom fixtures. Taylor sprawls down on 
               one of the cots. It collapses on the floor in a cloud of 
               dust.

<b>               EXT. YANKEE STADIUM - DAY
</b>
               Vaughn is on the mound warming up.

<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         So, Ricky Vaughn, roughed up in his 
                         only other appearance against the 
                         Yankees, will see what he can do 
                         with the Bronx Bombers this time. 
                         Vaughn, after a slow start, has come 
                         on lately and now leads the American 
                         League in strikeouts with 221.

               Vaughn finishes his warmups. As Taylor pumps the ball down 
               to second, Vaughn hears a voice from the Yankee dug-out.

<b>                                     VOICE
</b>                         Hey, jailbird!

               Vaughn glances over and sees that one of the Yankees is 
               dressed in a striped prison uniform. He also wears long 
               earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses. Vaughn tries 
               to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken.

               Vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch. He winds 
               and fires. The Yankee LEADOFF HITTER rips a one-hopper to 
               the wall in right center. Hayes runs it down and guns it 
               back to the infield to hold the guy to a double. The convict 
               whoops it up.

               Vaughn gets back up on the rubber. As he comes to the stretch, 
               he catches sight of the convict again. The guy is doing a 
               pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much 
               to the delight of his teammates. Vaughn throws his pitch in 
               the dirt and all the way to the backstop. The runner on second 
               goes to third.

<b>                                     TAYLOR
</b>                              (throwing the ball 
                              back)
                         C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.

               Vaughn gets ready again. The convict finishes picking the 
               lock and then is suddenly arrested. He puts his hands against 
               the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking 
               up the whole bench. Vaughn is getting a little steamed. His 
               next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a 
               run.

<b>               THREE SHOTS OF VAUGHN

               throwing pitches, followed by:

<b>               SHOTS
</b>
               of the THIRD HITTER lining a double down the right field 
               line, the FOURTH HITTER a triple off the center field wall, 
               and the FIFTH HITTER a single to right. The scoreboard now 
               reads 4 to 0 Yankees. Taylor comes out to talk to Vaughn.

<b>                                     TAYLOR
</b>                         What's the problem, Rick? You're 
                         throwin' basketballs up there. That 
                         guy in the dugout botherin' you?

<b>                                     VAUGHN
</b>                         Naw, I'm all right.

<b>                                     TAYLOR
</b>                         Forget him. Worry about the guys 
                         carryin' bats. C'mon, Ricky, let's 
                         get nasty.

               Vaughn nods as Taylor trots back behind the plate.

               Vaughn gets set again as his old nemesis, Haywood, steps 
               into the batter's box. Haywood has a sly smile on his face.

               As Vaughn comes to his stretch, the convict goes back into 
               his act. He's in jail now, struggling against the bars. 
               Finally he bends over and grabs his ankles, while one of his 
               teammates humps up against him, pretending to bugger him. 
               This sends the Yankee bench into hysterics.

               Vaughn has lost it now. He fires to the plate and Haywood 
               creams another tape measure job into the upper deck. Hayes 
               doesn't even bother to run back to the wall. He just watches 
               it go. 6-0 Yankees.

                         control, he was ready for the Yankees.

                         as few squib hits and take a 6-0

                         short as the Yankees held on for a 6-
                         5 victory, although they didn't do 
                         squat after the first inning. Anyway,

</b>
               Suzanne Dorn is watching the 11 o'clock news. HAL CHARLES is 
               holding forth.

</b>                         The Indians are spending the night 
                         in Detroit and will bus back to 
                         Cleveland in the morning. We're going 
                         to go back now to Ross Farmer who's 
                         standing by at the Hotel Stanley 
                         where the Indians are staying in 
                         Detroit. Ross?

               The scene shifts to...

<b>               THE LOBBY OF THE STANLEY HOTEL
</b>
               where Ross Farmer stands, microphone in hand. Behind him 
               several players can be seen partying in the bar.

<b>                                     FARMER
</b>                         Thank you, Hal. As you can see, the 
                         Indians are in high spirits tonight, 
                         looking forward to their showdown 
                         with the Yankees. Who will start 
                         that game is still a matter of some 
                         conjecture.

               As Ross talks, Dorn walks INTO THE FRAME in the far background 
               with his arm around a YOUNG LOVELY. They're nuzzling and 
               hugging, unaware they're on camera, albeit in the background. 
               Suzanne doesn't miss it though. She moves closer to the screen 
               to get a better look.

               Dorn and the Girl get in an elevator together, obviously 
               going upstairs. As the elevator closes, Suzanne hits the off 
               button. She sits there a second in shock, and then her face 
               begins to harden.

<b>               INT. TAYLOR'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Taylor and DARLA are undressing, preparatory to getting into 
               bed. They are definitely no strangers to each other.

<b>                                     DARLA
</b>                         You still got that black Corvette? 
                         The one that the sound system took 
                         up the whole trunk?

</b>                         No, I had to sell it.

</b>                         I thought they gave them to ya.

</b>                         Not after your knees go bad.

</b>                         That's all right, you'll be gettin' 
                         a new one now.

               Darla is down to her bra and panties. She puts her leg up on 
               the bed to unhook her stockings. Taylor is about to take off 
               his pants, but stops.

<b>                                     TAYLOR
</b>                         Darla, I don't think I can do this.

</b>                         What do you mean? We did this between

</b>                         I guess I'm just not that guy anymore.

               Darla looks at him a long beat.

<b>                                     DARLA

                         Happens to the best of them sooner 
                         or later. What's her name?

<b>               EXT. HALL OUTSIDE TAYLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               The door opens and Darla comes out, fully clothed now. She 
               turns to say goodbye to Jake, who is still bare-chested.

<b>                                     DARLA
</b>                         So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna 
                         devote a whole chapter to you in my 
                         book.

               As Darla gives Jake a goodbye peck, the elevator door opens 
               across the hall, and out steps Lynn. She's obviously rattled 
               by the sight of Taylor and Darla together.

<b>                                     LYNN
</b>                         Excuse me. I was in town for a 
                         conference and thought I'd drop by, 
                         but I can see you're busy...

               With that she quickly steps back into the elevator and the 
               doors close.

<b>                                     TAYLOR
</b>                         Lynn, wait...

               Taylor leaps to the elevator door, but it's too late. He 
               then sprints to the end of the hall and down the stairs.

<b>               TAYLOR
</b>
               running down the stairs and into the lobby. Seeing no sign 
               of Lynn, he races out the front door to see her pulling out 
               in a taxi. He can only stand and watch her disappear into 
               the night.

<b>               INT. THE INDIANS' BUS - DAY
</b>
               We PICK UP Vaughn making his way to the back of the bus, 
               where Brown has his "office" on the last seat. Most of the 
               other players are asleep after a late night of partying.

</b>                         Yeh, Rick. I just wanted to tell you 
                         that I'm startin' Harris tomorrow 
                         against the Yankees, even though 
                         it's your turn in the rotation.

               Vaughn says nothing, but he's clearly disappointed.

<b>                                     BROWN
</b>                         He's got more experience and a little 
                         better record against the Yankees.

                         You're one of the guys that got us 
                         here.

</b>                         Yeh, okay.

               Vaughn turns and walks back up the aisle. Brown watches him 
               go, knowing he's still upset.

<b>               EXT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY
</b>
               The Indian bus pulls up outside the Stadium, where a group 
               of several thousand fans wait. The players are showered with 
               cheers and applause as they file out.

<b>               INT. BAR - NIGHT
</b>
               Vaughn sits in the bar alone, nursing a beer, still troubled 
               by his demotion. He hears a sexy VOICE behind him.

<b>                                     VOICE
</b>                         You mind if I join you?

               Vaughn turns around to see Suzanne Dorn. She's dressed to 
               draw blood, looking better than we've ever seen her. She 
               slides into the booth.

<b>                                     VAUGHN
</b>                         I don't think I'd be very good company 
                         tonight.

</b>                         Nothin'. Job problem.

               Vaughn falls silent. Suzanne stares at him with a devastating 
               combination of sexual heat and tender admiration. She's 
               pulling out all the stops. Vaughn's a little flustered.

<b>                                     VAUGHN

</b>                         I know, but that's not why I came 
                         over. I don't chase ball players.

<b>                                     VAUGHN
</b>                         Why did you come over then?

               With that she walks on out, leaving Vaughn dazed by the 
               knowledge of who he's just slept with.

<b>               THE HALL OUTSIDE VAUGHN'S ROOM

               Taylor is coming back from the bathroom down the hall as 
               Suzanne comes out of Vaughn's room.

               Taylor is amazed by what he's just seen. As soon as Suzanne 
               is out of sight, he goes to Vaughn's room and opens the door.

               Vaughn is sitting on his bed in a state of disbelief.

               by her Father. As she starts up the steps, she sees that 
               both sides are lined by the entire Cleveland Indians team in 
               uniform. They form an arch of bats as she passes. At the top 
               of the steps is Taylor. Lynn stops as her father ushers her

               slowly down the steps past his teammates.

</b>                         We were broke. We couldn't afford 
                         anything better. Donald left the 
                         team nearly bankrupt. If we'd had 
                         another losing season, I would have 
                         had to sell the team. I knew we 
                         couldn't win with the team we had, 
                         so I decided to bring in new players 
                         and see how they'd do with the proper 
                         motivation. There was never any offer 
                         from Miami. I made it all up.

                         didn't, did I?

               Brown has no comeback for this. He knows now that she's 
               telling the truth.

                         I personally scouted every member of 
                         this team, except Hayes, of course. 
                         He was a surprise. They all had flaws 
                         which concealed their real talent, 
                         or I wouldn't have been able to get 
                         them. But I knew if anyone could 
                         straighten them out, you could. And 
                         if you tell them any of this, I will 
                         fire you.

               Brown can only shake his head at this whole thing.

               The two shake hands. Brown looks at Rachel a beat, still 
               looking for some sign of duplicity. Finally he gives her a 
               grudging smile of respect.

               starkly quiet in contrast to the stadium outside. Each player

               Down in the dugout, the players are lined up ready to take

               The Indians charge onto the field to a standing ovation.

               In the center field bleachers Thelma's victory blanket 
               containing the scores of every Indian game for the season,

                         his way out with the help of some

                         tonight. As a matter of fact, he 
                         hasn't touched the ball yet.

               The crowd and bleacher band begins to clap as Dorn takes his 
               lead. Cerrano swings at the first pitch and misses. An audible 
               groan goes through the crowd.

               The Yankee pitcher gets set again, and throws Cerrano a big, 
               roundhouse curve. He misses it a foot. Strike two.

                         chicken.

               Cerrano steps out and begins to talk to his bat, gesturing 
               and pointing as if arguing with his wife.

                         I do it myself.

               Cerrano gets back in the box and digs in. The Yankee pitcher 
               comes to his stretch and delivers. Another big breaking curve 
               ball. Cerrano swings and knocks the crap out of it. Everyone 
               in the stands and on the bench jumps to their feet, rooting 
               for the ball to get out.

               stares at him with undisguised venom.

               As Vaughan gets to the mound, he sees Patton getting his 
               convict uniform on in the Yankee dugout. He looks away to 
               see Haywood in the on-deck circle smiling out at him.

               Meanwhile, the CROWD has gone nuts at the sight of Vaughn. 
               Bobby, Vic and Johnny are blasting out "Wild Thing" on the 
               tom-toms and the whole stadium, 75,000 strong, is singing

               No sooner has Taylor settled in behind the plate, than Dorn 
               starts toward the mound. Vaughn watches him come with fear 
               and trepidation.

                         Oh, shit.

               Dorn arrives at the mound, and holds out his hand for the 
               ball. Vaughn gives it to him. Dorn rubs it up, staring long 
               and hard into Vaughn's eyes. Vaughn is sweating bullets. 
               Finally Dorn speaks.

                         rear back and strike this motherfucker 
                         out.

               He smiles and hands Vaughn the ball back. Vaughn returns the 
               smile and accepts the ball. While Dorn trots back to his 
               position, Vaughn turns his back to the plate for one last 
               moment of concentration. As he turns around to face us, we 
               see a new man as the wicked opening CHORDS of X's "Wild Thing" 
               are heard on the TRACK, only louder and more savage than 
               before.

               Vaughn steps up on the rubber, his face hardened into fierce 
               resolve. There's nothing nervous about him now. This kid is 
               gonna make somebody pay.

               Taylor sets down a sign. Two fingers for the curve ball. 
               Vaughn shakes it off. Taylor puts down another sign. Vaughn 
               shakes it off. Finally, Taylor puts down one finger -- the 
               fast ball. Vaughn nods with steely purpose.

               Vaughn winds and delivers a hissing blur toward the plate. 
               Haywood takes a ferocious swing and misses. Strike one.

               We see the number 97 come up on the digital readout of the 
               SPEED GUN which a club employee holds behind the screen.

                         foot hole comin' out.

               Taylor gets ready to flash another sign. The convict jumps 
               up and down trying to distract Vaughn. No way.

               Taylor puts down one finger. Vaughn nods and then winds and 
               fires again, another blazing rocket. Haywood takes a wicked 
               rip, but doesn't get it. Strike two. 99 comes up on the gun.

               The fans are going wild. They're all standing now, yelling 
               for a strikeout. Vaughn gets back up on the rubber with the 
               look of an animal sighting prey. Taylor gets down to give 
               the sign.

                         shit you can hardly walk, there's no 
                         way you can get around on this guy's 
                         fast ball. So I want the absolute 
                         truth here. Can you beat this guy?

               Taylor starts for the plate, as Duke finishes his warmups. 
               Brown comes down the dugout steps.

                         Send Hayes the first pitch. I don't 
                         want Taylor takin' too many strikes.

               Pepper begins flashing signs out to Hayes. Duke gets up on 
               the rubber and takes his stretch. Hayes leads away, crouching 
               low. Duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman 
               slapping a hard tag on Hayes, but Hayes is back.

               The crowd is on its feet again. The "GO" chant starts, 
               punctuated by thousands of black-gloved hands punching the 
               night air.

               Duke comes set again. Hayes leads away. Duke watches him, 
               checks him again. We go to SLOW MOTION as Duke kicks and 
               comes to the plate.

               Hayes takes off like a shot, head down, eating up ground. 
               Taylor swings and misses. The Yankee catcher comes up 
               throwing, rifling a clothesline dart to second base. Hayes 
               leaves his feet diving for the bag. The second baseman snaps 
               down the tag. Too late. Hayes is in there.

               The stadium is really rockin' now. Duke prowls the mound. 
               Taylor steps out of the box and flashes a sign to Brown.

<b>                                     BROWN
</b>                         Flashing some signals. That's a hell 
                         of an idea.

               Brown flashes a sign out to Hayes. A hint of a smile comes 
               over Hayes' face as he dusts himself off.

               Taylor steps back in as Duke gets up on the rubber. Taylor 
               digs in his back foot, then points to the left field bleachers 
               ala Babe Ruth.

</b>                         What's this? Taylor is pointing to 
                         the bleachers, calling his shot.

               The crowd, electrified by Taylor's gesture, remains on its 
               feet. Duke stares in at Taylor, comes to his stretch and 
               then lets go a steaming fast ball right at Taylor's head. 
               Taylor goes down in a swirl of dust, the ball missing him by 
               inches. The stadium explodes with BOOS, but as soon as Taylor 
               picks himself up, the crowd begins to ROAR again.

               Bobby, Vic and Johnny are pounding out a heavy beat on the 
               TOM-TOMS. Everyone in the stadium begins to CLAP in unison 
               with the DRUMS.

               Taylor steps back in and once again points to the bleachers.

                         Unbelievable. They're on their feet 
                         here, stomping, clapping. C'mon, 
                         join in wherever you are out there. 
                         Let's hear you, Cleveland.

<b>               THE LONGSHOREMEN
</b>
               and several of their friends at their bar, huddled around 
               the RADIO with the punks and heavy metal kids we saw before. 
               Slowly they begin to clap in time with the tom-toms which 
               are audible on the T.V.

<b>               THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE
</b>
               at the opera with his wife, a radio earplug in his ear. His 
               hand taps on his leg in sync with the TOM-TOMS.

<b>               THE TWO KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS

               (Sc 222 before scene 221) beating on their shovels in the 
               bullpen.

<b>               LARGE APARTMENT BUILDING

               FRAMED against the Cleveland skyline. In several of the lit 
               windows we see people banging things or clapping.

<b>               THE STADIUM AGAIN
</b>
               Duke gets back on the hill. Getting the sign he wants, he 
               comes to his stretch, checking Hayes at second.

               As Duke starts his delivery to the plate, we go to SLOW 
               MOTION. The clapping in the stadium stops as everyone hushes 
               to watch the pitch. We...

<b>               THE LONGSHOREMEN, THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE, THE GROUNDSKEEPERS 
</b><b>               AND THE APARTMENT DWELLERS

               They've all stopped too in anticipation of the pitch.

<b>               THE STADIUM
</b>
               Everything from here on will continue to be in SLOW MOTION. 
               As Duke whips his arm toward the plate, Hayes takes off for 
               third. Taylor, instead of swinging away, shortens up on the 
               bat and bunts Duke's pitch down the third base line.

               The Yankee third baseman, caught completely unaware, charges 
               the ball frantically.

<b>               TAYLOR
</b>
               barreling down the line toward first on his sore legs, giving 
               it everything he's got.

<b>               THE THIRD BASEMAN
</b>
               scooping up the ball barehanded and firing on the run to 
               first.

<b>               TAYLOR
</b>
               pounding down the line. He strains for the bag as the Yankee 
               first baseman stretches to his limit for the throw. Taylor 
               and the ball arrive at almost the same time. Taylor hits the 
               bag and then sprawls in the dirt as his knees give out.

               The umpire brings up his arms, and spreads them wide. Safe. 
               Taylor's beaten it.

               The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes 
               fear into his heart across the field. It's...

<b>               HAYES
</b>
               streaking for home, trying to score all the way from second 
               on a bunt.

               The first baseman fires to the plate, as the catcher positions 
               himself for the throw. Hayes launches into a flying feet-
               first slide. The catcher brings the tag down. Hayes hooks to 
               the outside, his trailing foot reaching for the plate.

               Hayes' foot catches the corner of the plate. The umpire puts 
               the palms down and whips them apart. It's all over, folks. 

<b>               SLOW MOTION ENDS

                         win it!!

               Pandemonium breaks loose in Municipal Stadium. Rachel hugs 
               Donovan, dances around, punches the air, then hugs Donovan 
               again. Everywhere people are hugging and kissing each other. 
               Bobby, Vic and Johnny are going berserk in the bleachers. 
               Thelma sits quietly, a tear rolling down her cheek.

               of our other fans. We see...

               A) The Business Executive stand up and yell "Yes!" in the 
               middle of the opera. Several other men stand up and express 
               their excitement as well.

               B) The Longshoremen whoop it up in their bar -- exchanging 
               fives and hugs with the punkers and heavy metal kids.

               C) The various apartment dwellers dancing, clapping, yelling 
               out the windows.

               D) The two Korean Groundskeepers just shaking their heads in 
               amazement.

               E) Elsewhere in the stadium, the joyous exultation continues 
               unabated. The crowd pours onto the field as Hayes runs toward 
               Taylor and literally leaps into his arms.

               F) The two spin around throwing their fists in the air.

               G) Cerrano and Harris embrace. Dorn gives Vaughn a hug, then 
               steps back and decks him with a right hand.

               H) Dorn pulls Vaughn back to his feet, and they hug again.

               I) Up in the stands, Rachel watches all this with tears in 
               her eyes.

               Taylor starts off the field when he sees something that 
               catches his eye. Standing by the field rail is Lynn. She 
               holds up her left hand and smiles. There's no ring on it. 
               Taylor races over to her as she jumps down from the rail and 
               hugs herself to him. We HOLD on the celebration as it swirls 
               all around them, and...
