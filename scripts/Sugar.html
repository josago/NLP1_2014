<b>1    EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - DAY                           
</b>
     A high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field
     carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in
     progress.

<b>A1   ON THE FIELD                                                            
</b>
     Wearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark-
     skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned
     Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised
     for the next pitch.

     CLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZÚCAR/SUGAR - 19,
     lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the
     oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his
     chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts
     his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES
     the ball toward the plate.

     THUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball
     slams inside.

<b>                           UMPIRE
</b>               Strike three!

     The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's
     overpowering fastball.

     FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH
     REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS.

     BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in
     Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS
     clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which
     read 92 and 93 MPH.

     As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE
     (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside
     fastball.

     The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and
     home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and
     first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands
     between them and the runners reach base safely.

B1   FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO                 B1
     ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and
     SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards.

C1   ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and     C1
     kicks the dirt.

     Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a
     tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the
     dirt.

     Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry
     fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with
     a friendly, but authoritative, grin.

     He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through
     it, getting nothing but air.

</b>
     The TEAM (about 35 young men) gather around several tables for
     their standard baked chicken and rice lunch. The mood is
     friendly and playful as players tease each other across the
     tables. Miguel, sitting with his friends MARCOS (2nd base) and
     ALFONSO (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert.

<b>                          MARCOS
</b>              Check out Sugar... Puts on twenty
              pounds in two months; now he's going
              for twenty more.

<b>                          MIGUEL
</b>                   (mouth full of food)
              All muscle, baby. Rock solid.

     For some NEW PLAYERS, distinguishable in the sea of BLUE
     uniforms by their BLACK "tryout" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it
     is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their
     last.   One of them, SALVADOR (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his
     plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat.

<b>                          PEDRO
</b>              Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere.

     A few of the guys LAUGH.

<b>                          MIGUEL
</b>                   (to Pedro)
              If you hustled half as much as him,
              maybe you'd be hungry too.

     The other guys "ohhhh" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel
     exchange subtle grins.

    Kids crowd around in a circle, repeating after the animated
    English instructor, SEÑOR SANCHEZ, who goes over some English
    BASEBALL TERMS in the center. As he repeats the terms, he

    It's dark, and most of the team sits around an old TV set
    watching the climactic final scene of Field of Dreams dubbed in
    Spanish. Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice
    that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner.

    Miguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec
    room down a hall, and into...

    The Kansas City Director of Minor League Operations, RUDY
    HUBBARD (white, 40s), watches a TRYOUT SESSION, where TWO SKINNY
    TEENS in worn street clothes pitch to uniformed catchers. Their
    AGENT talks on a cell phone nearby.

    Alvarez, the academy director, approaches one of the kids,
    whispers in his ear. The kid smiles tentatively.

    Alvarez joins Rudy and they speak in English.

<b>                         RUDY
</b>             What'd you tell him?

<b>                         ALVAREZ
</b>             I told him to grip the ball more
             gently. Like a tit.

    They both crack up.

    FROM THE TRYOUT MOUND. The kid looks over to the two men pow-
    wowing about him. He breathes in, nervous...

    hitting weak ground balls and foul tips.

</b>             3000.   When I was fifteen.

    Rudy smiles and moves on.    Alvarez follows.   Pedro watches the
    men as they walk away.

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        Salvador Torres. Been practicing with
        the team for almost a week. Still raw,
        but he's got a lot of potential.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        We gonna sign him?

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        Soon. Soon. We want to play it low-
        key, see what his agent says.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        How much you think?

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        They've gotten two offers from other
        clubs. Agent says they were around a
        hundred.

Rudy raises his eyebrows.

<b>                      ALVAREZ
</b>             (firm)
        He's good.

Rudy looks over to Miguel.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        What about him?

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        Miguel Santos. Great arm. We signed
        him two years ago for fifteen.

Miguel fires in a pitch.    Rudy nods, impressed.

<b>                      RUDY
</b>        Good deal.    He throw any junk?

<b>                   ALVAREZ
</b>             (in Spanish)
        Sugar!

Miguel looks over, sees the American with Alvarez.

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>        Show us your curve.

Miguel nods, nervous, focuses. He pitches.    The ball curves
very subtly over the plate for a strike.

<b>                     RUDY
</b>        Not bad.   Mind if I try something?

Miguel looks back to the men.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        Hey, kid, do you mind?   May I?

Miguel stares blankly at Rudy, not understanding.

<b>                    ALVAREZ
</b>             (in Spanish)
        Give him the ball.

Miguel hands Rudy the ball, and Rudy demonstrates how to handle
a knuckle curve ball, which looks strangely unorthodox, with the
index finger tucked against the baseball.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        Spike curve. Gives you more rotation,
        more movement.
             (hands Miguel the ball)
        You try.

Miguel struggles to emulate Rudy's grip, so Rudy maneuvers his
fingers into the correct position. Alvarez laughs.

<b>                     ALVAREZ
</b>        Vamos!   Let's go! Pitch it!

Miguel looks over to his catcher, Jose. Winds up the next
pitch, and soars it 5 feet wide of the mark.

Rudy and Alvarez laugh.   Miguel looks back over his shoulder.

<b>                    RUDY
</b>        It's okay, son, these things take time.
        You'll figure it out.

Rudy pats Miguel on the back and walks off with Alvarez. Miguel
stares at them hard as they go. He turns back to his catcher,
determined, squeezes the ball in spike curve formation.
Delivers.

Misses badly again. JUMP CUTS take us through a half-dozen more
bad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather
around, some laughing, until...

...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air,
landing centered in Jose's mitt.

The other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares
straight ahead. After a beat, he smiles wide.

      Modest homes line the neighborhood, fashioned from corrugated
      tin, painted in bold colors, no two houses alike. A skinny pig
      roams a barren lot. A group of WOMEN with their hair in curlers
      sit on crates around a dominoes table. They wave their hellos
      to Miguel, who smiles back.

      Local KIDS play stickball in a trash-strewn clearing with
      makeshift mitts fashioned from old milk cartons or cardboard.
      They see Miguel and rush toward him as he paces up the block,
      SHOUTING his name.

      As Miguel approaches home, he makes eye contact with a girl,
      ERICA (15), buying water from a delivery truck. She smiles.

      With the kids still clamoring around Miguel, he stops, unzips
      his duffel and hands out some used baseballs. The kids grab the
      balls, then run off to play.

     watches an enormous television, which feels incongruous in the

     LITTLE KIDS (10-14 years old) playing around them.

     A YOUNG PITCHER fires in a fastball that BEANS the YOUNG HITTER

     Miguel's shoes with an old toothbrush as Frank cracks open a
     beer. Frank points out one of the kids on the field.

     Miguel on the mound. Takes a deep breath. He utilizes every
     ounce of strength to deliver a pitch, and...

     CRACK! The visiting Detroit Academy HITTER knocks the ball over
     the left field wall for a homerun, wherein...

     BLAH! Miguel throws up on the mound.   All the players gasp in
     disgust, but Reyes just laughs.

     Miguel looks over to Alvarez, sitting under an umbrella with a
     clipboard, then to Reyes, hoping he'll yank him out of the game,

     Miguel tries to shake off the cobwebs, steps on the rubber,

     a blazing fastball.

     After the third out, Miguel walks back to the dugout.     He takes

              from a couple Dominican rookies when
              you go to the U.S. for Spring Training
              this season.

     waiting for their bags. Miguel perks up upon seeing his,
     quickly snatches it off the belt. The others smile and APPLAUD.

              below you pushing to take your job. We

              for less than 50 positions come April

      everything he has into a hearty fastball, which...

      ...sails right over the plate for a STRIKE, as Leonard calmly
      watches and readies himself for the next one.

      Feeling confident with his stuff, Miguel fires in the next
      pitch, and...

     The runner at second is too far off the bag, so Brad hops to his
     feet, and fires a laser beam to second, finishing off one of the
     sweetest double-plays you'll ever see.

     About a dozen young players hop off the bus and grab their bags.
     Some of them jump into waiting taxis, but Miguel sees his name

     The Higgins' son, MICHAEL (40s), and his wife, HILARY (40s), and
     their daughter, ANNE (17), join Earl and Helen for Miguel's
     first dinner in Iowa.

     Helen leads the table in grace...

<b>                          HELEN
</b>              Dear Lord... Thank you for the meal we
              are about to eat. And for blessing us
              with our new guest. And guiding him
              safely on his journey from the
              Dominican Republic to Bridgetown...

Miguel glances around the table.   Everyone's head is bowed and
eyes closed.

His eyes stop on Anne, seated across from him. She's an
attractive all-American girl, but would never dream of flaunting
her good looks. After taking her in, Miguel closes his eyes.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>        ...And finally, Lord... Please look
        kindly over the Swing this season. May
        all the players stay healthy and...
        well, why not?... if there's anything
        you can do to help us win another
        championship, we'll take that too...
        Amen.

The table laughs, followed by a chorus of Amens. Miguel opens
his eyes, greeted with smiles. He smiles too, as everyone
passes dishes around the table.

<b>                    MICHAEL
</b>        So, Miguel... Do - you - eat - meatloaf
        - back home?

<b>                    HELEN
</b>        I already told you, Michael, he doesn't
        speak any English.

<b>                    MICHAEL
</b>        I know but... I'm curious to know what
        he thinks of the meatloaf.

<b>                    EARL
</b>        What do you care?   You didn't cook it.

<b>                    HILARY
</b>             (to Michael)
        I doubt they have meatloaf in the
        Dominican Republic, dear.

<b>                    ANNE
</b>        I bet they have something similar.
        They probably just have another name
        for it.

All eyes are on Miguel as he nervously takes a bite.

A suspenseful beat, until...

...he smiles and nods.

Everyone sighs, smiles, and nods back.

     Miguel enters the room, looking for his locker.    The Clubby
     takes notice.

     A stunning little park that sits at the Mississippi River's

     INSERT: in a little corner of the package Miguel reads, "MADE IN

     He checks the price tag.

Jorge fakes massive crowd applause.   Miguel laughs.

     Miguel takes a new calendar out of a plastic shopping bag.    It
     features iconic images of New York City. He peels off the
     plastic and pins it to the month of April on his wall.

     CLOSE ON Miguel's hands tearing open a small package from his

     baseball player with a Kansas City jersey from Luis, along with

      We STAY ON Miguel for the game's highlights, JUMP CUTTING his
      reactions to the best plays of the game.

      PLAY 1: he casually spits sunflower seed shells, then CLAPS the
      final out of the inning, high-fiving players returning to the
      dugout.

      PLAY 2: chats to Jorge, when they react to the CRACK of the
      bat, leap to their feet, eagerly anticipate an umpire's call,
      and CHEER when the call goes their team's way.

      PLAY 3:   grimaces at the sight of a hit-by-pitch.

      PLAY 4:   leaps to his feet, CLAPS.

      PLAY 5:   leaps to his feet, doesn't clap.   Sits back down.

      PLAY 6: Miguel and Jorge sway to the seventh inning stretch
      classic "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

      PLAY 7: sitting with Brad, they both point to something on the
      field and crack up laughing. Of course, we don't see what
      they're laughing at.

      PLAY 8: standing with Jorge and the rest of the players, the
      mood is tense. The players react to a hit ball, as their heads
      jerk toward the outfield, waiting, waiting, waiting, and...

      begin dancing with him and Miguel. At first cautious, Miguel
      and his partner ease closer, until Miguel's hands are on her
      hips, leading her in rhythm to the hip-hop jam, while mixing in
      some Latin moves as well.

      As Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners, several
      local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork.

      The car backs down the road and the players' voices fade out
      with the hum of the engine.

      An upstairs light goes on. Miguel looks up to the Higgins'

</b>
      Half-uniformed players hang out, eating sandwiches, passing
      around a PLAYBOY magazine, signing souvenir baseballs, and
      talking at full volume. Hip-hop BLASTS from a stereo, competing
      with an old DUKES OF HAZARD rerun on the TV. HARDY, the
      Bridgetown Swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey
      head under one arm.

      Miguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first
      start. He touches Luis' drawing, which is taped to the inside
      of his locker. Closes his eyes, takes a deep breath.

      ON THE MOUND. Miguel opens his eyes, as the LEAD-OFF HITTER
      steps into the batter's box. He takes a moment, crosses
      himself. Play ball.

      Miguel nods to his catcher, Orlando, then fires in the first
      pitch high for a ball.

      When he gets the ball back, he looks to the stands, where...

      ...Earl, Helen, Michael, and Hilary sit uncomfortably close to
      the field in choice box seats.

      He takes a nervous breath, fires in the second pitch.      Ball two.
      Same for the third. And forth.

      The batter jogs to first, and the crowd GRUMBLES.

</b>               Santos, apparently feeling the
               butterflies on his first professional
               outing. Hailing all the way from the
               Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the
               club with his power during Spring
               Training. But he's off to a rocky

      Jorge comes over from third base as the batter walks to first.

<b>                           JORGE
</b>               Relax, Sugar. It's the same game we

               Just a game, man. So relax. Let's
               have some fun. Okay?

      Miguel nods.    Jorge points out the next batter.   Another
      Dominican.

<b>                            JORGE
</b>               See?   Just like home.

      Jorge runs back to his position at third.   Miguel tucks his
      index finger into his knuckle curve grip.   Delivers...

      And the next pitch...

      ...is hit sharply to Jorge at third, who fires it over to second
      for one, and on to first for a double play.

      The crowd goes WILD and Miguel finally exhales.

      One, two, three... he mows down the next BATTER on three
      consecutive strikes. More APPLAUSE.

      Orlando hands him his first strikeout ball. Miguel takes a
      seat, wipes the sweat from his head, then looks down at Anne's
      address scribbled on his forearm.

      The next BATTER dribbles a spinning groundball at Jorge, but it
      squirts through his legs into left field, allowing the runner to
      score an unearned run from second.

      Stu walks toward the mound, signals for the bullpen.   He and
      Orlando greet Miguel on the mound.

               But that wasn't my fault. I can go

</b>                    (in Spanish)
               Take it easy; it's your first game.

      Though he doesn't speak Spanish, Stu knows exactly what's
      happening. He takes the ball from Miguel with a smile, but
      Miguel doesn't move, still reluctant to leave the mound.

      As the FANS begin to cheer his stellar debut...

<b>                           STU
</b>               You hear that? It's for you, kid.

      Orlando smiles, pats Miguel on the butt, and Miguel finally
      starts his slow walk off the field. As we follow him off, the
      FANS rise to their feet and Miguel approaches the dugout to a
      standing ovation. On his way in, he's greeted by his teammates
      with congratulatory high-fives.

      AT THIRD Jorge stares at the dirt, frustrated by his misplay.

      The teens crowd into the living room, squeezing together on
      sofas, recliners, and desk chairs. Miguel sits behind the
      majority of the group, not sure what's going on. Anne stands
      before them...

<b>                           ANNE

               our group. So, I think this just goes
               to show the great work we've been doing
               in spreading the word. But this year,
               I want us to work harder. Now, I know
               a lot of you are studying for SATs or
               working on college applications. And
               all of that is important, but we need
               to remember that our spiritual
               accomplishments are more important.
               What we do in school or for a job...
               that's just a small part of who we are.
               We're only here by the grace of God, so

       Miguel checks his appearance in the bathroom mirror, while Jorge
       talks on the telephone with somebody back home. Jorge appears

      swiss army knife. Stops when he hears a burst of MALE AND

      earlier - a   pendant with a cornstalk design. The NYC calendar
      on the wall   in the background indicates we are now in JUNE.

      When he's done, he goes to his duffel, pulls out his English

      Miguel sits on his bed, opens the book.

</b>
      A batter swings and misses for strike three.    The catcher throws
      the ball around the horn.

      Miguel steps off the mound, grabs the rosin bag for traction,
      gets the ball back.

      His next pitch is hit on the ground toward the first base line,
      where the first baseman makes a nice back-handed play...

      Miguel sprints over to cover the bag, receives the toss, but...

<b>      OUCH!
</b>
      ...the RUNNER storms into Miguel before he has time to pull his
      foot off the bag, knocking them both hard to the ground.   The
      runner is called out, but Miguel is slow getting to his feet.

      Stu and the TRAINER run out to check on him. Jorge rushes over
      from third, and Orlando also comes to help translate.

</b>               Let him toss a few warm-ups.

      The umpire grants Miguel a few "test" pitches.

      Visibly shaken, Miguel sets up for a warm-up pitch, breathes
      deeply, and delivers. He lands gingerly on his right ankle,
      makes a face.

      Stu and the trainer exchange glances. Miguel notices this, as
      he sets up for another pitch. The trainer shakes his head, no.

      As Stu reaches for the ball, Miguel pulls it away.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>               I am okay.   Please.

      Stu and the trainer sense Miguel's anxiety.     Stu puts his arm on
      Miguel's shoulder for comfort.

<b>                           STU
</b>               You're okay, I know, but let's just be
               sure... Give me the ball, son.

      Miguel sizes them up, reluctantly hands the ball over, and limps
      off the field with Stu and the other players looking after.

      foot, and a crutch leans     against the wall behind him.

Miguel nods, takes a bite of potatoes.   There is an awkward beat
as everybody chews.

silence.

               fell. There was a lot of blood.

      for a beat, until...

</b>        Not for you though. Yankee fans are
        crazy. I can't take the risk... I'll

A beat as Miguel looks at Jorge with concern.    Jorge shakes it
off.

</b>        You worry too much, Sugar. I'll be
        okay. I mean, it's just a game, right?

      Miguel throws in a pitch, which is lined directly over his head
      for a base hit. He swears to himself as he sprints over to back
      up home plate where the runner scores easily.

      Miguel storms into the empty clubhouse, grabs a bat from the
      wall rack, and smashes a water dispenser unit to the ground,
      spilling water everywhere. As he observes the mess, his
      breathing steadies, and...

      He glances over to the entrance, where the clubhouse manager
      stares at him, disapproving.

               control. Can you understand what I'm
               saying? You need to learn that your
               actions have consequences. So we're

               home's gonna be too proud of... Is it?

      Miguel turns his gaze to Stu. Though he doesn't fully
      understand what he's saying, Stu's intention is clear.

<b>                           STU
</b>               So you should think real hard next

               working harder--

      Jeff Elks instructs Miguel, alone, in the small room with a
      flickering fluorescent light.

<b>                           JEFF
</b>               Listen, your first time, take a half.
               Okay? No more. You gotta ease into

</b>               And anyone finds these, you didn't get

       machine.

<b>                            SALVADOR
</b>                Which one do you use?

       Miguel eyes the bleach.    Can't help himself.

</b>                That one.

       THE CAMERA eerily floats toward and around Miguel on the mound.
       He stares down the HITTER, totally focused. He touches his
       cross, whispers a prayer to himself.

       Winds up, throws, and...

<b>       THUD!
</b>
       ...a cloud of dust pops off the catcher's mitt, just like the
       old days. Miguel's "stuff" is back. And he knows it.

C161   IN THE DUGOUT. There's an intensity we haven't seen before in C161
       Miguel. We get the sense he's treating this game like it could
       be his last.

       CLOSE ON MIGUEL.    Sweating more than he should at this point in
       the game, but...

       ...who cares? He continues to dominate opposing hitters,
       striking out two more in the 2nd.

       Still sweating, Miguel is now shifting his jaw back-and-forth.
       The SOUND FADES LOW, as he stares onto the field, sees...

       ...the teams changing sides between innings, everyone moving in
       subtle SLOW-MOTION (36 fps).

       Stu approaches Miguel, puts his hand on his shoulder. We see
       him mouth the words, "You okay?", but NO SOUND comes out.

       Miguel nods, yes.

       And back in real time (24 fps). Miguel fires his first pitch
       over the head of his catcher and all the way to the backstop.
       Orlando motions for him to calm down.

       The next pitch is closer, but still high.

       And the next pitch BEANS the hitter in the thigh.

       Miguel swears at himself, tries hard to calm down, but his heart
       is racing.

       Orlando nods, encouraging.      Throws the ball back.

       Miguel takes another deep breath. He whispers a prayer to
       himself, grabs the ball in his spike curve grip, and...

       ...his next pitch is ROCKED to deep left field.

       Miguel immediately lowers his head, unable to watch. We HOLD on
       his anguished reaction, as the hitter circles the bases.

       STU shakes his head in disappointment.

E164   MIGUEL does his best to shake it off, but he keeps muttering toE164

       This one almost finds the batter's head, as he falls to the dirt
       to avoid contact. It's on.

       The batter leaps to his feet, walks out toward the mound,
       pointing his finger at Miguel, PISSED.

       Miguel opens his arms, inviting a fight.     Orlando steps between
       them.

      Miguel and the batter continue jawing at each other, while the
      other players swirl around them, creating little sub-conflicts
      of their own. It's a mess.

      The sound FADES TO SILENCE and the image blends to SLO-MO again.
      There's something poetic about a bunch of men in child-like
      baseball uniforms, screaming at each other in silence.

      Miguel looks around, perhaps recognizing this for himself...
      Hold, until...

      ...he calmly walks off the field, leaving the chaos behind.

      Helen turns off the faucet, turns around. Earl methodically
      sets down his mug, stands up, and crosses to Miguel. Puts his
      arm around his shoulder, wherein...

       Similar to an earlier sequence of JUMPCUTS on Miguel reacting to

       to gauge what might be happening on the field.

       nice play.

       PLAY 2: The fans jump to their feet as a ground ball passes
       through frame, followed by an outfielder in hot pursuit.

       PLAY 3: A reliever warms up in the foreground. Miguel stares
       ahead, deadpan, while the others chat and spit chewing tobacco.

       leaving only two others with Miguel.

      fans sing along to "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

      PLAY 8: Another reliever runs out onto the field, leaving only
      Miguel and one other guy.

      PLAY 9:   Miguel is finally warming up, ready to enter the game,
      but...

      ...the fans leap to their feet, CHEERING victoriously. Game
      over. The only other reliever grabs his jacket, and heads out
      onto the field.

      As the players and fans   head for the exits, Miguel remains on
      the bullpen mound for a   beat. He nods to himself, oddly at
      peace with the moment.    Miguel steps off the mound and we PAN
      with him, as he crosses   frame, and makes the long walk to the
      dugout. Hold.

</b>               Here, I'll load your bag.

      Miguel grips his bag tighter and the two of them lock eyes.
      Salvador senses his intensity, releases the bag. Miguel backs
      away with Salvador looking on.

      AT THE CLUBHOUSE ENTRANCE Miguel turns back to the bus, sees...

      ...Salvador eyeing him from the open bus window.   Sal raises his
      hand, very subtly waves goodbye.

      Miguel continues on his way.

      A local taxi pulls up, and Miguel hops out with his duffel bag.

</b>
      Miguel steps on, moves past the other PASSENGERS, finds an empty
      seat towards the back. He sits down, catches his breath, and
      whispers a prayer to himself. When he's done, he looks across
      the aisle, where an OLD LADY is staring at him.

      He shoots her a cautious smile.

      landscapes, daytime into evening...

      From the New Jersey turnpike, Miguel sees the approaching
      Manhattan skyline in the early morning light. He sits up
      straight, looks attentively at the city emerging in the
      distance.

      Morning COMMUTERS push past Miguel, as he looks around, lost in
      the cacophony of the swirling rush hour environment.

      He locates a giant subway map on the wall, the various subway
      lines reaching into the outer boroughs like colorful tentacles.
      His eyes scan the map, and we follow his finger up the green
      line's numbered stations, stopping on 161ST/YANKEE STADIUM.

      Miguel smiles.

      AT THE TURNSTILES. Miguel inches forward, observes people
      passing through after swiping cards. He notices a line behind a
      Metrocard vending machine nearby.

<b>178   AT THE MACHINE - SECONDS LATER                                    178

      Fortunately, there is a Spanish option, so after a few touches
      and BEEPS, he's got his card.

<b>179   AT THE TURNSTILE                                                  179
</b>
      He swipes the card, tries to pass through, but the turnstile
      won't budge. He studies the message: "SWIPE AGAIN AT THIS
      TURNSTILE", but can't make sense of it. Miguel tries again,
      this time very slowly, but still can't get through.

      An IMPATIENT COMMUTER behind him SIGHS loudly.

      Miguel steps out of the way, let's the commuter pass.

      After the commuter goes through, Miguel tries again.

      the various Times Square subway lines, he sees...

      ground. He stands, looks out the window as the train passes
      Yankee Stadium.

      Miguel descends from the elevated subway station, glances
      around. The atmosphere is immediately more familiar, as PEOPLE
      walk by speaking Spanish; MERENGUE blasts out of an open
      apartment window; Dominican flags hang from others.

      Miguel paces up the block, looking for something.    He smiles
      when he finds...

      ...El Restaurante Caribe. A HELP WANTED sign (in English and
      Spanish) hangs in the window.

      REYNA (cute, 20-something, Dominican).

                His old one isn't working.

      Reyna shrugs, looks to Rafael.

      Miguel glances up at the dozens of high-rise apartment buildings
      in every direction.

      He walks away, discouraged.

      Miguel continues to follow the elevated subway tracks, which
      lead him straight to...

      ...YANKEE STADIUM. He looks up at the park's grand exterior
      with wonder. Approaches to get a closer look.

      The Stadium is closed today, so Miguel struggles to catch a
      glimpse of the field through an iron fence. He grabs hold of
      the bars, attempts to climb just enough to get a better view,
      but...

       With his duffel on his lap, Miguel sits on a bench overlooking a
       a community baseball field, where local KIDS play for fun. He
       stares off blankly, preoccupied with other things.

       Miguel sidesteps a nodding JUNKY on his way to the front desk,
       approaches the toothless Russian clerk, NIKOLAI (late 50s).

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                One room.

       As Miguel tries to piece together what was just said, he notices
       a rack of condoms beside a set of long distance calling cards on
       the front desk. The name of the calling card is ALÓ MAMÁ!

       Miguel reaches for the calling card.

       As Miguel looks for his room, he passes another room's doorway,
       where a middle-aged JOHN gives a woman a kiss goodbye. Miguel
       makes brief eye contact with the woman, RAQUEL. She smiles.

       Miguel turns on the light to find a small bed in the corner of
       the room. There's also a desk with a phone. Miguel puts down
       his duffel and sits at the desk. He examines the calling card
       for a beat, then goes to the window, looks out. Hold.

      outside a WOODEN CABINET STORE, where 5-6 Dominican men, ranging
      in age from 20 to 50 years old, make furniture in the shop. He
      stops for a beat, watching the men work.

</b>               I just moved here, you know, and I

Miguel laughs.

      begins folding.

      the counter in front of him. She smiles, keeps folding.

      Miguel sorts through the items: socks, underwear, t-shirts. He
      looks back to her, then begins folding, as the laundromat's

      She forces the bag into his hands, kisses him on the cheek, and
      retreats into her own room.

      Miguel closes the door, still holding the bag. He sets it on
      his bed, stares at it. After a few beats, he grabs it, stuffs
      it under the bed, out of sight.

      He sits down at the desk, stares at the bed, when he hears
      SHOUTING from the hall. Again, he goes to the door, listens.

      Another MAN POUNDS on Raquel's door, SCREAMING in Ukrainian,
      while Nikolai YELLS at the man in English, though Miguel can't
      make out exactly what's going on. The shouting intensifies
      until a SCUFFLE breaks out. A woman SCREAMS. Miguel reaches
      for the door handle, but stops himself.

      He steps into his BATHROOM, shuts the door, sits on the toilet.
      The muffled SHOUTING continues. Miguel waits.

</b>               I did some research and I got a new
               favorite player now.

<b>                             MIGUEL
</b>               Okay, good.

<b>                             OSVALDO
</b>               Vic Power.    You know him?

      Miguel shakes his head, no.

<b>                           OSVALDO
</b>               You ought to. Greatest Puerto Rican
               first baseman ever. But that's not why
               he's my favorite player... Back when he
               first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing
               in the minors. Little Rock, Arkansas.
               So the story goes, one day before a
               game, Vic stops into this diner for
               lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he
               knew very little English. Didn't even
               notice the "whites only" sign hanging
               in the window. And Vic was Black. I
               looked him up on Google. I mean Black
               like you. So he sits down at the
               counter and the little waitress comes
               up to big Vic and says, "I'm sorry, we
               don't serve colored people."

      Osvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella
      eagerly await what comes next.

<b>                           OSVALDO
</b>               So he leans close to the waitress,
               tells her in his best English, "That's
               okay, I don't eat colored people."

      After a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure.   Osvaldo
      does his best to explain the joke in Spanish.

      We TILT UP from his cleats to reveal Miguel looking in for the
      sign from his catcher. He nods. And delivers.

The ball is SMACKED toward third, where Jorge makes an awkward
lunge for the ball, manages to stop it with his foot. By the
time he gets his hand on it, the RUNNER has made it to first.

The fans and some of the players laugh at Jorge's ugly mistake.

        This ain't soccer! You can use your
        hands!

<b>                    MIGUEL
</b>             (smiling)
        Just like old times.

But Jorge shrugs and laughs it off.   No pressure here.   It's
only a game.

Miguel buckles down, delivers a monster fastball.

He gets the ball back, looks to the stands, and sees...

...Monica waving to Jorge at third.

Miguel's new friend, Osvaldo, is also there with Estella.
Miguel smiles to them.

Miguel fires in the next pitch, even faster, and the batter
swings straight through it.

He gets the ball back, lowers his head and whispers a prayer to
himself. Looks back to the runner on second. Comes to the set
position, and...

...floats in a vicious, swooping, knuckle curve, that causes the
batter to flinch out of the way, before breaking back over the
plate for...

<b>                    UMPIRE
</b>        Strike three!

All the fans and players in attendance go NUTS over the awesome
pitch, as we follow Miguel off the field to a mini-standing
ovation. He tips his hat to the crowd. Just like old times.

      Miguel takes a seat as TEAMMATES pass through the frame and pat
      him on the back.

      The SOUND FADES LOW as we start a SLOW ZOOM IN on Miguel. He
      takes in the moment as we get closer, and his smile gives way to
      a beat of quiet introspection. Hold.

      He looks out across the field.   CLAPS for encouragement.
