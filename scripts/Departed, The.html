</b>                       Years ago, we had the Church. That
                       was only a way of saying we had
                       each other. The Knights of Columbus
                       were head-breakers. They took over
                       their piece of the city.

          where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores
          with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island.

                       couldn't get a job, we had the
                       presidency. That's what the niggers
                       don't realize. If I got one thing
                       against the black chaps it's this.

<b>          
</b>          The frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a
          hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener.
          His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's
          probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world
          as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a
          different world and his survival in this one depends on close
          continual observation and analysis.
<b>          
</b>          YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or
          fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish.
<b>          
</b>          COSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working
          behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and,
          strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits
          for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter.

<b>          
</b>          The PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN

</b>          COSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread
          and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin's bag.

</b>                       Hi, Captain. And our primary
                       target is obviously Frank Costello.
                       But we don't communicate with
                       anyone else in this shop. Queenan
                       is compartmentalizing everything in
                       SIU. It's the right thing to do,
                       personally I don't trust these
                       fucking troopers either. We think
                       we might have a problem. We think
                       Costello's got a rat in the State
                       Police.

</b>                       You know if your father were alive
                       and saw you, sitting here with me,
                       let's say he would have a word with
                       me about this, in fact, he'd kill
                       seven guys just to cut my throat.
                       And he could do it, which is
                       something you may not know about
                       William Costigan, Sr.

                       wanted money. You can't do a thing
                       with a man like that. Your uncle
                       Jackie needed a lot of money. But
                       even though he got his money from
                       me, he also would kill my entire
                       fucking family if he saw me here
                       with you. And I think about this.

</b>                    Costello recorded everything. He
                    put all the tapes in a little box
                    and kept them with his lawyer. That
                    was his insurance. His lawyer came
                    to me. Costello trusted me the
                    most. Imagine that you rat fuck.
                    Sound quality good enough? I was a
                    little worried.

</b>          COLIN has been cleaned up a little by paramedics. He's maybe
          had his lip stitched, but he's still wearing his bloody
          clothes.

</b>                       At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who
                       I now understand to have been
                       Francis Costello's informer in SIU,
                       intercepted us in the lobby and
                       shot Trooper William Costigan once
                       in the head.
                           (drinks water)
                       At that time Barrigan retrieved
                       Trooper Costigan's undercover
                       weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he
                       was approaching our location. I
                       attempted to subdue Trooper
                       Barrigan and in the ensuing
                       struggle was struck several times
                       with the Walther pistol. I was
                       able to wrestle the weapon away, at
                       which time Barrigan drew his own
                       weapon and took aim at me. I was
                       able to get off a single shot,
                       striking Barrigan in the head. I
                       then checked for vital signs of
                       Troopers Brown and Costigan and
                       discovered that they had expired.

</b><b>          INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING
</b><b>          
</b>          COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the
          Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a
          neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who
          incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN
          briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit
          French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and
          nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and
          sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows,
          DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the
          right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has
          plastic hospital boots on his feet.
<b>          
</b><b>                                   COLIN
</b>                             (accepting it, sort of,
                              but only in a COLIN way)
<b>                       OK.
</b><b>          
</b>          DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor.
          DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half
          dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive
          staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The
          strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the
          dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so
          it's not in the shot when it
