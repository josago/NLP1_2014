        Things we notice.

        --  She makes a sour face.

        --  She walks in place.

        --  She puts one hand in her pocket and makes a fist with the other.

        --  While she is doing this, she blinks with both eyes.

        --  She is wearing a red wig.

        At one point during this Cole adds a sentence.

<b>                                  DESMOND
</b>                        Lil was wearing a sour face.

<b>                                  STANLEY
</b>                        What do you mean?

<b>                                  DESMOND
</b>                        Her face had a sour look...  that means
                        we're going to have trouble with the
                        local authorities.  They are not going to
                        be receptive to the FBI.

<b>        ON LIL BLINKING BOTH EYES
</b>
<b>                                  DESMOND
</b>                        Both eyes blinking means there is going
                        to be trouble higher up...  the eyes of the
                        local authority.  A sheriff and a deputy.
                        That would be my guess.  Two of the
                        local law enforcers are going to be a
                        problem.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        If you noticed she had one hand in her
                        pocket which means they are hiding
                        something, and the other hand made a
                        fist which means they are going to be

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        Lil was walking in place which means
                        there's going to be a lot of legwork
                        involved.

<b>        WE SEE COLE PUTTING HIS FINGERS IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AND SAYING LIL
</b><b>        IS HIS SISTER'S GIRL.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        Cole said Lil was "his mother's sister's
                        girl".  What is missing in that sentence?
                        The Uncle.

<b>                                  STANLEY
</b>                        Oh, the uncle is missing.

<b>                                  DESMOND
</b>                        Not Cole's Uncle but probably the
                        sheriff's uncle in federal prison.

<b>                                  STANLEY
</b>                        So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's
                        committed a serious crime.

<b>        ON LIL'S RED WIG
</b>
<b>                                  DESMOND
</b>                        Right, which is probably why Lil was
                        wearing a red wig meaning we are
                        headed into a dangerous situation.  Let
                        me ask you something, Stanley, did you
                        notice anything about the dress?

</b>                        The dress she was wearing had been
                        altered to fit her.  I noticed a different
                        colored thread where the dress had been
                        taken in.  It wasn't her dress or she
                        must have lost some weight.

<b>                                  DESMOND
</b>                        Gordon said you were good.  The tailored
                        dress is our code for drugs.  Did you
                        notice what was pinned to it?

<b>                                  STANLEY

</b>                        Very good, but I can't tell you about
                        that.

        Stanley rides along quietly for a while.

<b>                                  STANLEY

        Desmond stays standing and Stanley sits.  After another long moment,
        Cliff joins the SECRETARY in a conspiratorial giggle over the long
        wait they are planning to give the FBI.  In the middle of a giggle
        Cliff smiles up at Desmond.

                        Why don't you have some of that coffee.
                        It was fresh two days ago.

        Cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary
        pretending to look at some paper work.  They both laugh.

<b>                                  DESMOND
</b>                        Okay, that's it.  I've had enough of the
                        waiting room now.

                        Oh.

        Desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to Sheriff
        Cable's office.

        Cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to
        do something.  While they stare eye to eye, Desmond's hand goes up
        slowly towards Cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way.  Cliff tries
        to knock Chet's hand away.  Chet counters by grabbing Cliff's nose
        and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great amount
        of pain.

<b>                        AAAHHHHHHHH...

        Desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of
        the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down into a
        chair.

        While the Deputy's eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the secretary.

<b>                                  DESMOND

                        right now.

        Desmond stalks to Sheriff Cable's office.  Stanley remains behind
        continuing to observe every detail.

<b>15.     INT.  SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY

        SHERIFF CABLE looks up from his work.

        Cliff, still holding his nose, appears just behind Desmond, who turns
        to him.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable
                        can take it from here

        Cable signals Cliff to leave.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        I'm here to investigate the murder of

</b>                        Well, little fella, let me put it this way.
                        The operative word here would be
                        "Federal".  With or without the
                        semantics of all this, I am now ordering

                        concerning Teresa Banks, both while
                        living and deceased.

        Cable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects.
        He throws it to Desmond.

        As Desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed Newspaper
        clipping with picture.

        The caption reads:

<b>                            "CABLE BENDS STEEL"
</b>
        The newspaper shows a picture of Cable in a He-Man pose bending a
        steel BAR into a U shape.  He turns to leave and Stanley seems to
        have appeared right on time.  Desmond moves down the hall and Stanley
        follows.

<b>16.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
</b>
        As Desmond and Stanley walk to the adjoining morgue they see a pile of
        steel BARS similar to the one they saw Cable bending in the picture.

<b>        AT THE MORGUE DOOR
</b>
        Stanley moves up to Desmond and speaks confidentially.

<b>                                  STANLEY

                        worth 27,000 dollars.

        Desmond doesn't know what to say to him.  They enter the morgue.

<b>17.     INT.  TINY MORGUE - DAY

        Teresa's body is on the platform in the middle of the room,  Stanley
        hangs his recorder on the hooks at the end of the autopsy table and
        puts on rubber gloves.  Desmond opens Teresa Banks file.

                        Trailer Park for a month.  We'll check
                        that.  And worked as a waitress at Hap's
                        Truck Stop.  Worked the Night Shift.

                          (flips to another page)
                        No one came to claim the body and no
                        known next of kin.

        As Desmond is doing this, Stanley takes out his SPECIAL MACHINE.
        Desmond looks up from his work and notices.

</b>                        Sure, but let's finish up with this first.

        Getting to work, Stanley's face goes right over Teresa's.

                        looks to be between 16 and 18 years of

</b>                        I wonder where her ring is?

                        Personal effects include a watch, under
                        garments, and a blue waitress
                        uniform...  the ring is missing.  It says
                        the rest of her things haven't been
                        removed yet from the trailer.  Let's

</b>                        A laceration.

        Stanley brings over his "Whiteman" instrument.  Works the left hand
        under it.

        Desmond and Stanley talk with JACK, the manager who has black wavy
        hair with a black full mustache to match, shiny silk shirt with silver
        strands sown in and an Indian turquoise belt.  He has a sign on his
        shirt that says, "Say 'Goodbye' to JACK".

        A GUY in the room is working on a light that keeps buzzing and
        shorting out.  He doesn't really know what he's doing so he is
        poking at the wiring.

        A WOMAN sticks her head into the trailer.  She has an ice pack over
        one eye and a load of idle curiosity.  Desmond notices her.

        Desmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches Cliff get
        into his car and drive to work.

        Stepping away from the trailer Desmond spots something underneath.
        He bends down and retrieves a Titleist Golf Ball.

        He reaches out and stops Stanley from going out to get the body.
        Cable smiles menacingly at Desmond.

                             CABLE (continued)
                        Cliff told me you asked him the same

        Desmond takes his coat and badge off.  Cable takes his shirt off and
        Desmond follows.  Cable is bare-chested and Desmond is in FBI issue
        underwear.

        Desmond goes to pick up an iron bar and Cable hits him with a sucker
        punch.  As Desmond bends away from this Cable rushes at him.  Desmond
        stops him with a few well placed punches to his face.  Cable falls
        down and Desmond stands over him.  Chet picks up the steel bar and
        bends it.  He then tosses the bar away.

        Cable stands up and rushes at Desmond who flips and flops him around.
        Cable tries one more grand roadhouse punch which Desmond expertly
        ducks.

        Carl walks away towards his trailer.  Desmond walks over and around
        Cliff's red trailer.  He gets a strange feeling.  He looks past
        Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a
        HAND appear in the window of a trailer.  Then the hand disappears.

        Desmond walks to that trailer.  He knocks on the door but no one
        answers.  He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_

                                 (a laugh)
                        Another triumph for the dashing Agent
                        Cooper.  And you, Diane, now have to
                        clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground
                        coffee from Sally and make a damn
                        great pot of coffee.

        Cooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join Cole and Albert.
        But Cole's stern look takes his smile away.

<b>36.     INT.  SAM STANLEY'S APARTMENT, SPOKANE - DAY
</b>
        All around the walls of Stanley's apartment are work benches with
        adding machinery sitting on top of them.  In the middle of the room
        is a portable plastic pool, with milky white water and crystallized
        salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks.  From one
        odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the
        pool.

        Cooper's eyes go to the pool and back to Stanley as Sam talks about
        Desmond.

                        drive the van with the body back here.
                        Which we did.  It was 105 miles.

                        had his own M.O.

        Stanley turns to one of his work tables and shows Cooper the Whiteman
        machine.

<b>                                  STANLEY
</b>                        I cracked the Whiteman case with this.

                        under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.

        Cooper looks under the microscope to see the letter they found on
        Teresa.

        Cooper starts walking in the opposite direction from Cliff's trailer
        picking up on the same odd vibe that struck Desmond.

                        God damn, you people are confusing.

        Cooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks.

                        and who stayed in the trailer?

<b>                                   CARL
</b>                        An old woman and her grandson.

</b>                        Can you tell me what their names were?

<b>                                   CARL
</b>                        Chalfont.  Weird.  Chalfont was the

                        before they did.  Two Chalfonts.

        Cooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer.
        As he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence
        of SOMETHING.

        Cooper struggles to his feet and looks around.  Under a tree and
        close to the tracks is a car.

<b>                                  COOPER
</b>                        Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?

</b>                        Yep, it sure is.

        Cooper walks to it.

<b>        AT DESMOND'S CAR
</b>
        Cooper inspects the car.  Coming around to the front of the car he
        notices the windshield.  On the windshield someone has written the
        words, "Let's Rock".

<b>38.     EXT.  WIND RIVER, NEAR DEER MEADOW - AFTERNOON

                        Diane, it's 4:20 in the afternoon.  I am
                        standing here at Wind River where they
                        found the body of Teresa Banks.  Diane,
                        this case has got a strange feeling for
                        me.  Not only has Agent Chester
                        Desmond disappeared but this is one of
                        Cole's Blue Rose cases.  The clues that
                        were found by Agent Desmond and Agent
                        Stanley have lead to dead ends.  The
                        letter below the fingernail gives me the
                        feeling that the killer will strike again.
                        But like the song says, "...who knows
                        where or when".

                        The diary was hidden too well.  He's the

        She allows the feeling of Bob to come over her and she begins to
        scream.  Harold steps back, but Laura grabs him.  To his face with
        a horrifying expression on hers.

        handshake.

        Laura comes out of the kitchen stacking some of her "Meals on Wheels"
        on the counter.

        On screen it reads:

<b>                        "FRIDAY - SIX DAYS BEFORE"
</b>
        NORMA JENNINGS and SHELLY JOHNSON watch from the cash register.
        Shelly is ringing someone out, handing back their change.

</b>                        Shelly, would you give Laura a quick
                        hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?

<b>                                  SHELLY
</b>                        I'm kind of busy, Norma.

</b>                        You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.

        With a little squeeze of the hand and a gentle shove, Norma moves
        Shelly towards Laura who is at the end of the counter.

        The door opens to the Diner and ED and NADINE HURLEY come in.  Nadine
        stops when she sees Norma.

<b>                                  NADINE
</b>                        I changed my mind, I don't want any
                        coffee, Eddie.

        Nadine goes out.  As she walks past Ed he looks at Norma and makes a
        "What can I do" gesture.

<b>                                    ED
</b>                        Sorry, Norma.

        Ed goes out.

        Shelly approaches sheepishly.

<b>                                  SHELLY
</b>                        Can I give you a hand getting the dinners

</b>                        Okay.  You can help me carry them to the
                        car.

        Shelly gathers up a pile of the dinners and takes them out to the
        "Meals on Wheels" car.

<b>88.     EXT.  THE DOUBLE R - DAY
</b>
        Shelly loads her stuff in the back.  She returns to the diner and
        Laura follows doing the same.

        As Laura places her dinners in the back something catches her eye and
        she turns.

<b>        LAURA'S POV
</b>
        Mrs. Tremond and her grandson are standing in the parking lot staring
        at Laura.  Mrs. Tremond waves to Laura to come over.  When Laura comes
        to them Mrs. Tremond holds out a framed picture.

<b>                                  TREMOND
</b>                        This would look nice on your wall.

        She hands Laura the picture.  It is a picture of a room with flowered
        wallpaper and a dark doorway in its corner.  Laura's study of it is
        interrupted by the grandson.

<b>                                 GRANDSON
</b>                        He's looking for a book with pages torn
                        out.  He's walking towards the hiding
                        place.  He's moving under the fan now.

<b>        ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
        Shelly comes out of the Diner with another load of meals.  Laura turns
        back to her and then back to the Tremonds, who are walking away from
        her and are farther away than they realistically could be.  Laura
        comes to Shelly in a panic.

<b>                                   LAURA
</b>                        Shelly, you really can help me.  I can't
                        do the "Meals on Wheels" today.  I just
                        can't.

<b>                                  SHELLY
</b>                        Okay.

        Laura runs off.  Shelly puts her load into the car as she watches
        Laura.

</b>                        Laura just took off.  She asked me to do
                        the run today.  Should I do it?

<b>                                   NORMA

                        take a look around.  There's no one here
                        anyway.

<b>                                  SHELLY

</b>                        Norma, are you alright?

        Norma just turns away and picks up some dirty dishes.

<b>                                   NORMA
</b>                        Come back as soon as you can.

</b>                        If Leo comes here, he won't believe that

</b>                        Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.

        Shelly leaves the diner.

<b>        ON NORMA
</b>
        In the empty diner Norma walks over and sits in a booth.  She studies
        the empty diner.  After a while the cook, TOAD, calls from the
        kitchen.  A distant forlorn call.

<b>                                   TOAD
</b>                        Kind of quiet.

<b>        CLOSEUP:  ON NORMA
</b>
        She starts to cry.

<b>90.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY

        Laura runs home.  Holding the picture from Mrs. Tremond throughout.

</b>                            (frantic whispers)
                        He's looking for the book, he's going to
                        the hiding place!

<b>        LAURA'S POV
</b>
        She stops and stares.  Her house suddenly looks very frightening to
        her.  She slowly crosses her front yard and enters the house.

<b>91.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY
</b>
        Laura comes in the front door still holding the picture.  She crosses
        thru the dining room.

<b>92.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, STAIRS - DAY
</b>
        Laura moves ever so slowly up the stairs - the fan still and silent
        above her.

        At the top of the stairs, she stops and stares at her bedroom door.
        Her whole body is shaking.  Her hand goes out in front of her.  She
        touches her bedroom door and inches it open.

<b>93.     INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
        The opening of the door reveals more and more of her room.  Suddenly
        it reveals Bob standing in her room at her dresser.  He has pulled
        the dresser away from the wall looking for something.

<b>        ON BOB
</b>
        He is frozen.  Smiling at her.

<b>        ON THE SCENE
</b>
        With a scream, Laura bolts from her room.

<b>94.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - SAME
</b>
        Laura races out of the house still holding Tremond's picture.

<b>95.     EXT.  PALMER'S NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE
</b>
        Laura runs across two yards to a large tree and falls to her knees,
        crying.  She looks up and sees her father come out the front door of
        her house.  She watches him cross to his car and drive away.

<b>                                   LAURA

                        What?  It can't be...  It can't be him...  no...
                        no...

        Laura is coming apart, sobbing.  Behind her, on the sidewalk,
        a NEIGHBOR has noticed her.

<b>                                   WOMAN
</b>                        Laura...

        A closer look reveals how upset Laura is.

<b>                                   WOMAN
</b>                        What...  Laura are you all right?

        Laura turns away so the woman can't see her crying.  The woman takes
        a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass.

<b>                                   LAURA
</b>                       (trying to hold it together)
                        I...  lost my necklace...  it must have
                        fallen.

        Laura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace.  She
        pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already
        around her neck.

<b>                                   LAURA

                        Oh, here it is.

        Woman moves back to the sidewalk.

<b>                                   WOMAN
</b>                        Well, I'm glad you found it, darling.

        Slowly, Laura stands and moves away - leaving Mrs. Tremond's picture
        on the grass under the tree.

<b>96.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE
</b>
        Laura stands in front of her house.  Terrified.

        No Bob.  Listens to the house...  stands in the entrance way.

<b>98.     LIVING ROOM - SAME

        Laura listens.  Hears nothing.

<b>99.     STAIRS AND HALLWAY

        She stops and stares at the fan then slowly makes her way up the
        stairs towards her room.

<b>100.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - SAME

        No Bob in her room.  The dresser is back in its place.  Laura races
        out.

        Laura runs down the sidewalk.

        The girls exchange glances about what Dad is doing as they chew on

        From across the table Leland looks at her fingernails.  He stands to

                        And look at this.

        He reaches for it.  Laura's hand flies up and stops him.  Leland's
        other hand comes up and she lets him take the HALF HEART out.

        Leland sits stoically.  Laura rises from the table.

        He leaves the room.  Laura watches the door close.  She sits frozen
        for a moment, with a tear in her eye, then she remembers something.

        We hold on the picture.  As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move
        into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark
        doorway in the room in the picture.

        On the other side of the dark doorway there is another room.
        Mrs. Tremond is standing in that room.  She is beckoning us towards
        her and beyond her thru yet another doorway.  We move thru the second
        doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room.

        Mrs. Tremond's grandson is standing in that room.  He is holding his
        hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball.  As we
        move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there
        and we move thru that into...

<b>113.    INT.  RED ROOM

        The MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE walks into the red room to a table.
        A ring lies upon the table.

        COOPER ENTERS THE RED ROOM.  The Man From Another Place turns toward
        Cooper.

        The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and
        makes an Indian Whooping sound.

        The Man From Another Place picks up the ring and moves it very close
        to us.  We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring.  The symbols on the
        ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave.

        Cooper seems concerned.

        fills the screen.

<b>114.    BACK IN LAURA'S ROOM

        Laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise.  She tries
        to move her left arm, but it has fallen asleep.  She moves it with
        her right arm.

        It sounds as if someone is calling her name.

<b>        ON LAURA

        She turns to her right to see who it is, then turning back to her left
        she discovers ANNIE BLACKBURN lying in bed with her.  Annie has blood
        around her mouth.  She tries to raise herself and strains to speak.

<b>        ON LAURA'S DOOR
</b>
        Her mother calls her name.  The sound is distant and mournful.

<b>        ON LAURA
</b>
        Laura looks towards her door then turns back to Annie but she is gone.
        Filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is Teresa Banks' ring.
        SHE SCREAMS.  Again, her attention is drawn to her door and her
        mother's distant call.  Still holding the ring she gets out of bed
        and goes to her door and slowly opens it.

        It is dark on the other side of the door.

<b>        AT THE DOORWAY OF LAURA'S BEDROOM

        In the doorway Laura gets a strange feeling in back of her and turns
        to look at Mrs. Tremond's picture.  There in the picture is Laura
        (herself) in the doorway looking back into the darkened rooms where
        Mrs. Tremond and her grandson were.

        in her hand and the ring is gone.

        Laura gets out of bed and goes to Mrs. Tremond's picture hanging on
        the wall.  She stares at it.  She slowly takes it off the wall and
        places it in the trash.  Trembling she does two lines of cocaine.

        As Laura comes in she makes eye contact with Jacques Renault who is
        behind the bar.  Laura sits at a table.

        Jacques nods to a COUPLE of BURLY TRUCKERS who come over to Laura
        with drinks.  One of them slides her a fifty with a packet of cocaine

        The trucker turns a couple of shades towards white.  Donna comes in
        just as a beautiful song of lost love begins.

        Laura and Donna see each other -- As the truckers toss down bourbons
        and beer chasers, Laura gets _lost_in_the_song_and_starts_to_cry_.
        Donna just stares at her from the other side of the Roadhouse.

        "long necks".

        Laura takes a hit of cocaine and looks up to see Donna watching.
        Buck circles Donna with his big arm and puts a toot under her nose.

        The front room is a bar and restaurant with about THREE PATRONS.
        Above the bar is a sign that reads:

        The BARTENDER presses a release underneath the counter that allows
        Laura to take her three friends thru a door over which a sign hangs
        announcing in red neon letters:

        The group enters a large room with the filthiest wall to wall carpet
        imaginable.  In the back corner is a small stage.  On it a three
        piece HELL-METAL BAND is building up toward oblivion.  The LEAD SINGER
        is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo
        head and horns.  He wears spray painted, day glow orange cowboy boots.

        Some HALF DRESSED GIRLS and COWBOYS are dancing to the band.  In
        darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the
        band to oblivion.

        Laura leans over to Donna noticing her shocked look.

        The two truckers laugh with Jacques.  He mimes a gun with his right
        hand and pointing it to his forehead pulls the trigger with a weak,
        slack cheeked puff sound.

        Laura winks at Buck as he SECRETLY drops a red depth charge into
        Donna's beer.

        As the cowboys gather around and begin to chant, both Laura and Donna
        chug down their drinks.  They finish and Laura smiles and pushes
        Donna out onto the dance floor.

        They start to dance expertly and smile at each other.  Soon Buck and
        Tommy cut in separating the two.

        Buck dances Laura over to ANOTHER of his buddies.  The two of them
        start to unbutton Laura's blouse as they dance.

        The hell-metal band kicks into high gear.  In the pulsating red and
        black light Donna sees Laura now topless dancing and kissing with
        Buck and his friend.  Donna stops.  Jacques sweeps in.

        spots Laura's blouse on the floor.  Teetering she leans over, picks
        up the blouse, and ties it around her waist.

        RONETTE PULASKI, flying high, makes her way through the crowd to

</b>                        I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in
                        Seattle.  He was digging through his
                        food with his chopsticks for about five
                        minutes till he found the fish eye and he
                        dropped it into his throat.  I guess it
                        must have gotten stuck in his uvula
                        because right away he started to have
                        trouble.  His throat began to flutter
                        there like there was a wind blowing.
                        And he couldn't swallow and they rushed
                        to him and loosened his collar and they
                        were asking him if he was alright and
                        he started to turn blue and his eyes
                        started to roll back into his head and he
                        still couldn't get the fish eye out and
                        they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver.  I
                        went over to him as they were
                        preparing to do an emergency
                        tracheotomy.  They were over him with
                        a knife when he suddenly shot the fish
                        eye out of his throat and right onto the
                        ceiling.  Splat!  It just stuck up there
                        and spread out.  It was about the size of
                        a half dollar.  And that's why I don't ever
                        eat fish eyes.

        He plays the guitar for Josie.  Then stops.

                        I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's
                        just the way I feel.  It's the custom
                        thing I was thinking of.  In America we
                        don't use any part of the fish but the
                        meat just to the side of the insides.  We
                        throw away the tail, the rest of the
                        insides and the head.

<b>145.    INT.  LELAND'S CAR - DAY
</b>
        Leland and Laura drive along.  Leland becomes preoccupied with
        something in his rear view mirror.  Laura turns to see a car
        erratically coming up behind them.  Leland slows down and stops for
        a red light at Sparkwood and Twenty One.  In front of them is a huge
        logging truck.  Laura smells something.

</b>                        Dad, is the engine on fire?  Something
                        is burning.

        Leland turns and gives her a look.

        The car that was tailing them races around them, races around the
        logging truck, and comes back around stopping on Leland's side of
        the car.

        Leland spots Gerard, the one armed man, behind the wheel - sweating
        like crazy.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Something is burning.

        Leland starts to rev his engine while holding the brake with his left
        foot.

                        above the store.

        Leland is panicked.  The car is slowly screeching towards the large
        lumber truck in front of them.

                        opened.  There was a closeness.  Like
                        the formica table top.

        The car is now smoking and making a horrendous sound.  Gerard
        continues to yell, but we can barely hear it.

                        thread will be torn.

        Leland turns to Laura.  Sweat pours from his forehead.

        While Leland is turned away, Gerard holds up his hand with a ring on
        the little finger.  He is shouting over the engine noise and the horn
        which Leland has begun to blow frantically.

        Laura can't make this out over the noise.

        The light turns green.  Gerard takes off away from them.  As soon as
        the logging truck moves Leland lets go of the brake and the car flies
        into a service station on their right.  Everyone around there has been
        watching a commotion on a Sunday afternoon.

        Laura turns and sees the woods.  It pulls her.  She releases her hold
        on James and runs into the waiting darkness.

        The red light swings in the wind above James.  It turns green, but he
        doesn't move.  When the light turns red again, James guns the engine
        and lifts the bike up on its back tire.  James screams then roars down

<b>220.    EXT.  JACQUES' CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
        Gasping for breath Gerard arrives at the cabin too late.  He stares
        at the open doorway.  Jacques lies passed out at his feet.  Gerard
        cocks his head straining to hear something.  He hears distant screams.

<b>                                  GERARD
</b>                        Bob, I can hear you singing.

<b>221.    INT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
</b>
        Leland hauls the two girls into the train car.

        He SLIDES THE DOOR SHUT and it is completely quiet.

        BOB AND LELAND going in and out like breathing.  The two girls shudder
        in the corner as he circles them.

        Leland grabs Laura and begins to wrap the twine around her arms
        bending the arms back.

<b>                                   LAURA
</b>                                (whispers)
                        Are you going to kill me?

<b>222.    EXT.  WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
        Gerard tearing thru the woods.  The wind comes up carrying with it
        cries and screams and the sounds of BOB.

<b>223.    INT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
</b>
        Leland hoists Laura up so that she hovers facing the floor a foot
        off the ground.  He places a mirror on the floor directly under her
        face.

<b>        IN THE MIRROR
</b>
        Laura sees herself turn into Bob.  Leland screams into space.

<b>                                  LELAND
</b><b>                        DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.

</b>                        I always thought you knew it was me.

<b>                                   LAURA
</b>                         (into Bob in the mirror)
<b>                        NO!  YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.
</b>                                (to Leland)
<b>                        KILL ME.
</b>
<b>224.    EXT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
</b>
        Gerard arrives outside.  He bangs on the train door.

<b>                                  GERARD
</b><b>                        LET ME IN.  LET ME IN.
</b>
        The door opens a little bit because Ronette is pushing it with her
        feet.  Gerard reaches up to help her when suddenly she flies over
        his head having been hit.

        Ronette hits the ground, her unconscious head bent back at an odd
        angle.

<b>        ECU: GERARD
</b>
        He listens to the sounds of murder inside the train car.

<b>225.    INSIDE THE TRAIN CAR
</b>
        Laura screaming

        Knife entering flesh.

        Bob screaming.

        Bloody knife thru the air.

        Leland screaming.

<b>226.    EXT.  TRAIN CAR
</b>
<b>        ECU: GERARD
</b>
        Gerard leans in to take a look and steps back laughing.  he yells out
        for Bob to hear.

                            GERARD (continued)
<b>                        THAT'S HIS OWN DAUGHTER YOU'RE
</b><b>                        KILLING.
</b>
        He continues to laugh and runs away from the train car.

        A few moments later Leland stumbles out of the car carrying the body
        of Laura Palmer wrapped in a plastic shroud.  Leland's shirt is puffed
        out - a bloody towel inside.

<b>227.    EXT.  WOODS/RIVER - NIGHT
</b>
        Leland/Bob lowers the plastic shrouded Laura into the river.

<b>228.    EXT.  GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT
</b>
        Leland stumbles to the centre of Glastonbury Grove and stops.  A
        frightening wind carries haunting music.  He digs into his pockets
        for the pages torn from Laura's secret diary.  he tosses them and
        the bloody towel to the wind.

        He goes to the centre of the circle of the twelve sycamore trees.
        The red curtains appear and he passes between them entering the red
        Room.

<b>229.    INT.  THE RED ROOM
</b>
        It is not empty.  Gerard is just leaving the other side of the room.

        LELAND walks thru the Red Room after him.  He walks down a corridor
        and _into_the_Red_Room_again_.

        There on the other side of the room Leland sees Gerard and the Man
        From Another Place sitting side by side in a chair facing him.

        Leland stops when he sees them.  He divides.  One half becomes Bob -
        opaque.  The other half floats up and becomes Leland - transparent.

<b>        ON BOB
</b>
        He reaches up and grabs Leland's wound.

<b>        ECU - LELAND'S WOUND
</b>
        Bob heals Leland's wound.

<b>        ON THE SCENE.
</b>
        Gerard and the Man From Another Place speak in unison.

        Annie is being brought in on a stretcher.  A NURSE talks to a
        PARAMEDIC as they rush her towards the emergency room.

        The Man From Another Place stands with Cooper.

                        sound like this...

        The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and
        makes an Indian Whooping sound.

</b>
        The Man From Another Place begins to laugh uncontrollably.

<b>234.    INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
        A NURSE mops the sweat from Annie's forehead.  Annie tries to get
        thru to her.

<b>                                   ANNIE
</b>                        My name is Annie.  I've been with Laura
                        and Dale.  The good Dale is in the lodge
                        and he can't leave.  Write it in your
                        diary.

        The nurse pats Annie's forehead and takes her hand.  We see
        _TERESA/LAURA'S_RING_ on Annie's ring finger.  The nurse gently
        slides the ring off Annie's finger.

<b>235.    INT.  ANOTHER ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL
</b>
        The nurse enters.  With an anticipatory smile, then a selfish laugh,
        she puts the ring on her finger.

<b>236.    INT.  HOTEL ROOM, GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT

        Doc Hayward and Sheriff Truman watch the door of the bathroom
        anxiously.

        Not getting any response Truman breaks open the door.

<b>237.    INSIDE THE BATHROOM
</b>
        Cooper, in his pajamas, lies on the floor.  The mirror above the sink
        is shattered with blood all over it and the sink.  Cooper smiles up
        at them strangely.

                        I slipped and hit my head on the mirror.
                        The glass broke as it struck my head.
                                 (laughs)
                        It struck me as funny, Harry.  Do you
                        understand me, Harry, it struck me as
                        funny.

        Cooper smiles at the uneasy pair.

        Laura is sitting in a chair.  As the end credits begin...

        We move back to see that Laura is sitting in Cooper's lap in the
        same chair.
