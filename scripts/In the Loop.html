</b>                     (with a degree of genuine

              He might be dead. He might have had that

</b>              He did not say "unforseeable'. You may

     Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's
     pretty much full.

     KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by
     ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and
     assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's
     senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of
     advisors, smaller but sitting separately.

     Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including
     uniformed members of all three services.

     Lots of hubbub.

     SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to
     their seats.

     They're as far away from the US delegation as it's
     possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a
     pillar. Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign
     Office delegation near the front. Suzy looks over to
     Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to
     say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore
     important I am'.

     anything.

</b>                    We all agree this is a very tough time,
                    but I don't want a consensus to form

                    necessarily the primary option at this
                    point.

     Back with Simon, Judy and Toby. Simon still straining to
     see.

<b>                                 SIMON
</b>                    Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit

     Simon and Judy swap seats again.

     Back with Karen. She's holding up a paper in a red

               envision a theatre deployment for twelve
               months.

               This has been discussed in a number of

</b>                      (to Judy and Toby)
               Should I say something? She invited me, I
               should say something. If you don't say
               something in the first 10 minutes, you
               can end up not saying anything at all.

<b>                            JUDY
</b>               I don't know whether you should say
               anything.

<b>                            SIMON
</b>               I'm saying something ... I think I'm
               going to try saying something.

     Simon goes to put his hand up, Toby maybe puts a calming
     hand on his hand. They look at one another. Has Toby
     crossed a line?
<b>                            KAREN

               that Ministers in The UK Government,
                      (Liza whispers - Simon's over
                       there)
               such as our colleague here ...

<b>                            SIMON

<b>                            KAREN
</b>               Has made it clear that for them currently
               war is unforeseeable. Isn't that right
               Simon?

<b>                            SIMON
</b>               Well, yes, I mean, that's what I said.
               And I stick to what I said.

     SIMON sits down. Them stands back up.

<b>                            SIMON (CONT'D)
</b>               But that doesn't mean that what I said
               won't ever change. It's not imutable. Or
               mutable. It's an ongoing ...

               here and see how much time we have at the
               end for this discussion?

     He's ended the debate.

     Suzy comes round the back of the meeting all smiles and
     hands Judy a note with a smile.

<b>                              JUDY

     massive tit. Stop him.'

     Toby whispers something in Simon's ear. Simon doesn't
     look pleased. Karen is still talking to the meeting.

     The big meeting is breaking up. Simon is annoyed, leading
     Judy and Toby out of the room and into any private space
     he can find - they back into a huge huge ballroom

     We're with Karen Clark's delegation who have just walked
     downstairs from the meeting room into a ground floor
     lobby area. KAREN is talking to LIZA, her right-hand
     woman.

     TOBY, SIMON and JUDY are above them standing round a
     circular viewing area that looks down on the lobby.

     The UK and US delegations are aware of each other,
     throwing furtive glances each other's way.

                    citation. You must be psyched Karen
                    brought it up.

<b>                                 LIZA
</b>                    She...that was her call. I didn't know it

     glances over.

               choose to work in a glass office. In my

                    said war was unforseeable, and I think he
                    could very useful on the committee
                    because he could internationalise the
                    dissent.

     Toby's ending his call with Liza.

<b>                                 TOBY
</b>                    Attending the war committee. That's big.
                    I mean, I have been on a committee
                    before. "Challenges for the cheese
                    market" - that was a big one...
                    but...yes, sure I'd love a drink. Forty
                    minutes? Great.
                           (he does that mobile thing
                            where people sign off by
                            repeatedly saying `bye' with
                            increasing speed but
                            diminishing volume)
                    Bye bye bye-bye-bye-bye-bye bye.

     He hangs up. Very excited. Starts getting ready to see
     Liza. Checks his hair in the mirror. Not quite right. He
     opens a pot of hair gel, takes a scoop and rubs it in his
     hands, ready to put it in his hair. His phone goes again.

     Doesn't know what to do. Doesn't want to pick up the
     phone with gelly hands. No time to wash it off. Grabs a
     towel and picks up the phone holding the towel. He
     struggles to press the answer button. Puts the towel-
     covered phone to his ear.

     He can't hear through the towel. Tries to adjust it.

</b>               So, welcome to this, somewhat engorged
               session of the Future Planning Committee.
               You can all see an agenda?

     People are looking at their agendas, low-level chatter,
     pouring of water, etc. - a general pre-meeting feel.

<b>                            KAREN
</b>               Assistant Secretary -- here on point 6,
               it feels like there's an assumption that
               we'll be invading. Should we talk about
               the practical? I mean this is the war
               committee after all?

<b>                            LINTON
</b>               It's the Future Planning Committee.

<b>                            KAREN
</b>               Unofficially it's known as the war
               committee.

<b>                            LINTON
</b>               Well, unofficially we can call anything
               whatever we like.
                      (he holds up a water glass)
               Unofficially, this is a shoe. But it's
               not a shoe, Karen, it's a glass of water,
               and this is the Future Planning
               Committee.

<b>                                 KAREN
</b>                    But what I'm asking is has a decision
                    been reached in principle to advocate
                    invasion?

<b>                                 LINTON
</b>                    That's way off agenda Karen. Although it
                    would seem a general consensus may be
                    forming.

<b>                                 KAREN
</b>                    What makes you say that?

<b>                                 LINTON
</b>                    Well I noted with interest the recent
                    comments of our colleague Simon Foster in
                    that regard.

     Simon is texting under the desk and not really paying
     full attention. He hears his name, looks up, waves to the
     group. He doesn't clock Karen's intense look that says
     `You are going to rebut that, aren't you?'

<b>                                 KAREN
</b>                    Perhaps Mr. Foster would have something
                    to say about that?

<b>                                 SIMON
</b>                           (politely)
                    I'm just...watching with interest. IN
                    Britain we have a saying for complicated
                    situations such as this, which is that
                    it's
                           (he can't believe he's going
                            to say this)
                    `Difficult, difficult, lemon, difficult.'

     He goes back to his text.

<b>                                 LINTON
</b>                    As I say it seems a consensus is forming.

<b>                                 KAREN
</b>                           (furious)
                    That's just ridiculous. You have no basis
                    for saying that.

<b>                                 LINTON
</b>                    Karen, please, calm down. We don't want
                    you to have another hemorrhage. Item One.

                    Tell him to call me. But he might not get
                    through cos I'm a fucking busy man.

     He finds himself heading into Karen's office.

     Their phones are on the table. As is a bottle of
     Sancerre. Judy's got her power walking trainers on and
     her rucksack with her.

</b>                    Cheers everyone. Here's to surviving
                    another day.

     They clink glasses.

     He goes to the bar. His phone gets a text. Suzy picks it

     puts the phone back down.

</b>               Yeah I wouldn't want to meet Jamie in a

     Toby is in the bedroom. A few boxes are lying around.
     He's putting clothes into bin liners. Suzy is hovering.
     Michael brings through some teas. The atmosphere is very
     frosty and awkward.

     down with boxes and bags and can hardly see. Comes out
     into the hall. Suzy is there without Michael.

               it'll look convincing if I did. I mean,

               the `right thing'? Nothing. Doing the
               wrong thing is braver. In a way. I mean,
               you know, wars sometimes work. The War of

      On the closed door of the Meditation Room. Malcolm
      suddenly bursts out, re-energised, ready for action. He's
      in the middle of a call.

      One of the doors he pushes open has a coffee machine in

      and scalding himself.

                Linton for allowing I Heart Huckabees on
                to the troops DVD roster. You know the
                phrase, "I'm too old for this shit? Well,
                I'm too young for this shit.

      Malcolm is walking through the open-plan office with
      Judy. In the background we see Toby getting the last of
      his things together.

      The NEW MINISTER and her ADVISOR arrive. They are almost
      carbon copies of Simon and Toby.

<b>                                  MALCOLM
</b>                     Ah, here they are. Minister. Elizabeth.
                     Welcome aboard.

<b>                                  MINISTER
</b>                     Thanks Malcolm. Looking forward to it.
                     War seems to be going `great guns' at the
                     moment.

</b>                     Ah, cheeky! Let me take you out for an
                     expensive lunch, roast swan and all the
                     trimmings, and I'll bring you up to speed
                     on the whole Middle East situation.

<b>                                  MALCOLM
</b>                     Aye, but in a friendly, non-breaky way.
                     Watch your step there. There's still
                     blood on the deck.

</b>                     Yes, it's that one there.

      She points at Toby's desk. The Minister and his advisor
      start making themselves at home.

      We stay on Toby now as Malcolm and Judy greet the new
      guys.

      Toby grabs the last of his things, glances over at them,
      and them we follow him as he heads down the front steps.
