          the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks
          up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the
          opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:

          The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A
          WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the
          end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.

          looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:

</b>          He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for
          the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar
          again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their
          colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.
<b>

          gets up, LEAVES MAX alone in the room with the ten Indians.
          Max takes a deep breath, looks up at the DEATH SQUAD.

          Pooch's wife JOLENE, doing dishes in the sink again.
<b>                         
</b>          A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously
          heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.
          Opens it and looks out to see...
<b>                         
</b>          Nothing. Not even by the swingset.
<b>

<b>                         
</b>          A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She
          steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.
          Her breath hitches in her chest.
<b>                         
</b>          A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.
<b>                         
</b>          And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she
          knows what it means.
<b>                         
</b>          Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.
