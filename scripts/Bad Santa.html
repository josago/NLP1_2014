               It looks like a warm cozy place out of "It's A Wonderful 
               Life". The window is flocked with fake snow, and hung with 
               colorful Christmas lights, wreaths and ornaments.

               The barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional 
               semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar.

               Other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional 
               glances toward the far end of the bar. It is early evening -- 
               happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable.

               A customer says something interrogative to the bartender, 
               who looks down the bar and shrugs.

               REVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT (Notes the combination 
               of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face 
               from being clearly revealed in this scene).

               Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth 
               by the other customers, a man (WILLIE) stares morosely into 
               his drink. The drink is clearly not his first.

               He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white 
               pom-pom. He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. His 
               long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below 
               his chin to facilitate drinking. It exposes heavy black 
               stubble.

               Swaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his 
               lips. Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some 
               effortful coordination. He takes a sip and sets the drink 
               carefully back down.

               After another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping.

               It is loud, dolorous, and unself-conscious.

<b>               EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND THE MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT
</b>
               Santa staggers out the back door...

               CAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HIM still hiding his face.

               Santa gets about ten feet, then pauses and leans with one 
               hand against the alley wall, uses the other to hold his pom-
               pom out of the way, and vomits.

               Having vomited, and spit, he staggers off toward the street.

               An upbeat woman TRAINER presides over a half-dozen SANTAS 
               sitting at school desks. On the blackboard the Trainer is 
               writing out the sixth "Santa Commandment".

<b>                                 SANTA'S TEN COMMANDMENTS
</b>
               1) No alcoholic beverages before or during your shift.
               2) Know the names of your reindeer.
               3) Do not smoke in your costume.
               4) No swearing.
               5) Absolutely no flirting.
               6) Coax a smile from the child.

                         Coax... a... smile... from... the 
                         child.
                              (turning to face them)
                         Remember, parents don't want photos 
                         where their child isn't smiling. 
                         Some children may not want to smile. 
                         It is your job to coax a smile out 
                         of them. A good line to remember is:
                         "Santa thinks everybody should be 
                         happy. Can you smile for Santa?" A 
                         camera can only copy a child's smile -- 
                         it will take you to put it there.

</b>                         If the child will not smile, the 
                         Photo Elf will go ahead and take the 
                         picture anyway. Now, it is a good

                         you must learn to smile with your 
                         eyes. They show warmth and can be 
                         very expressive.

               Wintry night. Ray Coniff's "Jolly Ole Saint Nicholas" scores 
               views of the downtown blanketed in snow and decorated for 
               the holiday. It is Christmas Eve, and the sidewalks throng 
               with people rushing to do their last-minute shopping.

               A MOTHER and her two absurdly bundled CHILDREN emerge from 
               the crowd.

                         She drags them across the street 
                         toward the looming art-deco monolith 
                         that is the big-city department store.

               Mother and children crest the escalator to emerge on the top 
               floor.

</b>                         There! 

               The older child is pointing at a prop gate with a candy-cane 
               letter sign: TO SANTA'S WORKSHOP.

               He runs and Mom shoos her younger child to join him.

               The boys cross the threshold of the gate and their eyes filled 
               with wonder.

               A winding path cuts through a flocked and candy-striped 
               forest, past a workshop filled with mannequin-elves busily 
               cobbling Christmas toys, and finally arriving at...

               Santa, seated on his throne like a scarlet Messiah. The 
               younger child staggers forward to join the line of a hundred 
               other leaky-nosed worshippers awaiting an audience.

               At the head of the line the next waiting child is escorted 
               to Santa's chair by a smiling tiny man (MARCUS) dressed as 
               an elf.

               A large Teddy bear sits under a Christmas tree.

               Suddenly -— it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the 
               room.

               The alarm continues to count down -- 15... 14...

               The Teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of 
               the escalators. Landing on its feet, it barrels toward the 
               door.

<b>               10... 9...

               The Teddy bear scrambles for the door, crashing into

<b>               7... 6... 
</b>
               Running past a clothing display, it rips the arm off a 
               mannequin without breaking stride.

<b>               5... 4... 
</b>
               It skids to a stop at the base of the alarm box, too short 
               to reach the controls.

<b>               2... 
</b>
               It raises the mannequin arm, using the pointed finger on its 
               hand to press the "CANCEL" key on the keypad.

               Mission accomplished, the teddy bear rips off its head to 
               reveal his true identity: Santa's Elf -- in civilian life 
               known as MARCUS SKIDMORE. He is covered in sweat and panting

               Marcus reaches into jewelry cases and removes a few particular 
               items. He drops them into a stock cart then checks a typed 
               list before moving on.

               Marcus pushes the cart through the store, gathering an odd 
               array of items that range from furs to gowns to shoes to 
               makeup.

               Marcus arrives outside a doorway and looks in to see Willie 
               manning a large water drill and putting it to work on the 
               store's vault.

                         I need a melon-bailer and a loofah.

               The drill suddenly revs higher, getting Willie's attention.

               Marcus moves closer as Willie pulls back the drill on the 
               track. He places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly 
               and hits it with a sledgehammer.

               Suddenly, the door swings open and bundled cash spills to 
               the floor. Both men are impressed.

               Marcus and Willie wheel out two carts and roll them through

               Willie settles on the rear bench as Marcus gets into the 
               passenger seat next to his Pillipina Mail-order wife of 
               several years, LOIS, who is dressed in expensively ugly

               The van speeds away through the Christmas Eve night and 
               disappears into the distance, like the down of a thistle.

               Willie, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm. He 
               tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with 
               sleep.

               In a series of frustrated grunts and groans he becomes more 
               and more aggravated until, finally --

               He bolts out of bed and throws the clock into the wall.

               He stoops for some beer bottle empties and hurls them at the 
               clock debris.

               One final scream and it's out of his system. He finds one 
               last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt 
               floating in it.

               He downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to 
               brush his teeth.

               Willie, sipping a cup of coffee, meanders down the street 
               scratching his ass.

<b>               EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
               Willie's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime. As 
               he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from 
               the parking valet key-box and moves on.

               As he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various 
               key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp.

               He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps.

               Willie gets in and drives off.

<b>               INT. CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY

               Willie drives. He reaches over into the glove compartment 
               and pulls out the registration. He focuses on the car owner's 
               address.

               Willie, eating a corn dog, saunters down an opulent hallway, 
               a beer swinging in one hand.

</b>
               In long shot, through the open door of an extravagant marble 
               bathroom, we see Willie sitting on the toilet, leafing through 
               a magazine, beer bottle on the counter next to him. Pants 
               around his ankles.

<b>               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

               Willie, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt 
               and flips the flush lever.

               Nothing happens; no whoosh of rushing water.

               Willie, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple 
               more clanking tries, and then grabs his beer and ambles off.

               Sucking on his beer, Willie paces the periphery of the room,

               Willie arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings 
               until, finally, he exposes a wall safe.

               A smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope.

               Willie scratches a lottery ticket. He's now wearing a Rolex 
               and some gaudy ring.

               He reaches for another one and we see that on the bartop in 
               front of him are neat stacks of lottery tickets as yet 
               unscratched, and an untidy jumble of scratched ones.

               On the other side of the bar a MIDDLE-AGED STRIPPER vies for 
               his attention. Willie's ticket hits for $5.00.

               He tucks it into the Stripper's G-string, swigs a drink, and 
               resumes scratching.

               off a pint of Smirnoff's and flips it towards a nearby trash 
               can. It misses and breaks loudly on the pavement.

               Marcus shoves Willie, who stalks off. Marcus lingers to smooth 
               things over. He forces a grin and shakes his head.

               Another beat. Marcus pantomimes helpless laughter, noiselessly 
               throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with 
               mirth.

               He is instantly composed.

               On an upper floor of Chamberlain's the theme is "The Desert 
               as Winter Wonderland." Cacti and tumbleweeds are wrapped 
               with lights and flocked with snow, and a team of nine stuffed 
               burros are hitched to a sleigh. Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro 
               is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins. One in cowboy 
               wear and another in a poncho and sombrero.

               Again there is a line of waiting children. Marcus makes his 
               way through the line as kids gasp and cheer. He plays to the 
               crowd.

               Yayyyyyy! Marcus gets to the head of the line, ducks under 
               the velvet rope and goes behind the flimsy cardboard set.

               Willie sits there morosely, head slumped, forearms on knees, 
               red velvet hanging limply from one hand.

               it. Marcus stares at him.

               He grabs the hat, slams it into Willie's chest and, as Willie 
               rises, kicks him in the ass. Willie just takes it, shambling 
               off.

               On the outskirts of the Saguaro Square Mall's parking lot a 
               city bus stops with a hiss. The doors swing open to reveal a 
               pathetic EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, overweight, snot-nosed, badly 
               dressed and probably smelling of pee.

               As the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older 
               children doing skateboard stunts. They notice him.

               One of them throws an empty can that hits him in the head.

               The kid walks on, it seems without noticing.

               The bullies, disheartened by the lack of reaction, go back 
               to their skateboarding.

               A large faux rustic bar filled to capacity with loosened-tie 
               middle-management.

               Crammed at the far end of the bar, Willie stands out like a 
               sore thumb in this thirty-ish crowd.

               We follow his gaze all around the perimeter of the room until 
               it connects with the drunken, glowering face of a HINDUSTANI 
               TROUBLEMAKER, sitting right across from him, startling Willie 
               for a moment.

               Willie regains his composure, then gives the guy a puzzled 
               look back, and amused by the guy's unflinching anger, raises 
               his glass in a toast to him as if to say, "whatever... cheers, 
               you nutcase", and turns back to his drink.

               The man stands up and, never releasing his stare, moves right 
               up to Willie, two inches from his face. Willie looks up.

               A hand grabs his arm.

               Willie follows the hand to find a mature but attractive 
               BARMAID (SUE), an outdoorsy western beauty. Her eyes and 
               Willie's lock -- a source of sardonic amusement for the 
               troublemaker.

               She pours two. They both pound them back.

               Her statement is a question:

               Willie is on top of the barmaid, humping her, still in his 
               Santa suit. His pom-pom bobs in rhythm with his thrusts.

               In the parking lot the barmaid finishes straightening her 
               clothes and touching up her lipstick in the rearview mirror.

               Willie, leaning against his car, still in his Santa suit, 
               fires up a post-coital cigarette.

               Willie enters the foyer as the Kid walks into the adjoining

               Grandma rises from her chair with the assistance of her walker 
               and begins to move toward Willie. She wears a bathrobe and 
               thick glasses and has another pair of glasses on a chain

               his stethoscope in his ears.

               In the foreground a few stacks of cash and a folio. Willie 
               reaches in.

               Willie grabs the folio and flips through it. Insurance forms, 
               deeds, Social Security cards, birth certificates, etc., all 
               bear the name of the Kid's father, Roger Merman.

               Nothing of value.

               He puts the folio back, grabs the cash.

               pause. Curious, he heads in the direction of the sounds.

               They're coming from the dressing room area.

               Chipeska curiously makes his way towards a corridor of

               The sound of throttling lust builds in volume. He follows 
               his ears until he arrives at a dressing room door. A Big or 
               Tall woman within screams with pleasure:

               POV through the arcade's window shows Willie talking in 
               pantomime to a young girl -- a very young girl -- at one of 
               the pinball machines. Willie has his hands out to either 
               side and is either demonstrating the kind of body English to 
               apply to the machine, or else is describing an elaborate 
               sexual encounter -- either recalled or prospective. The girl, 
               giggles.

               A REVERSE shows Marcus halted at the arcade window staring 
               in with disbelief that gives way to jaw-grinding anger:

               Willie parks the Mercedes in the front of a rundown motel 
               complex. He walks past hookers and junkies until he gets to 
               his unit.

               He pulls out his key and just as he's about to insert it in 
               the lock he sees a flashlight beam shining inside the window.

               Surprised, he backs off cautiously and presses up against 
               the wall.

               Someone inside is rifling the room.

               Willie hisses at a nearby hooker:

               The silence is deafening. Endless.

               Later. The kid lies in bed, sleeping peacefully.

               Distant sounds of the slosh of water.

               The sloshing of water is now accompanied by a rhythmic 
               slapping sound.

               Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi. He is wearing his Santa

               A splash of orange juice is dolloped into each of the glasses, 
               and then both are filled to the top with vodka.

               WIDER on the living room reveals Sue looking around. Her 
               speech -- and Willie's -- is somewhat impaired:

               Sue accepts her refilled glass and sits on the sofa.

               She reaches down to fish under her ass in the sofa cushion, 
               and pulls out a red checker. She dully inspects it.

               He closes the door. He then tips back the bottle and polishes 
               it off with a series of quick gulps.

               Ever so daintily, he puts the bottle down. A beat later --

               WHAM! He faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled 
               tree.

               He looks blearily up and immediately grabs his head, feeling 
               his hangover.

               Following his ears he heads toward the hall. He passes 
               Grandma.

               A bedroom door crashes open and the Kid emerges screaming 
               and runs right into Willie. He immediately caroms off and 
               goes screaming down the hall.

               He looks down at his T-shirt. There is a bloody palm-print 
               on his stomach.

               He turns the corner to the hall, There is a row of fresh, 
               bloody palm-prints down one side of the hall. The Kid, 
               screaming, is just disappearing at the far end.

               As Willie drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut, 
               the Kid takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to 
               say:

               Willie grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and 
               liberally pours some on the hand. The Kid shrieks.

                         store detective Sherlock, that's 
                         what I do. Seven cities in seven 
                         years. Pretty impressive. The stores 
                         change, your names change. You always 
                         get away clean. Yeah, pretty darn 
                         impressive. But let's face facts -- 
                         you all are a couple of half-bucket 
                         small-timers. Because of your physical 
                         attributes you've found a niche. I 
                         respect that. But you've also been 
                         caught. By me. So this is the way 
                         how we gonna do things. I don't want 
                         to take over, I don't even want to 
                         change your scam. Whatever you guys

               After a long beat, we hear a door opening.

               The kid stands in the doorway from the house. He looks at 
               Willie, motionless in the car.

               along the sidewalk, looking off, struck by what he sees.

               He slows and then comes to a stop having pulled even with a 
               group of other children gathered on the sidewalk also looking 
               off at the same spot. They stare for a good long beat, 
               expressions rather neutral. But the sight, whatever it is, 
               holds their attention.

               Finally one in the foreground remarks:

<b>                                     KID
</b>                         I didn't know he did that.

               Their POV: rather distant, on a grassy hill a man in a Santa 
               suit is pounding the shit out of the bullies. One of the 
               bullies throws a punch, but Santa grabs his fist and pushes 
               him down. Santa puts his foot on another bully's butt and 
               sends him flying. After more wrestling and flinging about, 
               the bullies wind up in a heap on the ground.

               Willie, a faraway look in his eye, sits on a bench near 
               Marcus, who is finishing putting on his elf outfit.

               Willie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait:

                         for a purpose. It really made me

               Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through 
               a rack of furs.

               A salesman approaches from behind her. She somehow senses 
               his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs:

               Willie and Sue come in, carrying a few bottles of liquor.

               Willie closes the door, and freezes, realizing that something 
               is wrong.

               He hears the TV and heads for the living room. Sue follows a 
               few steps behind.

               Willie finds Grandma in her chair, not moving.

               The Kid sleeps. He is awakened by the sounds of stumbling 
               and CLANKING BOTTLES. He hears GIGGLING, more STUMBLING. He 
               gets up.

               The Kid discovers some clothes. Then some more. He follows

               Facing the CAMERA, Willie's in his underpants and Santa hat 
               lying on the floor on top of Sue. He's gripping her panties 
               with his teeth -- stretching the elastic while he starts 
               pulling them down. Sue's giggling.

               The bedroom door opens behind them and the Kid walks in. He 
               comes up and stands over them, a few steps behind Willie.

               Willie freezes, panty elastic waistband still stretched out 
               in his teeth. He senses something, and his eyes look up from 
               under his Santa hat, his wolfish smile fades.

               The Kid stands there, hands behind his back.

                         and give presents to the world and 
                         after that you won't be around no

               The Kid takes his hands from behind his back and extends a 
               small present in crudely taped-up wrapping paper.

               This forces Willie to let go of the panties. They SNAP back.

               He sits up. He takes the gift and opens it. Inside is a 
               roughly whittled crescent of brown wood.

               She goes back to grabbing him passionately.

               Marcus looks up to see Willie, totally shit-faced. His costume 
               is half on, his undergarments are showing, and his hand 
               clutches the neck of a broken bottle.

               Willie stumbles over a burro and falls into a pile of fake 
               snow. He rises to his feet and begins to pummel the statue.

               Willie finishes dispatching the burro and stumbles to his 
               Santa chair. Marcus stomps up to him.

               Marcus stands by the side of his van. It's parked on the 
               shoulder with the hood up, jumper cables attached and hanging. 
               Lois is in the driver's seat.

               Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags 
               him down.

               SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls 
               over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, 
               and strides over to the van.

               He shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to 
               the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises 
               the hood.

               The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet 
               apart as Gin opens the hood.

               Gin grabs the cables from him. Marcus takes a few steps back.

               Lois turns the key and the van starts right up. Gin takes 
               the cables off the van and closes the hood. He lights up a 
               Pall Mall.

               Marcus signals to Lois. She puts the car into gear and stomps 
               her foot on the accelerator, squashing Gin between the two 
               vehicles.

               Lois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him.

               ANGLE ON: the tires spinning in the gravel.

               Finally, she takes her foot off the gas. The van eases back.

               Gin falls to the ground with a groan. Marcus steps up and 
               leans over him.

               Then, leaning down to Gin.

               He grabs the jumper cables still connected to Gin's 4 X 4 
               and clamps the other ends on Gin's ears. A small jolt and a 
               spark or two. Only a minor shock.

               He grabs Gin's arm and with great effort drags him over a 
               few feet so that his head is positioned behind the front 
               tire of the van. Gin tries to crawl out of the way.

               With the sound of closing circuits, banks of light

               Jesse heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches 
               the key labeled ARM. An LED readout labeled ARMING counts

               snaps on a biking helmet and takes a deep breath.

               We PAN and WHIP-PIVOT along the outside of several lengths 
               of ductwork, following the muffled SCREAM of a thousand 
               girlies echoing inside.

               The ductwork dimples out along the bottom with the WUBBA 
               sound of flopping aluminum as Marcus's weight travels its 
               length; at turns, Marcus's inertial force makes one side of 
               the duct momentarily dent out.

               We thus follow Marcus's progress as he slides, bumps, 
               ricochets and barrels through the department store.

               scream grows louder until --

               bursts open and --

               -- Marcus drops from the duct.

               THUD! He lands on the table of sweaters placed by Lois.

               In a split-second, he sits up and looks at the alarm box.

<b>               7... 6...

               He hops off the table and pushes it toward the alarm box.

               The far side of the table smashes into the wall beneath the 
               alarm box.

               Marcus kicks out the collapsible legs on the near side, making 
               that edge of the table crash to the ground, creating a ramp.

               He sprints away from the table spins, and runs back towards 
               it...

               Willie stares at the safe while rubbing sandpaper to his 
               fingertips.

               Meanwhile, Marcus emerges from a stockroom with a cart to 
               begin his shopping spree.

               Willie applies a stethoscope to the safe, tapping with one 
               hand and listening intently.

               Marcus starts in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere 
               scarf.

               Willie applies the drill to the safe.

               Marcus makes his way through Lingerie.

               Willie pulls back the drill. The bit is trashed, the safe is 
               completely unscathed.

               Marcus is in Shoes picking out pumps for Lois.

               Willie is in Home Improvement, flipping tools off the shelves 
               into a cart of his own.

               Marcus is in Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole 
               off a mannequin.

               Willie batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door.

               Marcus continues to leap at the mannequin.

               Willie is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock.

               Marcus swings at the mannequin's knees with a golf club.

               Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe.

               Marcus, having chopped down the mannequin, drags off its 
               stole.

               Willie is back over the safe, battering it with the 
               sledgehammer, roaring with each swing.

               Marcus is in Housewares pilfering crock pots.

               Willie, sweating, drops the sledgehammer clanking to the 
               floor. Wiping his forehead, he circles the safe. When he 
               gets to the back of the safe he stops, thinks.

               Marcus is in Home Entertainment grabbing a stereo.

               Willie is hunched at the back of the safe, stethoscope to 
               its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles.

               Sound perspective through the stethoscope: hollow THUNKS 
               followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK.

               Willie reacts quizzically. After a considering moment he 
               rises. we can see, on the far side of the safe, its door as 
               it finishes creaking open.

               Marcus enters the room. Willie looks at him.

</b>                         Piece of cake.

               Marcus starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into 
               the Santa sack. Willie wipes sweat off his forehead.

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         ...I'll be right back. I gotta grab

               We are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed 
               elephant.

               Willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one 
               behind, which is purple. We hear him muttering:

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         Shit... which did he say?

               The hand finally leaves with the purple elephant.

               We hold for a long beat.

               The hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink.

               Willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant.

               Marcus and Lois are standing there presenting a grotesque 
               picture: Lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, 
               jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, an 
               abdomen exerciser. She wears a pair of sunglasses from which 
               a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole.

               Next to her Marcus holds the Santa bag bulging with -- indeed, 
               sprouting -- cash.

               Something in this picture makes Willie uneasy. He licks his 
               lips.

</b>                         ...greedier than fuck.

               waistband.

               CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK -- the sound of many guns

               Willie stares. Marcus looks wildly around.

               Willie slaps his forehead.

<b>               BANG! BANG! BANG!

               His .45 roars.

               The cops return fire.

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         Fuck me...

               He ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries 
               behind a counter.

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         ...fuck me fuck me fuck me...

               Gunfire fills the air.

               Exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind Willie 
               as the cops seek to put him down.

               Under the gunfire we hear Marcus's maniacal laughter.

               Willie reaches the end of the counter. A brief open space 
               separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire 
               redoubles and plunges down the stairs.

<b>               EXT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - LOADING DOCK - NIGHT
</b>
               Willie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the 
               elephant. He dives into his Mercedes and peels out.

<b>               EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
               Rounding the corner of the loading dock, Willie comes upon a 
               fleet of squad cars idling in the street. Cops yell, draw 
               their guns and fire as Willie clips a couple cars, skids and 
               slues, and finally is clear of the pack.

               He roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles, 
               crank up their sirens and pursue.

<b>               INT. MERCEDES - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
               Willie drives, his jaw set, a desperate man in a Santa suit.

               He glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light 
               bars.

                         kid is getting his present.

<b>               EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
</b>
               Willie's car corners onto Sage Terrace on two wheels, slams 
               back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and 
               squeals braking into its driveway.

               The police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew 
               around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn. Cops leap out of 
               their cars just as Willie jumps from his.

</b>                         Halt, put your hands up!

               Willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door. His 
               voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone:

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         Up your ass!

               He bounds up the stoop.

<b>                                     POLICE VOICE
</b>                         All right, boys -- nail him!

               A ripple of gunfire.

               At the top of the stoop, facing the door, Willie staggers, 
               rolls his eyes, and -- drops.

<b>               NEARBY WINDOW
</b>
               Drawn by the noise, an adorable six-year-old in a nearby 
               house slides open his second-story bedroom window to look.

<b>               HIS HIGH POV:
</b>
               Frozen in a semi-circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn, 
               an army of cops has guns trained on the felled Santa Claus, 
               who is sprawled on the neighbor's stoop, motionless. His 
               hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink 
               elephant un-delivered...

               The six year old draws in his breath and SCREAMS.

               He is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister 
               who look, and SCREAM, with him.

               Somewhere, a neighborhood dog barks.

               A Cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children.

</b>
<b>               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               After a long beat, Willie's voice:

<b>                                     WILLIE (V.O.)
</b>                         Dear kid. I hope that you got my 
                         present and that there wasn't too 
                         much blood on it, although there was 
                         blood on the present you gave me 
                         which didn't keep me from enjoying 
                         it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter 
                         so much I guess.

               We are FADING IN on a shelf in the Kid's bedroom where the 
               stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed 
               stiff and stained with dried blood. The Kid's bedroom is no 
               longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy. We PAN OFF of 
               it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a 
               little bulletin board.

<b>                                     WILLIE (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Anyway, just in case they took it 
                         as evidence I am also sending you a 
                         T-shirt. I hope it's the right size. 
                         I am healing up good and they tell 
                         me that I will soon be one hundred 
                         percent even with eight bullets dug 
                         out of me because they didn't hit 
                         any vital organs, just my liver which 
                         is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways...

               Our CONTINUING PAN brings us to the open door of the bedroom 
               and we hear the sound of the TV in the living room. We TRACK 
               toward it.

<b>                                     WILLIE (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Thank you for giving that letter 
                         to the cops. I forgot I asked you to 
                         do it but it's a good thing you did 
                         or Santa's little helper would've 
                         plugged his ass. And now the cops 
                         know I wrote it, which is gonna keep 
                         my ass out of jail. That, plus 
                         everyone agreeing that the Phoenix 
                         police department shooting an unarmed 
                         Santa was even more fucked-up than 
                         Rodney King. The cops are treating 
                         me like fucking royalty now which is 
                         new in my experience. They are gonna 
                         make me a sensitivity counselor so 
                         that tragedies like this will never 
                         again embarrass the whole fucking 
                         department. Whatever.

               Grandma is in the living room watching TV. We TRACK past her 
               towards the Jacuzzi area.

</b>                         ...As for my little helper, I am 
                         sorry to have to tell you that him 
                         and his prune-faced mail-order-wife 
                         are gonna be exploring mountains 
                         with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't 
                         go sucking shit from them like I 
                         did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you 
                         had no one to take the fuck care of 
                         you, so they set it up with Mrs. 
                         Santa's sister watching you till 
                         your Dad gets back in one year and 
                         three months. They made her a Guardian 
                         Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway, 
                         she makes better money than bartending 
                         and seems to like you and your house 
                         and Jacuzzi.

               Sue is in a towel, holding a highball as she climbs out of 
               the Jacuzzi. The Kid walks by her carrying a bucket. She 
               tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by. He's never 
               looked better.

               WE TRACK TOWARDS THE FOYER. It's empty but the front door is 
               open. We TRACK towards it.

               We go out the front door...

                         now, telling the police how screwed-
                         up they are which is not a bad job 
                         as jobs go. They're supposed to let 
                         me out of this hospital room soon so 
                         I'll see you when I come over to 
                         fuck Mrs. Santa's sister in the 
                         Jacuzzi. Until then, don't take no 
                         shit from nobody. Least of all 
                         yourself. Anyways... see ya soon...

               The Kid is dipping a toilet-bowl brush into a bucket of soapy 
               water on the front stoop.

               As the Kid turns and hunkers down to scrub the dried blood 
               off the stoop, we see the back of his T-shirt. SHIT HAPPENS
