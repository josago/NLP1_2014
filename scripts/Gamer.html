    Some years from this exact moment...

<b>1   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  1
</b>
<b>    DARKNESS - NOW
</b>
    The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the
    COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face.

    They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS
    FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding
    into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's
    dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track
    and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and
    hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel-
    eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL.

    ZERO IN on TWO:
    KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes
    burning with internalized emotion...

    ... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell -
    both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported
    through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around.

    Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their
    swagger seems to mask FEAR.

    KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell.   The GIRL
    makes eye contact w/ him.

<b>                                   SANDRA
</b>                  Sandra.

    KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic.

                            SANDRA (cont'd)
                  My name is Sandra.

<b>                            GUARD
</b>                  Shut the fuck up.

    Because he can, the GUARD takes a swing at KABLE'S head with
    a BILLY CLUB... CRACK!

    KABLE'S skull snaps back into the window. The GUARD swings
    again, this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach.

<b>                           SANDRA
</b>                     (to the GUARD, a snarl)
                 Putcher dick away...

<b>                             GUARD
</b>                 Get some.

    CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!!     SANDRA is buckled
    over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat,
    head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints,
    every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART...
    He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights
    through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle
    herself.

    The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a
    glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing
    it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the
    others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN -
    growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting
    out all thought... until...

<b>2   INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY                                                    2
</b>
    POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL
    towards dirty white DAYLIGHT...

    NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound
    of his boots bouncing off the concrete...

    Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the
    tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke,
    sky...

    Our POV WHITES OUT as we...

    Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over
    burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers
    disappear into the grey mist.

    ... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out
    of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an
    OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella
<b>    2005).
</b>
    In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE -
    accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce
    somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin,
    then snap into place. GO TIME.

    Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and
    INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out.

</b>
    What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a
    closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like
    hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits
    apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they
    hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head.

</b>
    KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES
    COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade
    away... until...

<b>    NOTHING.   DEAD QUIET.
</b>
    SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN
    we hear a GUNSHOT.

    Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder -
    after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the
    lightning, wait for the thunder.

    In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from
    behind an old car to a brick staircase.   Then another BLUE
    runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS.
    BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...

<b>    BOOM.
</b>
    ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN...
    KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly
    shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE
    into the mist:

    THOOM! THOOM!   The shells puncture air and connect
    distantly...

    The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he
    breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS
    READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic
    fire.

<b>8   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET                                8
</b>
    A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally
    IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut
    and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM
    holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.

    From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN & BLUE
    combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS.   In the top right corner
    of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat
    transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to
    your own reflection on a TV).

    We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE.
    KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the
    third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND
    SPEAKERS, behind us:

    A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be
    outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly
    belong to KABLE.

<b>                           VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                     (clean, disconnected)
                 Eat shit please.

    THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts
    back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front.
    Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store.

    A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a
    bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem
    almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his
    left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting
    the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT
    TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some
    clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the
    ground, dead.

    Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on
    him. Uh oh...

    BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the
    knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing
    straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles
    over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees.
    The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and
    bone TRIPOD.

<b>     VROOOOOOSH!!! CHUKUNK, CHUKUNK!! A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH
</b>     THE DESTRUCTION, pushing the bodies and debris out of the way
     and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt
     flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds.

     Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting
     obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing
     truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN
     WOMAN gets right back up... walking into and getting
     obliterated by another TRUCK.   It's creepy - robotic, but
     violent and too real - like a programmed suicide.

<b>                            VOICE (O.S.)

     We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to
     the peripheral.

     Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking
     aim; we SNAP ZOOM in...

<b>     SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE:
</b>
     The transparent GHOST OF A FACE, as though projected on
     glass. The LIPS MOVE in sync with:

<b>                            VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                  Shit! Shit!

     KABLE spins, TOO LATE -

     BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an
     open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP
     THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.

     The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT
     collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA.

     KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way. They
     bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops
     to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant -

     HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O.          Blood and particles splatter
     over KABLE's gear.

     Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES.

     Up ahead HE SEES IT: an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small
     GLOWING EMERALD GREEN WINDOWS. He makes for it.

     The little FLY following him is picked out of the air by a
     stray shot - PLINK!

                            VOICE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  ... what the...!

     Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's
<b>     QUICK...
</b>
     A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his
     feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE
<b>     BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH.
</b>
     He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN.

     KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room. The
     second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all
     around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from
     loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYCLING
<b>     DOWN.
</b>
     The battle is over - session complete.

     KABLE steps out.    The LEDS on his weapon blink off in
     sequence...

     ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's.

     [I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row
     inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage.

     GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that

     are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... petty
     thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by
     participating to commute their sentences]

     A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His
     eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from
     him.

</b>
     A spartan, underground LAB.

     A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE;
     on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH. In front of
     him, floating in the air, is one of the little metallic
<b>     FLIES.
</b>
     He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes
     right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he
     could ever touch it.

     Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the
     remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK.

     CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one
     side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air.
     There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end.

     The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the
     lens up to his eyes. Switch to:

     POV of the FLY CAM: the TECH'S face, extreme wide angle,
     examining. The image flickers, glitches - then CUTS TO:

<b>                               KEN CASTLE
</b>                  Simple.

     A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the
     VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIER'S head - and
     then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  It begins with a single nano-cell
                  planted in the motor cortex of the
                  brain -- this cell can replicate,
                  replacing the cells `round it with
                  perfect copies...

     We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a
     bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal cell
     next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it has
     turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues,
     multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that
     the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  ... these copied cells contain
                  remote access functionality.
                  Therefore, nano plus cortex equals
                  the nanex.

     The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands
     working a retro ATARI-style joystick... animated waves

                  you promised us a demonstration.

     CASTLE smiles broadly.

                  Did I? You know I seem to recall
                  that - let's just see...

     CASTLE waves in his PERSONAL SECURITY:

     A half dozen GEEKS in BLACK JEANS, BLACK T-SHIRTS w/ WHITE
     SOCKS and SNEAKERS; BACKPACKS... yes, even FANNY PACKS. A
     full range of GEEK VARIATIONS: beard/mustache combos, thick
     glasses, pony tails, etc.

     One GEEK brings out the CUTEST, SOFTEST little SPANIEL PUPPY
     in the world and places it in CASTLE'S LAP.

     Meanwhile several OTHERS are directing HANDHELD SENSORS at
     GINA and thumb-clicking to establish TRACKING POINTS - her
     slightest movements are scanned and interpreted as data in
     real time.

     Somehow, in his sweet southern drawl this rolls off almost
     acceptable. The CREW has a laugh off-screen; GINA blushes.

     wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other
     prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a
     half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered in
     the same white powder - they look like tribesmen.

     One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly        *

     Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the
     distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta
     smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind.

     The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last
     time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops
     moving.

     The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain.

     A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners.
     They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind
     to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive.

     In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses
     between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by
     an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body
     goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.

     KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA cut
     out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a white
     cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the yard
     a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE

     In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, walks

     A prisoner sings Metallica off key, but balls to the walls:

<b>                            PRISONER
</b>                  Master!
                  Master!
                  Master of Puppets I'm pulling your
                  strings - Twisting your mind and
                  smashing your dreams...

     KABLE is alone in his cell.

     At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT to
     push food through - it opens. But instead of a tray, someone
     pushes through a wrinkled photograph.

     KABLE picks it up and looks - a WOMAN, just a blur of golden
     hair, laughing, and a LITTLE GIRL... the same one in KABLE'S
     vision.

<b>                            WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>                  You want to get back to them.

     KABLE is stunned, silent. He sits on the ground, shoulder
     leaning against the heavy door, staring at the girl in the
     picture.

                            WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  It's all you think about. It's the
                  only thing that keeps you alive.

     Her words are like hammer blows to his guts; he wants to weep
     but he's too strong, too internalized. He steels himself.

<b>                            KABLE
</b>                  Who's talking?

     She pushes through a white NOTECARD and PEN.

<b>                               WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>                  Sign it.

     KABLE doesn't take it.

                  David is your biggest fan. He
                  prays for you.

     This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen
     and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back
     through the slider.

     PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she
     draws out a little blood.

     KABLE yanks his hand back out.

                            WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  Need to prove it's authentic.

                  Damn...

     At the far end of the solitary block a BUZZER sounds - then
     the SLIDE and SLAM of heavy steel.

                              WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  Gotta go.

     KABLE jumps up and pulls himself against the door - a
     lifeline is slipping away...

<b>                             KABLE
</b>                  Wait.
                      (he holds the wrinkled
                        photo to the window)
                  How did you get this picture?            Have
                  you seen them?

     He peers through the little window at the top of the door,
     but she's GONE...

     Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor
     to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces from
     the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was
     being beaten down.

     SOUNDS creeping up behind. Whoever's controlling him doesn't
     seem to have noticed - he's too focused on the enemies in the
     sights.

     We can see the tension in KABLE'S FACE - he's helpless,

<b>52   INT. SIMON'S HOUSE - HALLWAY                                     52
</b>
     SIMON - 18, pale and lanky, unkempt shaggy hair; wearing a
     vintage Guns `n' Roses T-shirt from the Appetite For
     Destruction Tour - walks down a long, high ceilinged crystal
     hall with marble floors, macking on the sandwich... passes
     through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a
     massive, exotic aquarium - he's alone in what appears to be a
     vast, cold mansion.

<b>53   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   53
</b>
     SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each one a
     3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the
     screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON
     himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TECH
<b>     SPACE.
</b>
     The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STUNT
     JUMP and ROLLS onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows,
     sandwich intact.

     The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing for
     prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK
     TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, etc.
     Everything dynamic, everything moving.

     One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the
     SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND, with updated statistics... POINTS
     LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these
     categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his name
     illustrates the point.

     In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention:

<b>                    KABLE EARNS 800 UPGRADE POINTS
</b>
     A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series
     of revolving images - WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, BODY ARMOR.

     SIMON interacts with the 3-D environment using HAND GESTURES -
     he can SLIDE, SQUEEZE, PULL AND SCROLL the images just by
     moving his fingers in the air.

     He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS...

                  hm.

     He stops on an animated graphic. A SEXY FEMALE VOICE breaks
     it all down for us:

<b>                            FEMALE VOICE
</b>                  Swarmers. The latest innovation
                  from Browning, this self detonating
                  cartridge offers the widest and
                  deadliest spray available from a
                  full tracking, cornering ordnance.

     A VIDEO DEMO shows the fired cartridge SPLIT into two-dozen
     smaller shells that FLASH OUT like a swarm of bees, wind
     around a corner and utterly SHRED a TEST DUMMY.

<b>                            SIMON
</b>                  Daddy like...

     An ANNOYING GIRL'S VOICE pops in, along with a VID CHAT
     SCREEN that takes over the MAIN WALL. She looks about 16 -
     skinny, skanky, kind of hot.

<b>                              ANNOYING GIRL

<b>                            ANNOYING GIRL
</b>                  You suck, Simon - you're going to
                  get my boyfriend killed before he
                  can get out of jail and fill me up
                  with his hot seed.

<b>                              SIMON
</b>                  Uh huh.

     Another GIRL - 17, cute, stoned - chimes in.

<b>                            CUTE STONED GIRL
</b>                  Simon, I just wanna play you.

<b>                            ANNOYING GIRL
</b>                  Shut up bitch.

     SIMON casually waves his hand at the frame, like flicking at
     a fly; ANNOYING GIRL is wiped away, bringing CUTE STONED GIRL
     to the forefront.

     SIMON notices a metallic sparkle from the GIRL'S TONGUE.

<b>                         SIMON
</b>               What is that?
                   (like a dentist)
               Aaaa.

     He reaches out and "pinches" the screen, ZOOMING IN close as
     she sticks out her tongue - it fills the wall... a dozen
     wicked looking BLACK TONGUE RINGS stud the wet pink flesh,
<b>     TEN FEET HIGH.
</b>
                            SIMON (cont'd)
               Woah.

     He quickly unsqueezes, zooming back out. The GIRL'S eyes are
     rolled back in her head, euphoric; she's WASTED.

<b>                         CUTE STONED GIRL
</b>               You like me?

     A THIRD GIRL pops in, filling the opposite wall.

<b>                         SHELLY
</b>               What's up, loser?

<b>                            SIMON
</b>               Hey sissy.

     This is SIMON'S SISTER, SHELLY, 14.       Frosted up lips, eyes
     and hair like a Tokyo hooker.

<b>                         SHELLY

               you're pathetic, and you smell like
               Jeffrey Dahmer.

     With a wave of his hand he wipes her image off the screen.

     TWO MORE video chats pop up - TWIN 21-YEAR OLD GIRLS,
     stupidly hot.

     SIMON snaps his fingers; all the windows close
     simultaneously.

     SIMON makes a clicking sound with his tongue in the new
     silence. Peace at last.

     BY THEMSELVES, the screens come BACK TO LIFE.

                            SIMON (cont'd)
               D'oh.

     The instant chat boxes are gone, replaced by a soundless,
     GRAINY VIDEO LOOP - there is something sinister about the lo-
     fi image... it looks like the feed from an old SURVEILLANCE
<b>     CAM:
</b>
     Two men are sitting in a room... it's silent, but one of them
     seems to be SCREAMING - he lifts a gun...

                         SIMON (cont'd)
               What the fuh...?

     ... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD.
     Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats.

     When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON
     freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN.

     It's KABLE.

     A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time -
     we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ video
     prank earlier:

     You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
     So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel...

     PAVEMENT flies by... sun SLAMS rainbow flares into the
     lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us...

     We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE,
     skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly
     follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops,
     belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs...
     ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs...

     They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced
     with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face
     plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING
<b>     PARTY!!!
</b>
     We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated,
     but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is
     heightened, off-kilter.

     On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a
     WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big
     plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS...

     A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS,
     totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS,
     out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The
     SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare
     legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but
     STILL GRINNING ecstatically...

     A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium
     balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of
     interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED...

     People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on
     the ground... and in the middle of it all...

     He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They
     start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS
     UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the
     other.

     He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the
     base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her;
     SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders...

     ANGIE just looks straight ahead... her EYES move to a nearby
     building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has
     switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured
     prominently.

     She watches KABLE'S face move... she lets out an involuntary
     MOAN that is more like a whimper...

     He rips into his BRAIN STEM with a tiny piece of busted
     RAZOR, hoping to pull out a chip, a wire, anything. He pulls
     out something, and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor
     - FRIED POTATOES. He lands on a couple of dumbbells, his
     head smashing into the weight bench, spinal cord SEVERED.

     KABLE looks on, impassive, emotion internalized.       GUARDS push
     through.

     Now HACKMAN is looking at KABLE dead blank. A GUARD comes up
     behind HACKMAN and SHOVES HIM. HACKMAN turns; the GUARD

               Let's go. Upgrades.

     KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a
     massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically
     projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other
     PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot.

     KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his
     weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET...

     We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of
     target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and
     several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This
     thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out

     KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other
     PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACKMAN.

<b>                         KABLE

     KABLE glances at the GUARD... he struggles - part of him
     feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being
     grateful for the human interaction.

     HACKMAN rubs his SLIPPERY HANDS together, relishing it; he

     KABLE tenses up, ready for INSTANT VIOLENCE.

                          HACKMAN (cont'd)
                You got two whores, Kable...

     If he didn't have KABLE'S attention before, THIS GOT IT.

<b>                          KABLE
</b>                - the fuck did you say?

<b>                          HACKMAN
</b>                On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I

                to get back to them but I'm going
                to visit them first...

     KABLE is instantly ALL BUSINESS - he's going to make HACKMAN
     disappear RIGHT THE FUCK NOW...

     He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE
     SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING... another...
     another... WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

<b>     NOWHERE.
</b>
     KABLE SLAMS a FIST into a locker, BUSTING it off it's hinges.

     The CAMERA ANGLE on HACKMAN begins to switch perspectives and
     spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in three
     dimensions.

<b>                          CASTLE
</b>                He's so perfect.

     Snap out to reveal CASTLE in a dark lounge; the walls and
     ceiling are pure black, making it impossible to tell the
     dimensions of the room. Minimalist, expensive looking
     furniture is scattered around. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE
<b>     ROOM.
</b>
     CASTLE is standing, bare feet on white shag carpet. He is
     manipulating the image of HACKMAN in the air by pulling,
     squeezing, twisting with his hands - the interface is similar
     to the one in SIMON'S room.

     CASTLE is as pumped as a kid on Christmas morning. Then, from
     behind him:

<b>                          CASTLE 2
</b>                He's scary.

     We see that a perfect double of CASTLE himself has appeared
     in the room behind him.

<b>                              CASTLE
</b>                  Yeah...

     He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better view -
     then turns to face his DOUBLE...

     Another CASTLE appears to CASTLE'S left.

<b>                            CASTLE 3
</b>                  He's right.

     CASTLE faces them.

                  you can reach out and feel the wet
                  flesh - Trust me, they'll change
                  their point of view.

     Suddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera
     around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He
     stares into the void, calm and utterly in control.

     The CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK...

     there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT

     SHHHTUNK. A 50 CALIBER SHELL connects from somewhere distant

     KABLE doesn't even register this. His darting eyes pick up a
     familiar face in the chaos: FREEK.

     FREEK has apparently volunteered as a generi-con - he is
     dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him as he
     walks across the street.

     It all happens too quickly: A BROWN scrambles behind FREEK
     and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squeezes
     off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire -
     the BROWN keeps running... there's nothing KABLE can do.

     He emerges in an UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL. Forty or fifty
     cars and SUVs, 2000-2009, lie dormant, covered in dirt,
     dust, and debris. KABLE switches on a LIGHT built in to his
     weapon.

     The FLY CAM scans 360 degrees, independent of KABLE, giving

     KABLE emerges several blocks from where he started, on a
     narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat.
     Buildings shelter the street on either side... several blocks
     down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL

     then, REAL TIME - we whip around to follow the mortar as it
     whistles into concrete and BLOWS OUT the front of a building.

     He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the
     direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact
     still raining down... and then:

     From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of
     IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN.

     HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S
     hand; it skitters across the concrete.

     SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no
     time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every
     move pings a step late...

     KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is
     moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control.

     HACKMAN slams the    pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING
     HIM - then tosses    the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty,
     high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points
     the barrel at his    FACE.

     He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER...

     The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.       FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP.

     The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down-
     cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and
     plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD.

     ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the

     A drab brownstone apartment.

     Shades block out the oppressive nicotine sunlight; the
     interior is mute, faded - claustrophobic. KABLE has his cell;
     even though ANGIE is on the outside, and free, her

     looking herself over. She's FULLY DRESSED... but not like we
     saw her in society. Conservative. Pretty. NORMAL. She
     rehearses a friendly smile, but has difficulty not breaking
     into tears.

     ANGIE sits uncomfortably in a hard plastic chair; the light

     no-nonsense Social Services CASEWORKER, late 30s, CUBAN.

     warmth she can muster; it's not convincing.

     Overhead fluorescents shock and hum to life, revealing a

     and A LOCKER. KABLE is in his COMBAT BROWN.

     He PRINT ACTIVATES the locker. The WEAPON is there... and
     something else: a wrinkled BROWN PAPER BAG. What the hell?
     He takes it out, trying not to glance too obviously at the
     overhead SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CUT TO the POV from the CAM: KABLE is opening the bag...

     BACK in the room. Inside the brown bag is a FIFTH OF VODKA.
     KABLE quickly slips it into his side cargo-pocket.

                         VOICE (cont'd)
               Kable, what the hell is that?!

     Behind KABLE a DOOR SLIDES OPEN automatically, revealing a

     sprint for the daylight, trying to escape the TORTURE... it's

     FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model,
     which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as
     BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass
     wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH

     KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open... ENGRAVED
     under the cap is a prominent WARNING:

                                  Ethanol Only

<b>                            SIMON (O.S.)
</b>                  Kable. Dude. What are you doing?

     KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat.

     Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on
     the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK.

                            SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  What the hell?

     He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the
     feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down
     the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE
     brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT
     LOOKING. His head is clearing.

     KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE
     TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless.

     KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's
     regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S
     SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A
     BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS THE
<b>     IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK...
</b>
     BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole
     into the dashboard.

     KABLE checks what's left of the mirror.               HACKMAN and six
     other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast.

     VRUUUUUM, VRUUUM... KABLE hammers on the pedal again,
     knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!!

     He SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT.

     HACKMAN leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points
     50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant
     KABLE grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up -

     BOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the
     truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and
     launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars.

     HACKMAN gets in one last shot as KABLE punches it out of the
     garage, disintegrating a concrete column.

<b>                         HACKMAN

     He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving
     it in.

     The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the
     truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING
     GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture -
     now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA
     forward, next to the driver's window...

     The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a
     mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head.

<b>                         SIMON (O.S.)

     KABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the
     window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way,
     barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the
     window of a building. Bye, FLY.

      POPS IT. They're GONE.

<b>117   INT. HUMANZ HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER                             117
</b>
      A DARK, underground VIDEO ARCADE... low ceilings, concrete;
      OLD SCHOOL - sort of a graveyard of lost games... the
      classics of the 80s - MISSILE COMMAND, DEFENDER, ROBOTRON,
      CRANK, etc. The dimensions of the room are impossible to
      determine. A dozen or so PEOPLE - just BLACK SILHOUETTES in
      the CATHODE RAY GLOW - are scattered around, banging buttons,
      giving it body english, racking up scores.

      TRACE leads KABLE through, toward the one BRIGHTLY LIT SPOT:
      at the center of the arcade, an AIR HOCKEY table is blasted
      with WHITE LIGHT from above. HUMANZ BROTHER, who we
      recognize from SIMON'S vid screen, and HUMANZ DUDE - mid 20s,
      long hair - are playing: CLACKCLACK, CLICK, CLACKCLUNK,
<b>      CLACK...
</b>
      They are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appear
      to notice KABLE.

      HUMANZ BROTHER smacks a random 3-bank           WINNER.

<b>                             HUMANZ BROTHER

      HUMANZ DUDE measures a shot, rolling the paddle with one
      finger - then LETS IT RIP - slamming the GAME WINNER in a
      STRAIGHT LINE past HUMANZ BROTHER'S frozen paddle - SCORE: 7-

      SIMON is in a stark interrogation room, alone, drumming his
      fingers on the table - thumb-to-pinky, pinky-to-thumb. Trying

      see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup.

      The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to
      SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he can
      manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being
      interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls.

      ANGIE is on the sidewalk, a little unsteady on high heels -
      wearing the outfit GORGE CHOSE.

      OTHER PEOPLE are wandering around everywhere. A DEBUTANTE-
      type in a pink ensemble has a poofy SHITZU on a leash; the
      SHITZU is PISSING ON IT'S OWNER'S LEG, but she doesn't seem
      to notice. A TAXI speeds by with FOUR PEOPLE crushed in the
      back seat having CRAZY ANIMAL SEX. ANGIE starts walking.

      She passes a FAMILIAR FACE, who turns to watch her go,
      without expression - is that GINA PARKER SMITH?

      ANGIE walks around the corner to a BAR and goes in.

      The THORAX BAR is small, intimate, but ULTRA-STYLED... the
      theme is insect. All manner of exotic bug preserved in
      glass, suspended in ice... one wall is a giant, black-lit ANT
      FARM... green, glowing FIREFLIES dart through the air...
      people lounge on plush seating, gobbling up creatively
      prepared bug delicacies - FRIED PINK GRASSHOPPERS, fat yellow
      GRUBS with red chili oil...

      ANGIE takes a seat at the BAR.

</b>                   The usual?

      She just WINKS, flirtatious.

      The BARTENDER returns a smile and shakes up an AQUA BLUE
      MARTINI... to finish, he plops in a LIVE, WHITE LARVA...

      it curls and twists in the liquid, soaking the alcohol into
      it's pulp...

      She takes a SIP, letting the LARVA curl around her tongue...
      swallows it down... as a GUY takes a seat to her left - his
      hair is shiny, slick black licorice.

      In GORGE'S apartment his lips move, ANGIE'S echoing to match.

                   I thought you weren't allowed to

      RICK RAPE laughs, throwing his head back and slapping his
      knee - EXAGGERATED.

      ANGIE EXITS the ELEVATOR on the 3rd floor - a modern,
      minimalist building... RICK RAPE is with her, close behind.

      They come to an apartment door; RICK RAPE pushes her, from
      behind, up against the door - VIOLENT... her right hand SLAPS
      a PALM IDENTIFICATION SENSOR alongside the door and it
<b>      WHISPERS OPEN.
</b>
      ANGIE snaps a heel; they stumble in.

      ANGIE'S place is some kind of overdecorated, SCHITZOPHRENIC
      blend of GIRLIE/GEEKY/PORN. Shafts of NICOTINE SUNLIGHT
      filter through patterned curtains.

      She crawls along a plush WHITE FUR RUG... RICK RAPE
      follows... he licks his lips - an automatic gesture - and
      begins to UNBUTTON HIS PANTS. ANGIE, on her hands and knees,

      KABLE has RICK RAPE up in the air, holding him like a BARBELL
      - with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. He
      brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN BAT

      ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCLEAR
      with EMOTION.

      KABLE tosses RICK RAPE'S broken body into the bedroom... then
      falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face in
      his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS.

      GORGE is paralyzed.

      ANGIE says the words, but they don't match her eyes.     KABLE
      just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation.

                             GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd)

      GORGE/ANGIE says NOTHING.       The ELEVATOR DOOR whispers open -

      HACKMAN is standing there with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN.

      KABLE TAKES IT IN THE CHEST; he's BLOWN OFF HIS FEET, through
      a wall and into an apartment opposite the ELEVATOR.

      HACKMAN grabs ANGIE'S wrist, drags her onto the ELEVATOR and
      waits a BEAT, smiling pleasantly. The ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES.

      KABLE is ON HIS BACK in rubble. His chest is a BLACK,
      SMOKING HOLE... but as the smoke clears we see that his BODY
      ARMOR has ABSORBED THE BLAST. He's groggy, in excruciating
      pain, wind knocked out of him - but ALIVE.

      TWO GUYS in GAS MASKS and RUBBER SUITS are watching him from
      the next room as he attempts to STRUGGLE TO HIS KNEES; KABLE
      has obviously interrupted something.

      hands folded in front of him, patiently; the SHOTGUN - still

                   Anybody in there?

      The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLING,
      NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE.

      HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH
      BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide with
      TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious.

      GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his
      chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he
      speaks, ANGIE echoes:

      but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL'S
      legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep.

      The GUY is confused - where'd she go? He looks to ANGIE.
      HACKMAN headlocks him from behind, and slowly - making eye
      contact with GORGE/ANGIE the entire time - SNAPS HIS NECK.

      ANGIE'S eyes stream tears; GORGE is in ECSTASY.

      KABLE grabs HACKMAN with both hands, RIPS HIM OUT OF THE
      ELEVATOR and SLAMS HIM into a WALL. A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to
      the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER. HACKMAN'S FACE erupts
      with BLOOD.

      HACKMAN SWINGS BLIND with the BOWIE KNIFE, once, twice - the
      blade misses KABLE, backpedaling, by fractions of inches;
      displacing some SERIOUS AIR... HACKMAN lets it FLY. The
      BOWIE whistles past KABLE'S FACE and THUNKS into the wall
      behind him, four inches deep.

      HACKMAN smears the BLOOD from his eyes and brings up the
      SHOTGUN, but KABLE is quick - instead of trying to move away,
      HE STEPS IN, pushing the barrel STRAIGHT DOWN as HACKMAN
      FIRES. The BIG HIT puts a CRATER in the floor and takes out
      a set of HACKMAN'S toes.

      KABLE kicks the SHOTGUN from HACKMAN'S hands and brings up
      his own WEAPON to close the deal...

      ... as the GLASS WALLS of the LOBBY EXPLODE.

      MORE SLAYERS are MOVING IN.

      KABLE releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs ANGIE and

</b>
      CASTLE'S ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY.

      Balconies, underlit DOMES, lush landscaping, abstract
      statues, waterfalls... tiny cameras everywhere... and not a
      soul in sight.

      KABLE drops over a wall and onto grass.               Wind in the leaves,
      cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE.

      He keeps to the trees, making his way toward the central
<b>      MANSION.
</b>
      THEN: the sound of DOGS... they come in a PACK, loping across
      the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES...

      KABLE readies his gun to take them out - but the DOGS run
      RIGHT PAST HIM. They round a corner and DISAPPEAR. Weird.

      KABLE looks up, spots a CAMERA... and another, and another...
      stands to reason he's been MARKED already.

      He walks out INTO THE OPEN.

<b>155   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION - NIGHT                                              155
</b>
      The GIANT FRONT DOORS of the MANSION are OPEN.              KABLE walks
      right in.

      The interior is HUGE... and EMPTY. NO FURNITURE, no art; no
      people of course. Could anyone possibly live here?

      He explores...

</b>
      AND THEN - at the FAR END of a large, empty HALL:

      A LITTLE GIRL, 5 - is sitting on the floor by herself,
      playing with DOLLS, making them walk and talk.

      KABLE'S eyes go wide.        He starts to walk toward her, slowly
      at first...

      ... and finally breaking into a run - until:

      He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling
      to the ground. The GIRL doesn't react. KABLE pounds on the
      glass...

                                KABLE (cont'd)
<b>                   DELIA!

      ... then looks closer, running his fingers across the SMOOTH

<b>                             KEN CASTLE (O.S.)
</b>                   Not bad for video, eh?

      The VOICE comes from UNSEEN SPEAKERS; it seems to be
      everywhere at once, intimate.

                             KEN CASTLE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                   The latest and greatest... defy you
                   to tell it from real life. You
                   imagine porn on this thing?

      KABLE wants to EXPLODE - but he contains himself. He's
      playing CASTLE'S GAME, and the RULES are still UNDEFINED.

      Then - MUSIC: The SOUND of a SWINGIN' HI-HAT from down a long
      corridor -

      t - t - tssss, t - t - tssss, t - t - tsss...

      KABLE walks toward the source; a bass and piano pick up the
      groove.

<b>157   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS                        157
</b>
      He comes to a BALLROOM - empty, like everything else; shiny
      hardwood floor for DANCING.

      A SPOTLIGHT pops on from above, illuminating KEN CASTLE.
      He's wearing a T-SHIRT and JEANS. Every instinct tells KABLE
      to go after him - but he holds back. Who knows if it's even
      real? And then CASTLE starts to SING...

      ... or more precisely, LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA, I've
      Got You Under My Skin... CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOKE:

      I've got you under my skin

      I've got you deep in the heart of me
      So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
      I've got you under my skin...

      He's snapping his fingers, putting on the moves... THEN -
      from behind curtains - a half dozen SLAYERS appear. We
      RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED, BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison,
      the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are
      wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES.

      KABLE grips his weapon, but the men are UNARMED; instead,
      they fall in on the beat and go into a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE
      behind CASTLE...

      I'd sacrifice anything come what might
      For the sake of having you near
      In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
      And repeats, and repeats in my ear...

      KABLE notices SHADOWY FIGURES around the perimeter of the
      room... glasses, beards, pony tails - silently, the GEEK
      SQUAD has moved in and taken position. They move their hands
      in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a
      DANCER: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS... kick
      with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a
<b>      ROCKETTE.
</b>
      Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the
      SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall, where a VIDEO
      SCREEN BEGINS TO PLAY: it is footage of the GEEK SQUAD
      busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING
      EVERYONE. ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away.

      Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
      Use your mentality, wake up to reality...
      But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP -
      before I give in
      Cause I've got you, under my skin...

      KABLE hits his breaking point. He brings up his WEAPON to
      open up on the SLAYERS... CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS have
      taken care of that.

      KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLAYERS
      break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out
      they're flesh and blood after all.

      CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his
      SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand
      combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces...
      it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS,
      right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men,
      blood on his hands.

      CASTLE applauds; the GEEKS follow suit.

                stupido. My house, my rules.

      CASTLE walks away, leaving his back open to KABLE seemingly
      without concern, toward a side door.

                           KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                Come on, I want to show you
                something.

      Tracking along the hallway, MEDIUM CLOSE, profile:

      CASTLE walks along, confidently, KABLE following. The
      background is a black, glittering STARSCAPE.

      Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF
      THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt. CRATERS and
      LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks
      along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all
      tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH
      rising majestically in the dark heavens.

      They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA
      regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard,
      bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank
      of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on.

      At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting
      baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in
      a FLEX BRACE.

      The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS.

      CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him...
      HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   We're talking every Slayer,

      CASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN; HACKMAN stops dancing, jogs over,
      picks up the ball and resumes shooting.

      CASTLE narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he
      walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER.

<b>                             KEN CASTLE

      CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWAY
<b>      FROM HIS FACE.

                   stars, presidents - and not one
                   would be the wiser.

      Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently

                   much damn well anything I figure
                   they ought to do.

      HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, at
      a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE
<b>      KNIFE...
</b>
                              KEN CASTLE(cont'd)
                   For instance.

      KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS THE
      TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style.
      KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it -
      but leaving his face UNPROTECTED...

      HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face,
      connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this
      time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and
      WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder with
      a sickening POP.

      KABLE works around HACKMAN, gets him in a HEADLOCK and
      SQUEEZES... still gripping the knife hand, immobilizing it...
      HACKMAN is choking, BEAT RED... for long, brutal seconds the
      life drains out of him... finally, HACKMAN'S eyes roll back;
      he GOES LIMP. KABLE takes the BOWIE KNIFE from HACKMAN'S
      dead fingers.

      He struggles to his feet, dripping sweat and blood.

                ... which makes my next move pretty
                easy to figure.

      KABLE comes at CASTLE FAST, bringing the KNIFE around to open
      his throat like a PEZ DISPENSER...

      His arm FREEZES IN MID AIR, the BLADE inches from contact.

      This is gut-wrenching for KABLE -- after tasting freedom, he

      and SLICES OPEN HIS OWN LEG.

      CASTLE throws a funky KARATE KICK and nails KABLE in the
      jaw... then a haymaker to the GUT, doubling KABLE over.

      He lets KABLE swing the KNIFE just short of his face as he
      backs away.

<b>                             KEN CASTLE

                   he?

      CASTLE is enjoying the hell out of himself. He uppercuts
      KABLE, snapping his head back... then shakes out his
      knuckles.

                              KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Oww!

      KABLE swings his OPEN HAND around - CASTLE choreographs it
      perfectly: KABLE'S nails rake across CASTLE'S STOMACH,
      MARKING HIM UP like BRUCE LEE in Enter The Dragon. CASTLE
      strikes a pose to match.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Lucky shot.
                       (grins)
                   OK, not really.

      He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KABLE
      to the floor.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   I need an audience, boys.

      A DOOR OPENS at the far end of the court; KABLE looks up
      slowly, afraid of what he knows he'll see:

      ANGIE and DELIA are led into the room. ANGIE presses herself                *
      close to DELIA, holding her shoulders protectively.                         *

      She keeps her distance from the GEEK SQUAD escorts and tries            *
      to block DELIA from them - there is raw fear and anger in her           *
      eyes; the GEEK SQUAD are not overtly violent or menacing, but           *
      ANGIE seems acutely aware that they are lethal. DELIA seems             *
      oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation.                   *

      CASTLE kicks KABLE across the floor, toward them.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   That's right, you crawl on your
                   belly like a toad...
                       (he looks to the GEEK
                        SQUAD, sheepish)
                   Is this bad? I'm really bad.

      He gives KABLE a last kick; KABLE collapses in front of his
      DAUGHTER... she looks down at him, curiously.                           *

      He looks up at DELIA, eyes soaked with emotion... then to               *
      ANGIE. They share a moment of intense eye contact - we feel             *
      that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of              *
      what is the best action to take strategically; she is looking           *
      to KABLE for a clue.                                                    *

      KABLE'S eyes go back to DELIA; he tries to reach up and                 *
      gently touch her face...

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   That's sweet.

      CASTLE steps on KABLE'S hand, pinning it to the floor.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Alright boys, you ready? A true
                   test.

      He steels his eyes on KABLE and concentrates.

      KABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIA'S THROAT.

      ANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at            *
      her and she FREEZES, paralyzed. We can see her body strain              *
      against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes...                     *

      KABLE is FIGHTING IT with all his will, his whole body

                  more fight in you... but I think

                  Shh.

      The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away... He              *
      looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he                  *
      seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS                   *
      EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARDS.               *

      Suddenly:

      KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one
      quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the
      floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a
      hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into
      his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short...

      KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the
      knife away from CASTLE'S belly.

      CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE, KABLE loses
      his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained...
      CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE. He fights back -
      every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin &
      Yang, veins rising in his neck...

      Then KABLE senses an opportunity:

      shoves it in deeper - CASTLE'S EYES BULGE. Finally KABLE
      TWISTS the KNIFE and lifts CASTLE OFF THE GROUND.

      KABLE'S body relaxes; he tosses the knife across the floor...
      then turns to face his family.

<b>167   INT. KABLE'S CAR - DAY                                                  167

      SHOOTING STARS fly past us in the dark... the SAME IMAGE WE
      STARTED WITH... only instead of an underground train carrying
      SOLDIERS to battle...

      The TUNNEL ENDS; we break from the side of a mountain into
<b>      BLUE SKY AND SUNLIGHT.
</b>
      KABLE is driving on the open highway... ANGIE is in the
      passenger seat, asleep, head pressed up against the window
      glass.

      KABLE checks the rear view window; makes eye contact with
      DELIA, who is suspended in a lightweight car seat in the back
      seat.

<b>                             KABLE
</b>                   You good, sweetheart?

      DELIA nods.

      KABLE allows himself a smile, puts his eyes back on the road.
      ANGIE slowly reaches for KABLE'S hand, she rubs her thumb on
      his tattoo - "I am right here with you" - and falls back
      asleep.

      The CAMERA tilts up, stares out the front window and moves
      into the giant sun.
