</b>          The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A
          broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its
          way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the

          The taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier
          gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him.
          He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward
          camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward
          steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called "PREW"
          for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears
          an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where
          chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the
          door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G

</b>          A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs
          out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed
          broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny
          and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his
          face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.

          Maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes
          have been removed. Prew follows his glance.

<b>          TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET
</b>          Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street.
          He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles
          it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances
          through the screen door, goes in.
                         
<b>          INT. DAYROOM - DAY
</b>                         
<b>                         MEDIUM SHOT
</b>          The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc.
          Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is
          empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool
          table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle
          mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the
          wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.
                         
<b>          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
</b>          The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew
          addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly.
          He watches the balls hurry around the table.

           the Compny? What's your name?
                         
          The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly.
          CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN,
          almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful,
          has a neatly-trimmed moustache.

           like that.
                         
          Warden goes out of the Dayroom. Prew puts up the cue and
          follows him.

          ahead. They go into the Orderly Room.

          MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First
          Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers,
          etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli.

<b>                         ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>          Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now,
          stares at the other man as if still incredulous.

           best on this whole Rock.
                         
          In b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at
          Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully.

</b>           That's true.
                         
          Maggio wags his head, bends over to pick up wastepaper
          basket.

          Prewitt, Mazzioli and Maggio spring to attention. The screen
          door bangs and CAPTAIN DANA HOLMES enters shot. He wears
          cavalry boots and spurs. He is about forty, unsure of
          himself, therefore always too certain with his men. He nods
          pleasantly.

          Holmes goes into his office. Warden jerks his thumb toward
          the door. Prewitt goes into the office. Warden follows him.

          placard on it reads: CAPTAIN HOLMES. A smaller desk nearby
          has a placard' reading: 1ST SERGEANT WARDEN. Warden seats
          himself at this desk. On the walls are framed photographs of
          prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy. On

          MEDIUM SHOT 22 Karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing
          table, brushing her hair -- steadily, gracefully, enjoying
          the sensual pleasure of it. Karen is a woman of moods and
          tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse. A car is heard
          pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping. Karen's brush
          strokes become faster, rougher. The front door is heard
          opening and Holmes' voice calling, "Karen." She does not
          answer. Holmes enters. He seems to have had a few drinks.
          Through the following, Karen continues brushing her hair.

          A jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and

          walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called
          decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from
          Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer
          and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door
          sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At

          wagged edge at Fatso, roars:

          Fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it
          pointed towards Maggio and Warden. Warden deliberately turns
          his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio.

          He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his
          own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has
          broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing
          Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom.

          In b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards
          the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass.

          a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express

</b>          Warden is pinning some notices on a bulletin board. Prew sits
          on the bench against the wall, miserable, elbows on knees,
          chin in hand. There is a quiet tenseness in the room. Warden
          looks over at Prew, turns back to the bulletin board.
          Mazzioli gets up from his desk, wanders aimlessly to a
          window. The screen door slams and Leva enters, eating a candy
          bar.

          The others tense at the word "Stockade," glare at Leva as if
          he had no right to mention it. Their fear of the place, now
          that it is imminent even for another soldier, is shown on
          their faces. There is a long pause.

          Galovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as
          he does. Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to
          change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize

          Galovitch quickly and cleverly. Galovitch is more lumbering
          but not awkward. His heavy blows stagger Prew several times.
          Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. He never
          throws a punch at the other's head.

          and bleeding and there is a welt under one eye. Galovitch is
          unmarked but grunting now from Prew's constant jabs at his
          stomach. He seems perplexed, as before, by his opponent+s
          tactics.

          tagging after him. Holmes stops and watches the fight. There

          Taps. The first note is incredibly clear and loud and
          certain. It is held longer than most Buglers hold it. The
          second note is daringly short, abrupt. The last note of the
          first phrase rises, peals out, heartfelt. Two men come into
          the shot, smoking. They stop, turn toward the Bugler, listen
          attentively. One of them flips away his cigarette. The Taps
          continues through the following.

</b>          Lieutenant Ross is hailed by the loading detail -- about ten
          men. He grabs a BAR and ammunition from them and runs into
          the barracks. The loading detail is working feverishly, same
          carrying ammunition into the barracks, others picking up
          empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling
          them toward the Supply Room.

          men are hoarse from shouting, red-eyed, puffing from
          excitement and exertion. Two Jap planes swoop past and the
          full-throated umbrella of fire lets loose. Lieutenant Ross
          clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the BAR

          remembers something from the broadcast of the morning. Then

          see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the
          opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. It is
          also manned by three MPs. There is a startled cry from Prew.

          heads for a high sandtrap. The spot is full on him as he
