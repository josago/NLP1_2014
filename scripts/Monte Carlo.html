          ALICE PERRY (30s), her innate and amiable authority eclipsed
          only by a self-consciousness about her hair, afraid perhaps
          that she hasn't lived up to the promise of its red color,

          Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are
          simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination
          that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior.

          holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a
          sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast.
          The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY (30's) who tears recipes

          Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup,
          Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference.
          She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls
          leap back with a shriek, shakes her head.
          The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the

          her, a game of cards laid out on her tray table.

                         
          Alice brings her seat to the upright position as instructed
          and sits, hyper-alert, looking at her closed window shade.
          A beat.
          She reaches out and raises the shade a tentative crack,
          flooding their row with light.
          She glances furtively around the cabin, then inches the shade
          higher, drawing in a sharp breath at what she sees.
          She flings the shade up.
          ALL OF PARIS is laid out below her; a magical nautilus-like
          wheel with the Eiffel Tower as its central axle.
          Her breath steams the window as she drinks it all in.

          in the view and squeeze Alice's arm with a smile.

          Esprit de Corps tour members disembark from their bus in
          front of a comically narrow and vertical Baroque hotel with

          The women lower the travel brochure and its photograph of a
          tidy well-appointed suite, to regard the actual one in which
          they stand; dingy, impossibly small, crowded by an armoire

          twin beds and a military-style cot.

          fitfully behind her.
          She looks down at the cellphone in her hands, scrolling
          through her speed dial to stop at: 1. Richard.
          She hesitates with her thumb over the "call" button.

          Water pours in sheets from the sky as Alice, Meg and Emma
          splash down the Rue de Rivoli and duck beneath the shelter of
          the hotel's canopy.
          They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their

          the overhang on the far side of the entrance, as a camera
          flashes in taking Emma's picture.
          Emma smiles, blinks, confused as another photographer

          sportscoat, pauses in collecting leeks when he spots Meg on
          the other side of the open stall.
          He watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce,
          lifting a tomato to her nose, inhaling with a private smile.
          Meg bites into the tomato, spurting juice onto her cheek and
          down her front.
          She looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away, stopping
          when she catches Bernard smiling with amusement.
          Meg rolls her eyes with self-deprecation and moves on along
          the line of stalls.
          Bernard pays for his purchase and follows, finding Meg at
          another stall where a FRENCHWOMAN tries to communicate how to
          prepare the fish they both admire.
          Meg nods, not entirely understanding, but getting enough of

          The woman grabs some newspaper, wrapping the fish, and
          thrusts it towards Meg with a smile.

          From the edge of the dance floor, NIKOLAI LUDOVIC (late 30s),
          squat, bald, completely nondescript but for his white tie and
          tails, watches Emma ardently.
          He stops a waiter, taking his tray of Champagne flutes.

                         
          Emma spins to find Nikolai at her elbow, grinning, holding up

          Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile,
          watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks.

          match her moves, insinuates himself.
          She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her
          back to evade him.
          Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo

          Jean-Pierre shakes hands with Nikolai and kisses Emma, tips

          Emma and Nikolai shake hands with Bernard, then turn and head
          for the marina, trailed by one of the paparazzi while the
          other two pause to reload their cameras.
          As Bernard hops on his moped to zip away, the revolving doors
          turn and Cordelia steps out, talking on her cellphone,
