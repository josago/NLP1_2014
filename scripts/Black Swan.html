           A SPOTLIGHT slices black space.
                         
           In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned.
           Beautiful and pure.
                         
           The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as
           air and carefree.
                         
           She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching.
                         
           Scared, she peers into the darkness.
                         
           She moves now, looking, growing more frantic.
                         
           Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her.
           She stumbles backwards, frightened.
                         
           She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true
           form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART.
                         
           He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell.
                         
           She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her
           body, sensing something happening to her. Something
           terrifying.
                         
           She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears
           beneath the beast's cape.
                         
           She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN

<b>          2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
</b>                         
           In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the
           same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream.
                         
           The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was
           a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly.
                         
           The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks
           towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it.
                         
           Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed.
           Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are
           atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She
           arches them, doing her first extensions of the day.

<b>          3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3
</b>                         
           The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A
           large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely.
                         
           Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her
           morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and
           legs in precise and rhythmic motions.
                         
           The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum.
           Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as
           she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained
           in a ballerina's bun.
                         
           Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element.
                         
           She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen.

           Still no answer.
                         
           Nina continues to stretch.
                         
                         
<b>          4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4
</b>                         
           Nina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a
           POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her.

          They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag
          with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct
          tape, ribbon, thread, etc.

          Nina smiles, comforted, and begins taking her vitamins.
                         
          Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her.
          Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms
          through the sleeves.

           Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small

           She shrugs and shakes her head.
                         
           Erica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles.
           Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt.
                         
           Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her
           head.

<b>          5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5

           Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at
           her faint reflection in the train's window.
                         
           Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track,
           snapping her awake.
                         
           In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA
           standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music
           playing through iPod earphones.
                         
           Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that
           exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way.
           Mirroring her.
                         
           Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl.
           Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems
           IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point.

           The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina
           sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face,
           but her view's obscured.
                         
           The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches
           the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she
           doesn't see the girl.

           She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few
           other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They
           all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,
           wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.
                         
           She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima
           ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.
                         
           Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to
           the STAGE DOOR.

           SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon
           onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters.
                         
           Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a
           moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors.
                         
           In the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip.

           sweatshirts and insulated pants.
                         
           Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the
           company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the
           unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense.

          then taps another. A selection process of some kind.

           HUMMING the score to Swan Lake.
                         
           She makes small motions with her feet and hands, going

           Although her movement is incredibly precise, there's a

           fear tinged with melancholy.
                         
           Leroy waves his arm. The music and Nina stop abruptly.

           Nina flees to the door. Pauses. She peeks back and sees that

           passion exceeding coordination.
                         
           Lily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed.

           pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand.

           She digs her nails into Nina's hands.

           The overworked COSTUMER checks each seam, pulling the costume

           Nina slowly enters Beth's room, but remains at the threshold.
                         
           Beth sits in a wheelchair faced towards the window. Sleeping.
                         
           Nina gets up the nerve and quietly walks further in, trying
           not to wake her.
                         
           Nina pulls out the tube of lipstick from her bag and gently
           places it on the hospital table.
                         
           She pulls out the diamond earrings, sets them down.
                         
           Followed by the makeup compact, the pack of cigarettes, a
           needle and thread, and an emory board.
                         
           A hand suddenly GRABS Nina's arm.

           Stunned, Nina's unable to answer.
                         
           Beth follows her gaze to the random items on her table.

           She hears RUSTLING, then WHISPERING.
                         
           Nina looks around the room. The paintings of herself seem to
           move slightly. Blink. Mouths move.
                         
           They whisper: "Sweet girl" and then start chanting "My turn,
           my turn, my turn!"
                         
           Nina cups her hands over her ears, trying to block it out.
                         
           She hears a BANG and looks towards the door. No one's there.
                         
           She glimpses the mirror, which reflects down the hallway. She
           sees her Double rushing towards the room.

           A pain shoots through her shoulder. She SCREAMS,
           instinctively reaching for it.
                         
           She quickly yanks off the sweater and looks at the vanity

           The door opens and catches on the doorjamb.

           Nina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks.
                         
           Blood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red.
                         
           Nina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY
           BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps
           hang off of it.
                         
           The door flings open.

           She finally gets the door all the way shut.

           She removes a slipper off one foot. Her big and second toe,
           and her pinky and fourth toe are stuck together. Puzzled, she
           peels them apart.
                         
           She removes her other slipper and finds the same toes
           completely FUSED, forming two large toes with double toenails
           on either side of the middle toe.

          there either.
                         
          She slowly opens the door to the wardrobe...
                         
          And finds it empty. No body whatsoever.
                         
          She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection
          staring back at her.
                         
          She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something.
                         
          She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her
          hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood.
                         
          It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint
          red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain.
                         
          She feels inside for confirmation.
                         
          And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach.
                         
          She pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside.
          Blood begins flowing more rapidly.
                         
          She drops the mirror.

           White Swan in 5.
                         
          In a daze, she sits down at the vanity, and finishes applying
          the rest of the White Swan's makeup.

           Nina dances the final Pas de Deux as the White Swan. Losing
           blood by the second, everything is woozy and blurry.
                         
           She can't do all the steps, but her performance is pained,
           making it poignant.
                         
           A spot of red begins to soak through at the center of her
           costume.
                         
           The music turns ominous, and VON ROTHBART, the evil sorcerer,
           comes onto stage.
                         
           Nina dances away from him, back upstage, towards the cliff.
           It's time for her final leap.
                         
           Her energy fading, she teeters up the stairs of the set. One
           step at a time...
                         
           She gets to the top, takes one last look around, at all the
           eyes watching her.
                         
           She notices a familiar face in the audience: HER MOTHER. She
           watches with a profound sadness, tears streaking her cheeks.
                         
           In the front of Nina's costume, a dark circle has started to
           form. Her blood fully seeping through.
                         
           And Nina leaps...

           She falls through an endless void, her eyes closed.
                         
           She slowly twists around in the air, so that she's falling
           backwards.
                         
           She hears something. Soft and muffled.
                         
           The faint sound of applause.

           The sound of applause is now loud, uproarious.
                         
           A group of BALLERINAS surround the mattress, clapping for
           her, each one dressed as a WHITE SWAN.
                         
           Leroy pushes through the group to get to her.

          Nina's abdomen.
                         
          Leroy follows her gaze and discovers the spot of blood, which
          has grown in size.
