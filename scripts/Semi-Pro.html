</b>
          We hear the faint sounds of a crowd cheering on Kobe Bryant.
          The real Bob Costas does narration.

<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
</b>          Before the NBA was the NBA, there
          was another basketball league in
          America...
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: This is real ABA footage. A series of
          great plays are made by ABA stars.

<b>           BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
</b>          .From 1967 to 1976, there was the
          American Basketball Association. A
          maverick minor-league that would
          change the game forever. The ABA
          made the fast break FAST...
          Invented the three point shot...
          And introduced the world to
          something called the Slam Dunk
          Contest.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and
          dunks in the world's first dunk contest. David Thompson
          finishes an Alley Oop.

<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
</b>          Singer Pat Boone owned the Oakland
          Oaks. Wilt Chambelain coached the
          Conquistadors. I myself was the
          young voice of the St. Louis
          Spirits.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A young Bob Costas broadcasts from St.
          Louis, looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed jacket.

<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.O.)
</b>          Players like Dr. J, Ice-man George
          Gervin and Moses Malone were as
          entertaining as they come. But
          despite the league's flair,
          convincing fans to show up for
          games was often a struggle.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The infamous TV interview where Freddy
          Lewis wins a 'race horse.' Footage of 'Dime Beer Night.'
          Footage of the Kentucky Colonials fielding a cheerleader as
          one of their starting five.

<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.0. )
</b>          For owners, promotional ideas
          became an art form all to
          themselves.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The Miami Ball Girls dance in bikinis
          (In truth, some of the girls were still in high school).

<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
</b>          One night, the Nets went as far as
          to give a free gerbil to it's first
          fifty fans... There were plenty of
          punches too, giving the National
          Hockey League a run for it's money.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins, who turns
          and punches the guy in the face.

<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
</b>          Yes, the ABA had a style all it's
          own. The hair was big, the shorts
          were short and the ball was red,
          white and blue.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Harry 'The fat Mexican guy' dances.

<b>           BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
</b>          In 1976, rumors of a merger spread
          throughout the league. In the end,
          only four teams would join the NBA
          and survive.

<b>          QUICK CUTS: THE PACERS. THE NUGGETS. THE NETS. THE SPURS.
</b>
<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
</b>          Teams like the Kentucky Colonels
          and the Virginia Squires would
          disappear forever. But their spirit
          still lives on to this day.

<b>          EXT. A BASKETBALL STADIUM - 1976
</b>
          We hear a crowd going crazy.

<b>          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
</b>          Here, we present the legend of the
          ABA... Exactly as it happened.
          Some FUNKY MUSIC plays.

<b>          BOB COSTAS (V_O_)

</b>

<b>          TITLE CARD: ANAHEIM AMIGO STADIUM, 1976.
</b>          CLOSE ON: A logo of a basketball with a sombrero on it.

<b>          "LET'S GO AMIGOS!"
</b>          Welcome to the American Basketball Association. A fan chugs
          his beer and throws some guacamole.
          The crowd screams and curses at MONIX, mid 40'S -- talented,
          but past his prime. (There are three leading characters in
          this movie. This is the old rock. Think Nolte in 48 hours.
          Cosner in Durham. Newman in Slap Shot).

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          The Amigos are up by one here.
          They'll need to find a way to stop
          Monix. He checks the clock,
          waits... And now drives the lane...
          MONIX suddenly takes a HUGE HIT, TOTALLY SLAMMED by a big
          asshole, PETRELLI. He flies into the crowd -- everyone
          erupts, screaming with glee.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          Ooh, Monix gets taken out hard.
          Some tough love from Patrelli.

<b>          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
</b>          WHAT!? Where's the foul on that?
          That was all ball.
          (covering mic, screaming)
          Jesus Christ Leonard! Let them play
          for once! This ain't fuckin'
          Greenpeace!

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          Some might say that was a close
          call, but these referees have done
          a nice job tonight.

<b>          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
</b>          'Oh please. These refs SUCK.
          Still stuck in the crowd. Monix struggles to get back on the
          court. The crowd shoves him around, twisting his ankle,
          slapping him. The crowd is nuts.

</b>
<b>          DRUNK LADY
</b>          Hey Monix, want a sip?
          Monix is confused, until the woman throws the beer in his
          face.

<b>          DRUNK LADY
</b>          (smart ass)
          Oops.
          She and her friends laugh. Monix says nothing. Instead, he
          holds his aching back and limps up to the foul line, annoyed.

<b>          PATRELLI
</b>
<b>          (SMILING)
</b>          Sorry, Monix, I got pushed.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          Well, it looks like the Amigos are
          in trouble here. Monix is a ninety
          percent shooter, if he can hit both
          of these free throws, it's over.
          Monix performs his ancient free throw ritual: Three dribbles
          and a quick spin of the ball. But he MISSES.

<b>          DRUNK LADY
</b>
<b>          HA. NICE SHOT MONIX! YOU FUCKIN'
</b>
<b>          SUCK, MAN! YOU SUCK DONKEY DICK.
</b>          Again, Monix ignores the drunk lady.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          They dodged a bullet there. But
          Monix still has one last chance to
          tie it up.
          Monix focuses on his ritual again.

<b>          DRUNK LADY
</b>
<b>          WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? SHOOT THE
</b>
<b>          BALL YOU PUSSY!
</b>          Monix aims at the basket, about to shoot, but then suddenly

<b>          WHIPS THE BALL HARD AT THE LADY, PEGGING HER IN THE FACE.
</b>
<b>          DRUNK LADY
</b>
<b>          AHH!
</b>
<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          (re: nailing the girl)
          And the second free throw sails
          wide.

<b>          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
</b>          Yes! He just pegged a chick! That's
          the greatest thing I've ever seen.
          The lady runs on court and attacks Monix, her boyfriend jumps
          in -- Monix hits her boyfriend with some quick hockey
          punches. The benches clear, everyone is punching everybody.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)

          And we've got a little bit of

          Lou?

<b>          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)

          Lou Redwood takes his headphones off, climbs over the
          announcer's table and jumps into the fight.

</b>
          Monix is beat up pretty bad. He dabs his cut with toilet
          paper.

<b>          SCHNACK (O.S. )
</b>          Want one?
          SCHNACK, the owner, carries a six pack of Schlitz.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          I'll take two.
          Schnack hands them over. Monix might speak, but he drinks
          instead.

<b>          SCHNACK
</b>          So, Monix. The trade went through.

<b>          SCHNACK
</b>          That score board.
          ANGLE ON: Pieces of an old scoreboard are crammed into the
          back of the locker room.

          Some hot girls in shorts hold up a sign that says 'ALL STAR

          CLARENCE enters out of the tunnel, he takes a bite of a
          Hershey bar, then gestures to the crowd, giving the
          international symbol for 'Let's get funky.'

          Clarence tosses the half eaten candy bar, wipes his hands off
          on his jersey and jogs right out onto the court during the
          game, TAGGING HIS TEAMMATE OUT as if it were pick up.

</b>          Downtown dribbles left, then right
          a little shake and bake through the
          legs -- double teamed now, he's got
          Twiggy Munson open under the
          basket. Downtown, still with the
          ball, dribbles behind his back,
          they triple him, he's got Munson
          and Ellis wide open under the hoop,
          but look at these moves!
          The entire other team leaves their men and guards Clarence
          five on one, but Clarence never passes. His four teammates
          watch from under the basket.

</b>          Downtown has all five guys on him --
          He sprints to the corner and forces
          up a fade away three... YES! Wow.

</b>          Yeah. Sorry man--

<b>          KYLE

</b>          No. Ha.

<b>          KYLE
</b>          Great back door cut for the lay-up

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Kyle, can you give us a second? We

<b>          THE COMMISH
</b>          A huge fan base. A brand new

<b>          I KNOW WHAT I SAID!

</b>          He's right.

</b>          Yeah, that's the fairest way.

<b>          COMMISH
</b>          These four teams DO have the best

</b>          Yeah, maybe we should finish the

<b>          COMMISH
</b>          This plan sounds like a lot of fun,

<b>          LOSING OWNER #2
</b>          Actually, the terms of a merger can
          only be approved by a league

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          I ran the numbers. All we have to
          do is win about eighty-two percent
          of our remaining games.

</b>          What does symbolic mean?

<b>          DUKES
</b>          I don't know. But they said I need

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          I don't know what your bank is
          talking about. That is a real
          check. I signed it myself.

<b>          DUKES
</b>          It's written in glitter, dude.
          Can't you just give me, like, a
          regular sized one?

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          I don't get it. People are usually
          able to cash these. Maybe you
          should try another bank.

          through every single playoff game.
          You didn't see action once. And now
          you walk around wearing the ice
          like you're Bill Russel. Well you
          ain't.

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          Oh, you're just jealous.

<b>          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
</b>          Yeah, Monix played solid minutes,
          for lots of teams. He's played in
          the NBA, that's more than you can
          say.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Whatever. At least I never sat on
          the bench and then called myself a
          champion. You didn't do shit for
          that Celtic team. If I was Dave
          Cowens, I'd yank that ring right
          off your neck.
          That was a pretty heated exchange. Monix looks like he's got
          something to say, but he doesn't. Clarence has the last word.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          He doesn't wear it on his finger
          because he knows he didn't earn it.
          He didn't even play.

          Jackie addresses his team before tip off.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Alright. Now, a lot of people out
          there are writing us off. A lot
          people are saying things like
          'Jackie Moon is an offensive
          liability.' They're saying 'Flint's
          turnovers led to sixty fast break
          points per game.'
          (Making this up)
          They're saying 'Bee Bee's retarded
          brother is so retarded that his
          eyes look too big,. Like a French
          Bulldog.

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          No one said that, man.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (trying to motivate)
          Yes they did. And we're going to

<b>          LET'S GET TROPICAL!
</b>
<b>          MONTAGE: FLINT PLAYS HARDER BUT THEY STILL SUCK.
</b>          GAME 1) JACKIE MOON sprints across the floor tries to get two
          f eet planted in the lane. It's not even close, JACKIE HAS
          TAKEN A GUY DOWN HARD. The ref whistles a blocking foul.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          What!? What did I say?
          Jackie takes a ball and drop kicks it, PUNTING IT high up
          into the rafters.

<b>          BUZZER! FINAL SCORE: COLONELS 111 TROPICS 92.
</b>          GAME 2) MONIX drives the lane, fast and smart -- A no-look
          pass hits Scootsie Double-Day in the shoulder.

</b>
<b>          AH. MY COLLAR BONE!

<b>          BUZZER! FINAL SCORE: SQUIRES 90 TROPICS 70.
</b>          GAME 3) CLARENCE and BEE BEE jog back on Defense.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          I ain't guarding my guy anymore.

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          Why not?

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          He's too'Damn sweaty, man.
          (re: his wet uniform)
          Look at me.

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          Gross. Well, I ain't guarding him.
          Monix notices this discussion.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Quit talking and play defense!
          The sweaty guy backs in on Clarence, posting up top.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          44.
</b>          GAME 5) Jackie Moon plays great defense, rejecting a shot!
          Monix grabs the ball and dribbles on a fast break. Clarence
          trails, in perfect position...

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Right on! I'm open baby! Try a
          behind-the-back!
          Monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass, but Clarence
          isn't ready for anything fundamentally sound -- The ball hits
          him in the nuts.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Ah, shit.

<b>          BUZZER! FINAL SCORE: PIPERS 105 TROPICS 91.

          Angle on a big hotel with fancy lights -- but then we pan to
          reveal: A shitty motel. The 'Jet' is parked at the cheap
          place.

<b>          INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Two twin beds in a crap-box motel room. Monix has the phone
          to his ear, but it just keeps ringing. He'd leave a message
          for Lynn, but answering machines haven't been invented yet.
          He hangs up, looks in the mirror, and now takes his
          Championship ring necklace off.
          He looks at the ring in his hand... And shoves it into his
          duffle bag.

<b>          CLARENCE (O.S.)
</b>          I brought us some ice.
          Monix is startled. Clarence, his roommate for the night,
          enters.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Ice? What for?

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          I don't know, it's free.
          Clarence takes some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts
          crunching.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Want some?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          45.
</b>
<b>          MONIX
</b>          No thanks.
          Now BEE BEE enters, yet another player in the small room.

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          That Root Beer machine took my
          fucking change, man. White people
          are assholes.
          Monix ignores this. Laying back, he focuses on the TV: THE
          CELTICS are playing. Their trapping defense is a thing of
          beauty.
          Clarence walks over and flicks the channels, until he stops
          at 'Love American Style.'

<b>          MONIX
</b>          You turned off the Celtics?

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          I don't watch people play
          basketball. They watch me.
          With that, Clarence pulls out a JOINT and lights it.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          (re: the marijuana)
          What the Hell is that?

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          (as he inhales)
          It's a fucking Egg-McMuffin.
          Monix opens the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his
          face.
          JACKIE EXITS the bathroom, having just taken a shower. He's
          wearing a very small robe. This is now the fourth player
          who's sleeping in this tiny room.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Why don't you shower in your room?

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          My wife is using it. I'll be
          crashing with you guys tonight.

<b>          (NOTICING)
</b>          Ice? Awesome.
          (as he eats ice, re: TV)
          Love American Style? Turn it up.

</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          46.
</b>          Jackie doesn't say a word about the pot. Instead he keeps his
          eyes glued to the TV, then reaches for the joint and SMOKES

<b>          IT.
</b>
<b>          MONIX
</b>          Jackie, have you ever even slept
          with your wife?

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>
<b>          (LYING)
</b>          What? Are you kidding? Try, like,
          every weekend. She's so hot.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Sounds like a great arrangement.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          You guys need to wake up. Quit
          living like it's the 1950's, man.
          Live it up.
          (showing off)
          Hey Clarence, let's have some of
          that smoke, bro.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          I'm pretty sure we have a game
          tomorrow.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (as he inhales)
          This stuff won't affect you. It's
          premium.
          Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He
          stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Well, if this is really going to be
          my life, I might as well be stoned
          like everyone else.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Well said.
          Monix takes the stupid joint. The instant Monix inhales he

<b>          COUGHS LIKE CRAZY.
</b>
<b>          MONIX
</b>          What the Hell is this?

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>          MONIX
</b>          It's harsh.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Take that back.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Take what back?

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          His Mom grows it.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Yeah, in the yard.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Your Mom grew this?

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          It's sweet grass.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Well, I'm finished, thanks.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          What's wrong, my Mom's weed ain't
          good enough for you?

<b>          MONIX
</b>          I guess not.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          C'mon man, have some respect for
          his Mom's weed.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          That's it, I ain't sleeping in the
          same bed as this motherfucker.

<b>          INT. AMIGO STADIUM - ROAD TRIP GAME 6 - NEXT NIGHT

          Television cameras are being set up. A camera man cleans the
          lens.
          Jackie studies the cameras, mesmerized by the idea of
          television. He speaks with the Amigo's manager.

<b>          AMIGO MANAGER
</b>          You want all the fans to sit on one

<b>          (DEMONSTRATING)
</b>          See, the TV cameras are going to

<b>          AMIGO MANAGER
</b>          Actually, that's not a bad idea.
          MEANWHILE, ON THE COURT: Both teams are warming up. Clarence
          now has a new name on his Jersey. There are so many words,
          there is barely space for a number. It's a mess.

<b>          CLARENCE

          you were running Milwaukee's
          offense better than their first
          stringers ever could.
          Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the

<b>          LYNN
</b>          By game time, your team knew where
          Milwaukee was going to be before
          their own players did. The Celtics
          made the right adjustments to win
          that series. And those adjustments
          came from you.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          So, I should be proud of running
          the scout team?

<b>          LYNN
</b>          Dave Cowens put that ring in the
          palm of your hand. And he told you
          to wear it with pride, because you
          were a champion. And he meant it
          too.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          He was being a nice guy. The bench
          is the bench.

<b>          LYNN
</b>          Your whole life, you've bitched
          about people playing selfish. It
          takes a team to win, right?

<b>          LYNN
</b>          But when you're on the team, your
          effort doesn't count? Is that it?

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          If you weren't on the Celtics that

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Watch that needle.

<b>          LYNN
</b>          Answer me. Would they have won?

<b>          MONIX
</b>          I don't know.

<b>          LYNN
</b>          Yes you do. You know.
          Monix looks away for a moment.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Why are you doing this? What does
          any of this matter, anyway?

<b>          LYNN
</b>          What's it matter? You're drinking
          yourself to death!

          you hate yourself!
          Lynn throws the needle. Monix dodges it.

<b>          LYNN
</b>          I made sacrifices! How many years
          did I support you? And finally,
          after all of our blood and sweat
          and bullshit together, you got
          there, Monix! You made it, you won
          an NBA championship ring. It wasn't
          just about you, okay? And I'm sick
          of you acting like you're some kind
          of joke. You didn't blow it. You're
          not a fraud. You're not a fake
          champion. And all the time we spent
          together, fighting for you to get
          to that moment, was not a waste!
          You're a champion, you asshole!

          then checks his knee.

          It's practice. But this isn't basketball, it's DANCE
          PRACTICE. The entire team performs a complicated 'intro-
          dance.'

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          This is practice, okay Clarence? We

          He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever...

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          From now on, I want our afros

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Hey, you're back! Listen, you

          for this number.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Coach?
          Jackie is totally thrown by this. He looks around at the
          team. Clearly, a decision has been made.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          What do you mean, coach?

          What is this? What's going on?
          (staring his team down)
          It's a Mutiny.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Jackie. Don't be like that.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Hold on a second. Last time I
          checked, we didn't live in Flint,
          Russia. We live in Flint, America.
          I'm coach until a new one is
          elected.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Don't make us elect Monix, man.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Don't take it so hard, Jackie.
          You're a great owner. We all know
          that.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Woah. Hold on. Did you just say
          'great owner?'

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Yeah. Everyone thinks so.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Now, when you said great owner,
          were you just saying that? Because

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          We mean it. For real. Monix is just
          more of an X's and O's kind of guy,
          that's all.
          Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off
          his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (re: The whistle)

          Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper
          written in ball point pen. The pages look insane.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (handing him papers)
          And here are some ideas for plays
          I've jotted down. Just thoughts.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Thanks Jackie.
          (to the team)
          The way I see it, any team in this
          league can put together a run. Most
          of our opponents are all flash. If
          we play unselfish, fundamental
          basketball, we can win games.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          I like it. Unselfish, guys.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          66.
</b>
<b>          MONIX
</b>          Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning
          tough team defense, full and half
          court traps, boxing your man out to
          help the team rebound.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Unselfish means sprinting up the
          floor on every fast break NOT
          because you can get a DUNK -- and
          get your DICK SUCKED after the game
          -- but because if you sprint up the
          floor you might pull the defense
          out of position and free a teammate
          up for a high percentage shot.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Wait, so, what's going on with the
          blow jobs?

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          I vote we keep the blow jobs.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (raising his hand)
          All in favor?
          Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Would everyone let the man talk
          please?
          Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up.

<b>          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER
</b>
          The starters have gotten into position, guarded by the scout
          team, in blue jerseys.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          The most important work we do on
          the court is away from the
          basketball.
          Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL,
          deflating it. This gets everyone's attention.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          (re: deflated ball)
          Until you start moving like a real
          team, you practice without a ball.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          67.
</b>          He flings the deflated ball into the bleachers and snaps the
          knife closed.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Alright, Clarence, run the offense.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          I don't get it.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Set a pick for somebody.
          Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Okay, that's kind of a pick, I
          guess. Try standing on the other
          side of Scootsie's man, so you free
          him up to cut into the lane.
          Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him
          to stand.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Widen your stance. Plant your feet.
          Hands back. Like this. Now Scootsie
          GO. Set a pick for Jackie.
          Scootsie cuts across the lane. The team slowly gets i
          rotating faster.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Now Jackie pick Bee Bee's man, and
          rotate to the rim like this...
          Everyone move to the open space.
          And Clarence you swing back out up
          top.
          They've completed the play. Monix stands there, smiling. The
          players look at each other, what's the big deal?

<b>          MONIX
</b>          You know what that was?

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          What.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          A flash to the high side post with
          an outside screen and a back door
          cut. Let's do it again.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Ei 8.

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          Hey, how come you don't have to run
          with us? You're a player, just like
          the rest of us.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          I'm saving my knee for the games.
          Coach's decision. NOW RUN.
          Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform the same
          basic rotation.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          (as they run)
          We're not just rotating, we're
          clearing out, making space. A pass
          and cut can change defensive match-
          ups. Creating seams can give us
          back door looks. Down screens can
          make a team vulnerable to
          penetration.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Hold on. I'm lost.

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          No shit. What's up with all of

</b>          Yeah, what are we, building some
          kind of basketball space. ship?

<b>          MONIX

          The team is still doing the exact same thing. Nothing in
          their moves have changed at all. They're exhausted.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          'Until we puke' is not a figure of

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          What does he mean by 'literally?'

<b>          CLARENCE

</b>          That's bullshit. Keep moving,

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          I don't puke. I can't do it! It's

</b>          Isn't that kind of dangerous?

</b>
<b>          INT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NIGHT
</b>
          An intense game is underway. The Flint team works hard away
          from the ball. As the Monix voice over continues, we watch
          the team move just like in practice. Monix is playing too.
          Note: The team also looks 'hot.' Clarence plays with an even
          bigger afro. Jackie Moon sports a large perm, striped tube
          socks and the whitest thighs you've ever seen.

<b>          MONIX (V.O.)
</b>          .On offense, we share the ball.
          We look for the easy pass, not the
          spectacular pass...
          Jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it. For the first
          time in this sequence, we see the ball. Clarence has a clear
          passing lane -- He feeds Jackie for a lay up.

</b>
<b>          MONIX (V.O.)
</b>          . If a guy's more open than you
          are, he gets the ball...
          Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense. The
          Tropics execute a half court trap. As we watch Monix play, we
          continue to the voice over from practice...

<b>          MONIX (V.0.)
</b>          .On defense, we're going to learn
          to play together. We're going to
          use team traps to pressure people
          into turnovers.
          On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent.
          Monix slaps the ball free. He flips to Clarence who fakes; the
          fast break dunk and dishes to Scootsie.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          Can you believe that? Jumping
          Johnny Johnson actually passed the
          ball.

<b>          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
</b>          It was a great pass, too.
          The other team calls time out.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.O.)
</b>          And Jackie Moon has made several
          great defensive plays down the
          stretch. I tell you, Jackie's not
          afraid to knock people around in
          the lane. He's a monster.

<b>          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
</b>          Like a retard in a China shop.
          A twenty-second time out on the floor, Monix huddles them up.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          (huddling up)
          Listen up. I'll in-bound. Clarence,
          protect the ball and penetrate if
          you can. Kick it out to Scootsie or
          me and everyone crash the boards
          hard. Looking good, we're thirty
          seconds away from taking this one
          home. Let's bring it in.

</b>          I'm sorry, Monix, but we don't even

          Deep down, I feel like it's really
          my Mom who is making love to her.
          When I hold Lucy's supple breasts
          in my hands, they are my Mom's

</b>          I don't know, are we ready?

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Yeah, let's do it.

<b>          BEAR HANDLER
</b>          You guys want to give me a safe
          word?

<b>          CLARENCE THE REF
</b>          What's a safe word?

<b>          BEAR HANDLER
</b>          It's a word for you to yell to the
          Ref, so he can stop the match.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          I don't need a safe word.

<b>          BEAR HANDLER
</b>          Tell you what, if you get injured
          or you really feel like you're in
          danger, yell, um, I don't know...
          Spumoni. Once I get a signal from
          the ref, I'll come in.

<b>          CLARENCE THE REF
</b>          What's Spumoni?

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          It's an Italian Gelato, sort of
          like Almond flavored ice cream.

<b>          CLARENCE THE REF
</b>          Is it good?

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          I don't know, I've never had it.

<b>          BEAR HANDLER
</b>          It's really good.
          (Jackie and Clarence nod)
          Okay, so Spumoni is the safe word
          then?

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          No, I don't need a safe word, okay?
          Let's just do this. One round.
          (nodding to the bell man)
          DING DING DING! The bell has rung. The crowd goes crazy.
          Clarence assumes his position as ref.
          Jackie walks slowly toward the bear, frightened.
          They bear scratches his belly, cute. Jackie immediately
          quits.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (re: The scratching)
          Okay, fuck this.

<b>          CLARENCE THE REF
</b>          What? You can't quit already.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          SPUMONI. I'm out of here.

<b>          CLARENCE THE REF
</b>          You can't SPUMONI, all he did was
          scratch his nuts.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Well, too bad, I'm SPUMONI-ING.
          PEOPLE START TO BOO. Jackie looks around at the angry crowd.

<b>          CLARENCE THE REF
</b>          You gotta give 'em a show. C'mon,
          the bear seems pretty tired, look
          at him.
          It's true, the bear is pretty docile. The bear's indifference
          gives Jackie a glimmer of confidence.

<b>          CLARENCE THE REF
</b>          Just test him out a little. Maybe
          it won't be so bad.
          Jackie nods, then hops around with his dukes in the air. Now
          he does a shuffle for the crowd. After dancing a bit, the
          bear is still motionless.

          As Jackie does a victory dance, the commissioner approaches.

<b>          COMMISH
</b>          Jackie.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Oh, hey Commish. Good game huh? And

<b>

</b>          I'm sorry, but even if you beat the
          Spurs on Friday, we just can't have
          an NBA franchise in Flint.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          What are you saying?

<b>          COMMISH
</b>          It's just not good business. Flint
          isn't a big enough media market,
          okay? This stadium is small and,
          frankly, it needs to be torn down
          before someone gets hurt. I'm sorry
          but nobody ever thought you guys
          could ever get this far.

<b>          CLARENCE
</b>          Well tough shit. This team did make
          it this far. Rules are rules.

<b>          COMMISH
</b>          Rules are rules... Until the
          expansion committee makes new
          rules. Then those rules are the
          rules.
          Everyone looks at each other. Jackie's brain has slipped into
          a deep trance. He is no longer inside his body.

<b>          COMMISH
</b>          Don't take this personally, Jackie.
          These other teams have strong
          markets, new stadiums. It's just
          not going to happen for you Flint
          boys. I'm sorry.
          The devastation of what is happening is palpable. Nothing has
          ever hurt this bad before.

</b>          I know you're going to punch me,
          Jackie. So let's just get it over
          with.
          The commissioner stands brave, eyes closed, chin out.
          Jackie is too confused and devastated to hit anything. He
          stumbles out of the room like a zombie. The team follows.
          The commissioner opens his eyes. A long silent beat...

          Jackie opens his mouth... He tries to speak, but he can't.

</b>          Tell me, if you didn't care about

          A wide shot of an alley. We hear a familiar voice off screen.

<b>          JACKIE MOON (O.S.)

          Baby, who wants to- love me sexy!

          I'm a big faker and I stole this;

          the garbage. Jackie ignores his teammate.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          I'm going to hang myself with an

          The entire team has gathered. Monix addresses them.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Listen up. We all know that
          Clarence has been traded. And we
          all know that this game doesn't
          matter anymore, right?

<b>          BEE BEE ELLIS
</b>          Right.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Well I've got news for you. This

          because this is the last real

          NBA or no NBA. Merger or no merger.
          We decided we are going to win

          Jackie is moved. The guys look at each other and nod.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          Over the past five weeks, we've
          become a team. And that is no small

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          No sir.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          It feels pretty good.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          All your lives, you've dreamed of
          playing in the NBA. Well, guess
          what? Tomorrow night, you are.
          You're playing an NBA team. And for
          one night, the world is going to
          know that you belong.

          to fourth or not.
          Monix turns inward, speaking with an emotion that is pure.

<b>          MONIX
</b>          But the truth is, I want this more
          than anything I've ever wanted in

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (with a gleam in his eye)
          We.'re going to win this game,

</b>          if the commissioner is listening, I

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          There were many wild protests in
          Flint this week. But it seems like
          the whole city is now focused on
          beating the San Antonio Spurs. This
          team seems to have captured every
          heart in this town of underdogs.
          People have poured in from around
          the state to support this drive
          toward their first mega-bowl
          championship.

          his head.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.O.)
</b>          The Flint Tropics will be playing
          without their number one scorer,
          Coffee Black tonight. The Spurs
          have signed several new players
          from around the ABA, locking them
          in before they hit the free market
          in next year's expansion draft. The
          .big man, Pete Petrelli has been
          sent over from the dismantled
          Anaheim Amigos.
          Now Petrelli enters frame. The guy we hate has been traded to
          the Spurs too.

<b>          PETRELLI
</b>          We may be teammates, but I still

          sitting center court. The TROPICAL AISLE cheers, rowdy. The
          BALL GIRLS look almost nervous. You can feel the excitement.
          And now entering, by herself, standing in the back, is LYNN.
          She takes a deep breath.

          It's immediately clear that the Tropics are being over
          powered.
          QUICK CUTS: PETRELLI knocks over Monix and scores.
          -The Tropics offense is getting shut down.
          -Jackie gets a rebound, but then dribbles off his ankle.
          -The fans are disappointed. The guys in the Tropical Aisle
          are all bummed out. Wheelchair Jody looks pissed.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          Not a good first half for the
          Tropics so far. They're already

          The coach stares him down, then picks another player.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          This is easily the worst half of
          basketball the Tropics have ever
          played. And that's saying

          The second half is underway. Clarence and Jackie are both
          playing for the Tropics.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          We're back in action here at the

          for the Tropics... And Jackie Moon
          makes the start... In fact, it
          looks like he's trying to run the
          offense here...
          Jackie dribbles at the top of the key, doing a lot of
          pointing along with multiple hand signals.

<b>          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
</b>          This is a new offense for the
          Tropics. Jackie dribbles to the top
          of the key... And...
          Jackie makes eye contact with Clarence.
          Clarence cuts to the basket and Jackie throws him a lob.
          SLO MO: As Clarence leaps, we hear Jackie's voice over from
          the locker room...

<b>          JACKIE (V.0.)
</b>          I had a dream. And in my dream, my
          mother jumped... Her gown flowing
          in the wind... And she caught a
          pass in the air and dunked it,
          without ever touching the ground...
          SLO MO: Clarence catches it and slams it hard.

<b>          JACKIE MOON (V.0.)
</b>          .She lifted her veil and said 'I
          call this the Alley Oop.'
          Everyone stands there, astonished. The other team is frozen.
          The fans are confused. The ref has no idea what to do.

</b>          It's not a foul unless you touch

          The NBA draft is crowded with businessmen and fans.

<b>          DRAFT ANNOUNCER

          Clarence stands up, happy, and walks on stage.
          He holds up a uniform with words: SHITBITCH U.B. PHYNE on it.
          REVEAL: In the crowd, Monix claps, cheering Clarence on... He
          is with wife, LYNN.
          But now Monix stands up and walks on stage too. He puts a NEW

<b>          INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
</b>
          Jackie is in a recording studio, playing the synthesizer.
          plays some beats, then hits the keyboards.

<b>          TITLE: JACKIE MOON WENT ON TO WRITE AND RECORD HIS OWN
</b>
<b>          ORIGINAL SONG.
</b>          We recognize Jackie's song as the most familiar song in the
          world. It's Gary Glitter's 'Rock N' Roll Part II' the most
          famous sports-stadium standard in history.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (singing Gary Glitter)

<b>          HEY!
</b>
<b>

</b>          (waiting for the beats)

<b>          HEY!
</b>          (waiting for the beats)

<b>          HEY!
</b>
<b>          TITLE: HIS SONG WOULD LATER BE STOLEN BY GARY GLITTER AND
</b>
<b>          PLAYED IN STADIUMS ACROSS THE GLOBE.
</b>
<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          (singing Gary Glitter)

<b>          HEY!
</b>          (waiting for the beats)

<b>          HEY!
</b>          (waiting for the beats)

<b>          HEY!
</b>          The song ends. The recording engineer pipes in.

<b>          RECORDING ENGINEER
</b>          Sounded pretty nice.

<b>          JACKIE MOON
</b>          Yeah, that was a great take. Play
          that back for me, would you?

<b>          RECORDING ENGINEER
</b>          Listen, can you take that ring off
          for a little while? I'm getting
          some feedback from your microphone.

<b>          ECU: JACKIE WEARS A HUMONGOUS FLINT MICHIGAN TROPICS FOURTH

</b>          Sorry Robert, the ring stays on.
