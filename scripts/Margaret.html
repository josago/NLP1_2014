          From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the
          curb. She steps off the curb toward us --
          A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened
          perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But
          the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to
          and fro through the frame.

          The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers
          step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first
          foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the
          mid-day work crowd crosses the street.

          An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School,
          one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive
          schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A
          sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids.
          The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.

          One after the other the students get up to collect their
          tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to
          their chairs.
          On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her
          class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly,
          somewhat bad-temperedly.

          to know this stuff in my daily life...

<b>                         MR AARON
</b>          Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily
          true. Haven't you ever developed an 
          interest in something you didn't initially
          think you were going to develop an interest
          in?

          Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa
          looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up.

</b>          Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big
          difference-between using a book and like, I
          don't know, using somebody else's mind
          who's like, really good at math? It's not
          like this person did the whole test for me.

          -- where kids are smoking. Lots of butts on the ground. The
          walls covered with graffiti. Lisa goes to her friend BECKY 
          and takes out her cigarettes. A kid named KURT smokes nearby.

          She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa
          watches them.

          Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to
          some other girls seated on the steps.

          private detectives to break the strike, and
          they went out there and shot them down!
          Just like they did in Virginia, just like

          big fan of all the Presidents of the United
          States, especially the current one, but I
          still don't think its necessarily all that
          useful to categorize every President as
          universally corrupt, because that just
          seems very general to me. Especially if
          you're going to judge them by the standard
          of -- whatever they're supposed to
          traditionally be like in some mythical
          version of America that probably never
          existed to begin with.

          software, so the computers can't talk to
          each other. It's a big problem in Central
          and South America, where there is not
          usually so much coordination in computer
          communications. So right now there's a big
          opportunity for us, because for the big
          software companies it's still in the
          backwoods. That's changing already, but in

          well. It's the next ten years we're going
          to see what happens.

          when you're traditionally supposed to freak
          out. So why don't you just not? You're not

</b>          No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it,
          because of my demographic. And the odds are
          you're probably not gonna have to have an
          abortion either. And since this was your
          first time, it might as well be a basically
          happy memory instead of a shitty one.

<b>                         EMILY
</b>          As you all know, Monica was not a religious
          woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through
          a wedding or a funeral with her knows how
          she felt about formal occasions. So Harry
          and Elise and I, when we were talking about
          this, decided we would just have everyone
          over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk.
          about Monica just talk about her. Maybe
          share some remembrances of her. Some of us
          know each other, some of us don't. But
          we're all here because we loved Monica.
          (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And 
          because we want to pay tribute to her in a
          way that might conceivably not enrage her.
          Everyone laughs slightly.

<b>                         EMILY (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't want to tell anyone what to think,
          or how to feel. And I don't want to kid
          myself about the stupid, meaningless way
          she died, because it would really make her
          throw up. But I don't want it to become the
          summation of her life. Because it's not.
          When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can
          you stand it?" And she said. "First of all
          I can't. But I don't want to take away the
          twelve years she did have, and turn them
          all into leukemia. Because they weren't."
          So despite the fact that she got -- ripped
          off, I do think it's important to remember
          that Monica got a lot out of life. She was
          the most fully developed person I
          personally have ever known. She was also
          impossible to get along with, but that's
          another story.
          Everybody laughs.

</b>          You know what, Lisa? That's not good
          enough. That's not good enough.
          Shakespeare wrote something: What's your
          response? And don't tell me you don't have
          one because I don't buy it.

          saying that human beings don't mean any

          boys who like to torture them for fun.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          (responding in kind)
          Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only
          it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's
          Gloucester. Maybe another character would
          have a different point of view.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          OK: That's a valid point. Just because
          Shakespeare has one of his characters say
          it doesn't mean he personally agrees with
          it. Yes: David?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the
          gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying
          there's a higher consciousness that we
          can't see. That the gods' perception of
          reality is so much more developed than ours
          that compared to their perception, our
          perceptions are like comparing flies to

<b>                         BOYS
</b>
<b>                         JOHN
</b>          OK...I don't think that's what he's getting
          at...I think what he's getting at here is a
          very dark view of the arbitrary nature of
          human suffering.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing
          human consciousness to divine
          consciousness, and he's saying that even
          though it seems to us that human suffering
          is just arbitrary, that's just because
          we're limited by our viewpoint. 

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test
          David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as
          flies to wanton boys. They kill us for
          their sport." I have to agree with Matthew,
          that seems pretty unambiguous.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher
          purpose that we can't see. He's saying that
          what seems like them killing us for sport
          could just be because our consciousness
          isn't developed enough to see what the
          higher wisdom of their killing us is.

<b>                         JOHN

          he's trying to say. Um...

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          No, like if you say they kill us for their
          sport, when our perception of the gods is
          so meager that we can't even tell what
          they're doing, then how can we be so
          arrogant as to think that they would bother
          to kill us for their sport?

<b>                         MONICA
</b>          I don't think that's what he's saying at
          all. I think he's saying the gods don't
          give a shit about human beings and they
          just kill and torture us for fun --

<b>                         MATTHEW
</b>          Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys.
          Anybody? Anybody?

<b>                         MONICA
</b>          Yeah...1

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          But if the gods' consciousness is so much
          more developed than ours that we seem like
          flies to them, then how can we be sure what
          they have in mind for us or why they do
          anything?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          David, I think you've made your point.
          But it's not what Shakespeare meant.
          Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that
          he's trying to say something about
          human suffering here --

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          Scholarly opinion...:

<b>                         JOHN

          pretty bleak --

          like to move on --

<b>                         DAVID
</b>          I think he is saying that, because he's
          comparing human consciousness to flies, and
          he's saying that we can't see the truth
          around us because our consciousness is
          undeveloped.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          No David, that's not what Shakespeare
          meant! He says it somewhere else in the
          play, but I don't want to get hung up on
          this any more because it's not what
          Shakespeare meant, and I would really like
           to move on.

          manslaughter? Or second degree murder?

</b>          No. He could be charged with reckless
          driving, and fillip' out a false police

</b>          Yes. Because that's the definition of
          murder. Killin' somebody on purpose.

</b>          When someone is killed it's what you call a
          Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory
          case, which just means there's a statute
          passed by the legislature which gives you
          the right to bring the case.

</b>          So good.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Yes. This is good. Because the executor of
          the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit,
          but the beneficiary has to be a relative.
          So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful
          Death suit you can sue for Pain and
          Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of
          Support or Services.. .And also what's

</b>          Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't
          have any money. You basically sue everybody
          and hope something sticks. The person who
          pays will be the MTA's insurance company.

          long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a
          half a million dollars to get a sustainable

          it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but
          he agrees with me we still don't have
          enough to charge this guy, so there's
          really not a lot more we can do at this

          whose families have been killed, or the
          parents have been kidnapped, so they don't
          know if they are alive or dead. We try to

          only so much we can do. You don't like to

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I know. You don't have to keep saying that.
          I've always wanted to travel. It's just a
          little difficult with two kids and no
          husband, but it's hard to make a lot of
          money in the theater. I was on a TV show a
          few years back and I socked away some money
          because of that, but my ex-husband --

</b>          Karl, yes, you remembered, very good.
          Karl's very generous with the kids when he
          can be, but he's struggling too: He's a
          director: he directs commercials, and now
          he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm
          not ignorant because I enjoy it.

          be the age.

</b>          Well, it's just nice, because you can work
          a long time in the theater and play really
          good parts without getting a lot of
          recognition. And even though you don't 
          necessarily do it for that as your primary
          motive, it is very nice when people do
          notice something you've done.

          and I had been doing theater all my life,
          and suddenly all my relatives started
          calling me up to congratulate me because
          they thought I finally Made It. And it was
          really just this dumb show that paid the
          bills for a while...

<b>                         LISA
</b>          That show was so stupid.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          It wasn't that bad...! Anyway: I realize
          this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa, but
          I really wanted to meet you, Emily, because
          you've frankly become such a big part of
          Lisa's life, and I don't want to be
          intrusive, but this whole court case seems
          to be suddenly dominating everything and I
          can't get Lisa to tell me anything about it

<b>                         LISA
</b>          That's not true...!

<b>                         JOAN

          Lisa, that I'm very, very proud of you for
          pursuing this the way you have.

          where it's taking over your life or
          interfering with your school work. (To
          EMILY) It's really come down to a question
          of homework. Lisa is on a half-scholarship
          at her school. And I know she feels a real 
          sense of responsibility about what happened

</b>          No. I didn't.

</b>
                          
          Yeah. I think she was confused... like, I

                          
          think she thought I was her daughter for a
          minute. And then she was asking me to call
          her, like to tell her what happened: You
          know, like she didn't remember she was
          dead.

<b>                         EMILY
</b>          What do you mean? What did she say?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          She just asked if somebody could call her
          daughter. But then it got confusing because
          I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she
          said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No,
          that's my name." Because it took me a
          minute -- I didn't realize we had the same
          name...
          Emily does not respond.

<b>                         LISA (CONT'D)

          was registering with her.

</b>          But then when I found out her daughter was
          dead, ever since then I keep having this
          really strong feeling that some way, for
          those last five minutes I kind of was her
          daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the
          reason I was there: Like in some weird way,
          this obviously amazing woman got to see her
          daughter again for a few minutes, right
          before she died.

          my body. I don't believe in all that stuff

          On the blackboard Klein finishes writing: SHOULD TEENAGERS

<b>          RULE THE WORLD? YES OR NO?
</b>
<b>                         KLEIN
</b>          OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your
          drum away.
          Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.

<b>                         KIRSTEN
</b>          I think that teenagers should definitely
          rule the world, because teenagers aren't
          corrupted by adult life yet, and they're
          idealists and they care. And I know a lot
          of people feel that teenagers are really
          naive, which they are, many of them. But
          they still haven't had a chance to get
          burned out by the disappointments and the
          harsh realities of learning how to play the
          game. So yes, I would vote yes.

<b>                         KLEIN
</b>          All right: Lisa?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          I would tend to agree with all of that,
          except I do think that teenagers don't
          always necessarily think things through
          very carefully, and they don't have enough
          experience to know what the right thing to
          do is all the time. I also think they tend
          to adhere to ideologies really easily
          without having actually bothered to think
          them through for themselves.--

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Or what about all these teenage suicide
          bombers? Not that I want to get into the
          whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming
          you don't think suicide bombing is a good
          thing, wouldn't you say that's an example
          of being idealistic without using your
          critical faculties?

</b>          Well, I don't know if this is good or bad,
          but speaking of ideology, it's interesting

          believe in to sacrifice their lives for it.

          they will not discuss disciplining of a

          carry the same stigma. On top of that you
          may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a
          very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right

</b>          I don't know.
          Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to
          the opera?

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Yes.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          I didn't-remind you because I didn't want
          to nag you.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          It's OK.

           Lisa starts to cross the street against the light. Joan takes
          her arm.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Don't get run over.
          A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is
          approaching.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          Wait. I want to see if that's him.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          What.
          They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them
          and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          It is him. Mom, that's the one...
          Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as
          people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see
          their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two
          dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at
          them and drives past with a short wave.
          Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain.

</b>
          Lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette, looking out
          over Lincoln Center. Joan comes out and stands next to her,
          but Lisa won't look at her or interact.

<b>                         JOAN
</b>          Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I
          ever heard.

<b>                         LISA
</b>          What do you mean? It's OK.
          The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in.
          Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.

           Lisa comes down the stairs and goes into -- 

<b>          173 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- ORCHESTRA. NIGHT. 173
</b>
           Lisa hurries down the long aisle. The LIGHTS DIM. The 
           audience applauds the entering conductor. She picks her way 
           past the other patrons in the row, whispering "Excuse me" and
           takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS. Joan looks at her. 
           Lisa stares straight ahead. 

           The curtain rises. On stage, the two women start singing the 
          barcarole "Belle Nuit." It's very beautiful.
          Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry,
          but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and
          wipes them away, but they keep coming.
          Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her.
          Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely,
          clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts
          crying too out of sympathy.

          As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa
          crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand
          and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that
          the spell has been broken.

          The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK.
