</b>
          The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the
          middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks;
          shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the
          screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED:

<b>                         "1:52"
</b>          Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual
          face is visible because of his thick white hair, large
          bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The
          rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He
          wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered
          package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing
           it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker --
          "Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears
          quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than
          he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs,
          CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign:

<b>          "SUBWAY."
</b>
<b>          INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY
</b>
          A level above the locals, two above the express trains.
          Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens.
          Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives
          his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes
          through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending
          stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice:

<b>          "IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN.."
</b>
<b>          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY
</b>
          Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a
          placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing
          the number "10", black on a white ground, indicating the
          point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the
          sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green
          turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the
          track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the
          far end of the platform.

<b>          SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV

          sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train
          roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with
          the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair
          of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now
          MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the
          still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing
          on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA).

           enters the station. We flash by the "rear-enders" (those
          I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we
          stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man
          (GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different
          from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals
          -- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses,
          slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc-

          Grey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding
          them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts
          with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes
          up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and
          placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He
          surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes.

<b>          INT. FIRST CAR

          Green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the
          motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between
          his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten
          and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm
          door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before
          them, playing.: at driving the train.

          bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch
