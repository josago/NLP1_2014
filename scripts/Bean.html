</b><b>INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARDROOM - DAY
</b>
A very grand room, with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the
walls.

A group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen. They are the trustees of the
National Gallery. LORD WALTON, a very grand man, sits at the table head. To
his right sits his assistant, GARETH. All are deep in thought. LORD WALTON
fidgets with a pencil on the table. He raises his head as though about to
speak. Everyone looks up expectantly. And... LORD WALTON goes back to
fidgeting. So does everyone else.

<b>EXT.   MR BEAN'S STREET.     DAY
</b>
Mr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world-

He walks up the street, tutting slightly at     a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes.
The street is totally car-free except for a     very visible lime green mini. A
policeman strolls by and glances down at a     pair of legs sticking out from
under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on,      satisfied that someone is mending
their car.

BEAN approaches the car     and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then
unlocks the big padlock     that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside,
fiddles with something     else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening
speed with a smug look     on his face.

The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits.

BEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if
it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound
fault.

BEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a
lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps
violently.

BEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the
problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player
strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune.

On he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious
familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful
traffic.

Heels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He
takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight-
line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S
<b>
</b>satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a
perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls.

But at the end of      the alley, the traffic's just as bad.     BEAN    notices he's
outside Harrods.       There's a tail-coated Security Guard at    the    'front door.
BEAN watches him      stroll a bit down the street - and takes    his    chance. He
turns and drives      straight through the double doors, into    the    store.

</b>

<b>INT.    HARRODS.   DAY.
</b>
BEAN and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and
leather glove racks.

CUT TO a Security Guard. As       he passes one of the counters, BEAN's little car
just shoots behind him. The       Guard continues through the Children's section
there are giant elephants and      teddies, children's size cars, then two huge
plastic tractors - and then,      stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the
Lime Green Mini with BEAN in      it. The Guard walks straight past.

The moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard
and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme
song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps.

6 people waiting at a gilded lift. They hear a strange sound, and turn to see
what it is. In fact, it's coming from inside the lift. When the lift doors
open, out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the street.

<b>                                                                                        3

<b>EXT.    KNIGHTSBRIDGE.     DAY.
</b>
Out in the street, BEAN is faced by an accident. There are flashing lights, a
crumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers. BEAN looks concerned.

<b>                                                                                 CUT TO:
</b><b>EXT.    THE STRAND.     DAY.
</b>
An Ambulance roars through the traffic. It reaches its hospital, turns off,
and there, right smack behind it is the Mini. Cut in to see BEAN, smiling
broadly. He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending
pigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque
National Gallery. Of course, there's not another car there. Just the Gallery
and the mini.

<b>                                                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.    NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY
</b>
BEAN    gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and
takes    out a "Doctor on Call' sign. To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the
back    window and a skull of the front seat. Happy with the arrangement, he re-
locks    the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work.

As he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that
Board meeting was taking place.

A glimmer of hope.



<b>INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    PORTRAIT SECTION - DAY
</b>
BEAN wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in them.
He passes a guard.

<b>                                        GUARD
</b>                           (not looking up from his book)
                     Morning, Bean.

The GUARD sighs with boredom. He gets this from BEAN every day. As Bean
moves on, he treads on the heel of a tourist's shoe. It comes off- BEAN moves
on blithely.

<b>                                                                       CUT TO:

<b>INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CARTOON ROOM ENTRANCE - DAY
</b>
BEAN is passing the very special room where Leonardo Da Vinci's cartoon, 'The
Virgin and Child', hangs, preserved by a very dim artificial light. There are
silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work,
listening to a female GALLERY GUIDE.

BEAN dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a
coin. The coin drops and rolls into the special room. BEAN follows it into
the darkness.

<b>                                   GALLERY GUIDE

                   ... by Leonardo Da Vinci. As you can see, the special light
                   in here goes some way to protect the drawing from
                   photodisintegration caused by gamma ...

The camera stays outside the room with the picture in view. We hear the
squeak of a tiny door open, then a click. The room is suddenly flooded in
blazing white light. The onlookers gasp in horror.

<b>                                                                               5
</b>
BEAN re-emerges from the room with his precious coin. As an afterthought he
pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light. He scuttles away.
The GALLERY GUIDE shakes her head in total exasperation.
<b>                                                                      CUT TO:

They all raise their hands wildly.

</b><b>INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
BEAN stands in the elevator silently with four other       people. He gives himself
a long squirt of breathfreshener. Then offers it to        the others, who politely
refuse him. So he stands still again. Pause. BEAN          then smells something
unpleasant. He leans and has a little sniff of the        person to his left. All
right there. Then he sniffs to his right, and reels        at what he smells. He
again takes out the breath freshener, and forces it       upon VINCENT, an elderly
gentleman, who is mortified.

At this moment the elevator stops - BEAN and VINCENT get out and the camera
follows VINCENT as he heads for the boardroom door and enters. He is another
trustee. This dialogue is heard from behind the closed door.

<b>                                    VINCENT

</b><b>INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
BEAN, with cup of tea, walks along a corridor. He can't not interfere for
tidiness sake. One empty room he switches off the light. Another he shuts
the door.

He passes a computer room, with an open door where a big man is busily typing
in a programme - BEAN looks at him snootily and heads on.

He approaches the door to his office. A sign reads: 'STORAGE & CATALOGUE'.
There is a huge padlock on the door. BEAN takes out a big key and enters his
domain.

<b>                                                                           CUT TO:

<b>INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    STORAGE OFFICE - DAY.
</b>
BEAN enters. He's been here for years and made it his own. It's an odd
little world. There's a framed picture of Shirley Bassey on his desk and
Airfix planes hang from the ceiling. Also a large cosy armchair and a T.V.

A pleasant Man in a suit, around 40, breezes in.

<b>                                    SUIT MAN
</b>             Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht.    Still Life.
             Circa 1670. Can do?

BEAN nods. This is what BEAN likes to do best. The camera follows as he
turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him...

His office is just a tiny    corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet
high and long, the walls    completely full of rack after rack of stored
paintings. At the end of     the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts,
modern abstracts, men on    horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot. It's
like the giant storehouse    at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.

<b>                                                                                7
</b>
BEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way. He knows exactly where heels
going. He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself
off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners.

He has now reached the sculpture area, but    the painting heels looking for is
on the other side. He crosses the room by     using the sculptures as a kind of
artistic obstacle course. In front of him     is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin
statue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply     walks across their 5 heads, like
stones in a stream.

He then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as    a slide   and at the
end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern    thing.    He then
begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the    mouths   as
footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty    eyes as   finger
holes.

After a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he
walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic
sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to
the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse,
three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall.
<b>
</b>He then triumphantly pulls out a painting.     It's the one!,

</b>              What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art
              stored in that one, curious brain of yours.

              one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly
              modest collection - but it does include the most famous American
              painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts?

Cut to the trustees - they shake their heads and wrinkle, their noses, not
very interested. A 106 year old SIR RUPERT puts up his hand.

BEAN gives a little pleasured squeak.             How exciting for him.   He follows MISS
HUTCHINSON out into the corridor.

BEAN    walks along    the same corridor as before. Turns off another light. Then
comes    to the room    where he saw the Programmer. The computer, showing a Van
Gogh    portrait, is    on and no-one's there. BEAN, who hates wasted electricity,
goes    in to switch    it off.

We see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the Storage room -
with an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located. BEAN is clearly
going to be replaced by this programme. Or not ... BEAN searches for the
plug, but it's under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of the
back the computer. The entire system clicks off. At which moment the
Programmer comes back in.

With a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement
at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. And
a disastrous one. There is a ugly electrical fizzle. The screens come on
white, then pop out completely.

BEAN realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable
into another circuit. The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen. BEAN and
PROGRAMMER both give out a sigh of relief. BEAN smiles and leaves quickly.
But a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh slides
down the screen like a water-colour in the rain. The PROG difficult to
breathe.

There is a knock at the door. BEAN enters. LORD WALTON smiles. The rest of

nervous indeed.

The phone rings. LORD WALTON answers. BEAN sits next to VINCENT and sniffs
at him. VINCENT's breath hasn't improved.

He slowly hangs up. Everyone has got the gist of what has just occurred with
the new computer- The energy drains from them all as they contemplate another

</b>
BEAN rounds a corner and walks     towards us, imitating a bowlegged cowboy. The
Theme from Bonanza plays. He      whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters,
spins them on his fingers and     returns them to-their imaginary holsters, making
gun sound effects. He's very      happy.-He passes the Security Guard - he draws
his gun on him - zero reaction     the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns.

BEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is
<b>
</b>broken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The
Ultra-Human Form. This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads in to
the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are
having a good giggle.

BEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting
they're inspecting.

Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has
breasts. BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand.

Now the third girl    heads on, so BEAN can drop the hand on the first painting -
but now has to try    to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real
long stretch away.     He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which
gives him the extra    3 inches. Again, safe. Just.

Now, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to BEAN's chagrin, head over
to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room. It's like the 3
Graces, 3 naked women back to back. BEAN thinks fast. He quickly whips off
his

Belt and rushes over to the statue, where he succeeds in looping it round to
cover all six nipples.

Unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other
side of the gallery. To BEAN's horror. Because at that moment we reveal what
is on the other side of the room. A epic painting in the style of the others
- with literally 40 graphically naked people.

BEAN sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to
cover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood.

At which    moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls appear and
scream in    chorus. BEAN thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence
and is in    outraged agreement with them. He turns. Cut wide to reveal that
they are    screaming because he's beltless
trousers    have fallen down.

8.30 am California time. A modern building with plenty of glass. Large,
modern sculptures are spotted around its grounds, including a dramatic one of
two huge old cars, head down in the ground, backs protruding into the air.

THOMAS GRIERSON, owner of the gallery, wearing a slick expensive suit, walks
with DAVE LEARY and BERNIE, both in casual jackets and ties. GRIERSON is a
vain, slightly pedantic and pompous man - maybe short - always just trying to
show he's Boss. The three are strolling towards the main entrance. Huge
sign: 'THE GRIERSON GALLERY' with a silhouette of Whistler's Mother taken from
the painting, as an incorporated logo.

but slightly worried man, knocking on 40. Too nice for his own good. The
three pass a lone MIME ARTIST wearing a cheap vac-form PRESIDENT CLINTON face

behind. He scampers to catch up.

Four other chairs - and finally the deep freeze.        No-one's going to get in
through that door.

BACK IN THE    HALL BEAN pushes the string    back inside the    letter box and slaps
his hand in    satisfaction. He locks the     door's enormous    padlock, looks about
carefully to    make sure no one's around,    and then hides    the key under a garden
gnome on the    floor, standing amongst a    row of pathetic    pot plants.

The lady checking in BEAN looks puzzled as she holds his passport. So he
pulls the shockingly stupid face. 0h yes, she sees, that's the guy in the

 BEAN enters the first class lounge. It's fairly empty, but BEAN still
 squeezes himself between an old lady drinking a cup of tea, and a very grand
 looking American military man in a business suit.

 The Grand Man lights up a cigar. This doesn't please Mr "No Smoking BEAN.
 First, he waves the smoke away, in small, then big, then huge wafting
 motions. Then he tries, miming, to cut it up into segments and move them
 aside. The man pays no attention at all.

 BEAN puts a plastic mug over his face, like a gas mask and breathes heavily.
 The man looks at him - but doesn't give a damn

 BEAN now takes a paper bag - catches some of the smoke, and take it over and
 empties it into the dust bin.

 The Grand Man goes on smoking stubbornly.        He then sees a magazine rack and
 leaves his cigar as he goes to get one.

 He can't quite hide his tackiness.) DAVID holds the door for GRIERSON - then
 sees an old woman coming towards him. He waits for her to go through, and
 due to his sweetness, is again left behind. He rushes to catch up.

They are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop. DAVID exchanges
smiles with the cashier, ANNIE. Very bubbly, not very bright. The shop is
full of Whistler's Mother memorabilia - posters, cards, porcelain statuettes.

</b> 7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into
 the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing
 BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a
 bum-fluff moustache.

 DAVID gets out of his car and approaches them.

            Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some
            more.

 The two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the
 house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON,
 has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are
 laughing in the car as DAVID walks up.

getting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID.

Alison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better -
she's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams
out. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed
her and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out.

<b>EXT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - NIGHT
</b>
9.30 p.m. U.K. time. A black London taxi is parked outside a terraced house
with its motor idling. Its driver looks fed up waiting. BEAN appears at a
downstairs window, motioning to his watch that he will not be long.

<b>                                                                           CUT TO:

<b>INT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - DAY
</b>
MR. BEAN is ready to leave his room.       Battered old
<b>
</b>suitcase in hand, he checks the room from the doorway.

Every conceivable thing that can be opened - cupboards,

drawers, fridge -sports an oversized padlock.    Even

Bean's old G.P.O. phone has one on its dial.

BEAN looks across to his TEDDY, who is lounging on a miniature chair, inside
an up-sided cardboard box. The box is sits on an armchair. A hand-written
sign, taped to its roof reads: 'TEDDY HOTEL' followed by three stars.
<b>                                                                            19
</b>
A smaller sign informs us that the hotel is: 'FULL'. BEAN is just about to
leave but stops to consider. Taking a felt tipped pen, he adds two more stars
on the hotel hoarding, as a treat.

He then, slightly, incomprehensibly, begins to tie string it around various
objects in the flat. The fridge - the corner of a chair, a couch leg.

BEAN leaves his flat. lee notice a large official sign stuck on the door
saying 'NO SMOKING". He now turns his attention to the pieces of string
hanging out the letter box in his door. Grabbing the bunch of them, he pulls.

CUT TO back inside the flat. we now understand the string - as all the
furniture starts to move across the flat. It works incredibly neatly the
chair reaches the door

BEAN acts fast.    He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the old woman's
cup of tea.

He sits there, guiltlessly, as the Grand Man returns. Simultaneously, the man
tries to suck the wet cigar, and the Old woman drinks the disgusting tea. A
horrid experience for both.

</b>

<b>INT.   AEROPLANE - DAY.
</b>
Boarding time. BEAN enters the plane and turns    right, into the body of the
plane. After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back
up to first. As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from
totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the
elegance, and space of First class.

BEAN couldn't be more thrilled.    There follows a sequence of short moments
from this nightmare flight.

1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage.    A hostess
slides it into the compartment above her head.

<b>                                      OLD LADY
</b>               Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter.
<b>
</b>The next instant BEAN comes up with his case. He opens the     same locker, and
tries to fit his case in. Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently. We
hear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there     - BEAN slams the
locker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash.      The OLD LADY looks
at BEAN suspiciously.

2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man,
whose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual.

Champagne comes    round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of
nuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress
him by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well
practised art).     No response.

BEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down
again. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face -
straight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless.

<b>                                                                                 21
</b>
Then 'BEAN has an idea. He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his
mouth, chews it into a spitball

And rams it into the blower. Both of them are relieved. REYNOLDS picks up
his champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under
high pressure, shoots

into it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS.     Not a good start.


3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He
looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the
aisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then
suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he
carries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose
simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better.

4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of
light. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading.

But even he is   wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards
sleep. Next to    him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and
unfortunately,   as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact
with REYNOLDS'   flies.

From across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked,
comes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly
strangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair
back - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON....

5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him.
Completely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open.         He
sees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess.

6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide
awake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son
isn't very well.

BEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel
more ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of
paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them.
<b>
</b>He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of
throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill
to be impressed.

BEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy
and then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea.
He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them.

<b>                                                                                22
</b>
He then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake REYNOLDS, when
he sees it's got a hole in it. No fun.

Meanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes,
that's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless
bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the
bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms
length, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment.

BEAN, is off the plane. REYNOLDS strides ahead of him, a huge wet patch in a
semi-circle around his neck. BEAN comes to a moving walkways. He steps on to
it sheepishly, thinking it's very daring and brave, gripping the handrail as
though he was travelling at 100 mph.

But soon he gains greater confidence. He stands up straight, both hands off
the rail. There are a couple of COPS leaning against a wall, chatting. BEAN
notices their guns. Slipping into role-play mode, he reaches into his breast
pocket, ready to bring out his imaginary shooter ... The last security guard
he tried this with just yawned ~ so BEAN thinks it's safe. But this time, the
COPS turn and stare at him tensely..

Flustered by their interest in him, BEAN needs to get away. He turns,        but
finds that he is walking in the opposite direction, on the spot. The        COPS
read this as suspicious behaviour and move towards him suspiciously.        BEAN
turns to gets himself going in the right direction. The COPS follow.         BEAN
runs. The COPS give chase.

The taxi draws up outside the house.      BEAN gets out with his case.   The CAB
DRIVER is strangely friendly.

<b>                                   CAB DRIVER
</b>             Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya.
             In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya,
             with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener,
             ya know that?

BEAN smiles politely. Taxi drives away. BEAN walks up to' the front porch,
checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell. No
answer. Presses again. Still no answer ... Now where have they hidden the
key. He inspects things carefully.

The camera sees what he sees ... the     doormat, the flowerpot, the window-ledge
... and then he spots a little stone     frog. BEAN smiles. Key hiding is
something he knows about - and people     are pathetically obvious about it. BEAN
picks up the FROG to reveal the front     door key. It glints in the porch-light.

BEAN lets himself in. The pre-alarm buzzer goes off quietly. He has 15
seconds before the alarm goes off proper. He strolls confidently to where the
alarm control unit obviously is ... under the stairs.

Close-up of flashing L.E.D. Again, BEAN looks carefully and finds the magnetic
box, housing a little key, attached to the underside of the console. Just as
the alarm goes off, for the splittest of a secondette, he turns the key in its
slot ... and is safe.

</b>BEAN finds the switch and turns on the hall light. He switches it off again
... then on. Then rapidly clicks it on and off repeatedly.Fun.

of the car and approach the house. DAVID brings out his door key.

disappears into a bedroom with a little ceramic sign on it saying: 'GUEST

The exhausted family enter an apparently untouched house. KEVIN turns on the

At that instant BEAN walks out, looking for the bathroom with his wash bag.
He looks up at the light. It should not be on. He frowns, turns it off and
exits to bathroom. At which precise moment JENNIFER, zombie-like, is halfway
up the stairs

JENNIFER goes into her room.     The sign reads: `JENNIFER'.

ALISON turns on the light and climbs the stairs. David heads into the
kitchen. They exchange a sad look. She goes into their bedroom: the sign
reads: 'GRUPS'. At which instant, BEAN, still wearing headphones, leaves the
bathroom, and heads downstairs ....

The light is on. DAVID takes a deep breath. Bad night. He picks up an empty
coffee jar, sighs and goes into the pantry a full one. BEAN enters. He opens
the refrigerator and he studies the food on offer. Nothing he fancies ...
then BINGO!

He sees a little plate of 3 strawberries. He eats     one, then two, then pops
the third into his mouth. It tastes a bit off, so     he takes it out of his
mouth, puts it back on the plate, closes the fridge    door, and exits ... just
as DAVID comes out of the pantry. Close on BEAN's     hand as it comes round the
door frame and turns off the light. DAVID, on the     move, stubs his toe on a

sucked strawberry and pops it into his mouth.

BEAN can't hear the T.V. because of his headphones. He takes out his
toothbrush but notices an electric one on a shelf with spare brush heads.
He's intrigue. He swaps the heads and enjoys cleaning his teeth with this
clever modern implement.

-He puts the   electric brush down and checks his teeth    in the mirror. He has
forgotten to   turn off the brush and so it vibrates off    the sink and lands in
the toilet.    Bean fishes it out and places it back on    the shelf where he found
it. He turns    off faucet, then exits, turning out the    light.

DAVID enters and turns the light on again. He takes down the toothbrush and
cleans his teeth. He calls through the bedroom door.

 The ancient G.P.O. phone starts to ring on a small table. (The following
 takes place in a matter of seconds).

 On the table are two, large, shiny, hard backed books, wedged up    at one end
 and sloping away at right angles to one another. Each book has a     pair of
 rulers set, parallel to one another, in Play-Doh. They each form     a canal.
 Between one pair of rulers sits a small box of salt. Between the    other pair
 is a miniature bust of BEETHOVEN. As the phone continues to ring     and
 vibrate the table, these items judder along the canal, an inch at    a time.

 The box of salt teaches the bottom of the book and topples over the edge of
 the table. ( The BEETHOVEN bust' teeters on the edge of its book). The salt
 lands in a plastic funnel, taped to the top of a bamboo stick. The bottom
 of the stick sits on the BBC 2 button of a T.V. remote control. Close-up of

 at a reasonable speed.

 BEAN suddenly yanks on the hand-brake. DAVID's head hits the windshield
 with a sickening thud. BEAN reaches for and fastens his seat belt. He
 looks to DAVID. DAVID gives BEAN a pained look. What planet does he come
 from? He fastens his own seat belt while BEAN wonders why it's all taking
 so long.

BEAN and DAVID arrive In the ground floor gallery. A few visitors are viewing

            worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep
            aesthetic level.


Stay with the ladies as DAVID and BEAN head on.

            gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom
            would be nice in this yellow ....

And-they head on to a Van Gogh with a nice yellow in it.

BEAN stops to admire a painting. It is Pre-Raphaelite in style, depicting a
woman reclined on a bed in a castle chamber. She is wearing a chastity belt
fastened with a small padlock, her breasts are concealed under a draped flag.

</b>It is a tasteful and romantic picture.

BEAN shakes his head. It's the padlock he's interested in he points at it and
smiles. ANNIE walks up.

He gestures that held like to tidy up a little. Brush his hair, etc. BEAN

BEAN stops dead in front of her - then turns sharp left into the men's
washroom. ANNIE's smile fades.

<b>INT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   WASH ROOM - DAY
</b>
BEAN    comes out of a booth. He tidies his hair and tie in a mirror. He pushes
down    the pressurised tap to wash his hands. It splashes terribly. The whole
front    of his trousers are soaked. The last thing you want when about to meet
your    new boss. Damn!

There now follow a quick, complicated piece of business.

1/ BEAN spots a paper-towel dispenser. He turns towards it at just the moment
a man exits from a booth - BEAN turns back to the sink to hide his trousers,
as the man swiftly does his hands, goes to the paper dispenser, and takes the
last towel. Damn again.
<b>
</b>2/ BEAN    now puts    his hope in a rolling    towel. But it's rather high. He has
to jump    to try to    reach the trouser.     At which point Another Man enters.
Jumping    BEAN has    been caught in a very    weird position. He pretends he has
.chosen    the Men's    Room as the place to    do his rather energetic exercise
routine.

3/ As the man leaves, he then tries to blow the patch dry with his mouth.
Another Man enters. Again, BEAN is 1 compromised - pretends it's even more
exercises. That man also enters a booth.

4/ BEAN suddenly notices the hand drying machine! He turns it on. A healthy
blast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping
and bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work.
Brainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly
the right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's
working excellently.

5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the
mirror. BEAN is in an immensely compromising          sex-with-machine position. He
pretends he's there to change the light bulb         above, which he takes out calmly
and polishes. The man leaves, BEAN smiles.           But as he exits, BEAN's face
transforms - he's totally scalded his fingers         on the scorching bulb.

6/ BEAN rushes to the sink, puts his fingers under the tap, pushes on the
water - and soaks himself all over again. At which moment, DAVID enters,
exasperated.

<b>                                          DAVID
</b>                Come on!     Let's go!

 BEAN exits uneasily hunched to hide his wet patch.          They enter the corridor,
 and he spots a newspaper.

<b> INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

 BEAN and DAVID enter. It's        a warm, formal. office. On the wall behind the
 desk is a full-size, framed       poster of Whistler's Mother. On a white
 background, at the base of       the poster, a caption reads: 'THE GRIERSON
 GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S       MOTHER'. Elsewhere, the walls are full of
 paintings.

 GRIERSON and BERNIE look up from a computer screen at DAVID and BEAN, who
 is, rather weirdly, carrying a newspaper in fronts of his flies. GRIERSON
 approaches David, and shakes his hand.

<b>                                      GRIERSON
</b>               Ah, David. Finally. (CHECKS HIS WATCH DELIBERATELY ) And this

</b>             This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the Doctor.

 BERNIE offers his hand. BEAN has to do a nifty handchange to free up the
 correct hand for the handshake. The newspaper stays firmly in place.

<b>                                THOMAS GRIERSON
</b>             Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just ....

He reaches out to borrow the newspaper. BEAN has to squeeze in right next to
the desk and sit behind it, before he can hand the paper over   thus ensuring
the continued invisibility of the wet patch. GRIERSON studies the paper for a
second.

<b>                                    GRIERSON
</b>             Take a seat, gentlemen..... although before we settle - feast your
             eyes on these.

GRIERSON goes to a painting on a wall. DAVID and BEAN follow ~ BEAN about one
inch from DAVID's back, walking in perfect rhythm.

<b>                                    GRIERSON
</b>             Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got four of them. Check
             this out ... Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables. Isn't that
             something?

He heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall - and BEAN and DAVID
follow, still totally glued together. A strange sight.

<b>                                       DAVID.

</b>             Maybe. Hell of a price, I'11 tell you.     Anyway - down to
             business.

 They head back to the desk - but Bean, in a momentary lapse of concentration
 fails to follow. He's now stuck on the wrong side of the room, unable to
 turn around.

<b>                                    GRIERSON
</b>             Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery

</b>             Ahm ... NO.

GRIERSON is slightly surprised.   But they persevere.

</b>             What I'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,'
             interactive public guide to the gallery.

Punching buttons on the computer, he reveals wonderful maps of the gallery,
and when clicking on sections of the map, graphic explanations of each rooms
contents.

Meanwhile.   Bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room.    He moves
<b>
</b>around the room, always facing straight to the wall. When he reaches the fan,
he switches it on: unfortunately it's a rotating fan - so to keep the wind on
his trousers, BEAN has to do a strange, rhythmic dancing movement, following
the arc of the fan.

<b>                                       DAVID
</b>           It's very good Bernie.

<b>                                   BERNIE
</b>           But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work
           oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the
           program to every room in the gallery.

</b>             Not bad, eh?    What do you think, Doctor?   Ah.... Doctor Bean?

 BEAN turns, shocked to    have been observed. He looks down at his trousers
 and, HOORAY!, they're    dry at last. He's delighted, and moves back across
 the road towards them,    hands in pockets, in a big, confident, groin-
 thrusting, dry-trouser    boasting walk.

<b>                                   GRIERSON

 BEAN displays his crotch proudly one last time before he and BERNIE exit.
 GRIERSON tries to fathom the strange man who just left.

</b><b>EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BY PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
(About 5 p.m.) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot. On the way, BEAN's
interest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton mask,
performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture. BEAN lingers.

The MIME accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb
her hair etc. The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really. The woman
quickly moves on.

BEAN is intrigued. The MIME mimes climbing a ladder. BEAN goes up next to
him - and looks up. There's nothing there. He decides the MIME is a bit of
a tricky. This is confirmed when the MIME pretends he's locked behind a
pane of glass. BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass
wall, and hits the MIME's nose.

                                 CUT TO: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off.

The MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last.    He
<b>
</b> takes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand
 the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the
 slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from
 where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves
 off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a
 mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed.

 The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns ....

 But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece
 of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold
 Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a
 hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens
 another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it.

 The MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool
 to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN
 twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the
 terrified MIME.

<b>                                                                             45
</b>
 Finally, in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat, he
 fires. 10 seconds delay, and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death, 50
 yards away.

BEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID, arms folded,
leans against his car. DAVID gets into his car. BEAN opens the passenger
door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same
as this morning).

<b>                                                                       CUT TO:

<b>EXT.   SHOPPING MALL.   PARKING LOT - DAY

DAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible.

<b>                                      DAVID
</b>
             Okay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak ... Wine - good.
             Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right,
             Bean, or ... (looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble, okay?

BEAN nods.   DAVID gets out and heads for the mall.   Nearby woman tramp (BAG
LADY) goes   through a trash can.

BEAN tries to control himself but weakens. He plays with all the buttons and
switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. Then he notices a
throbbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate.

BEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its
engine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of
someone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several
people returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to
them as if to say: "Are these yours?"

[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.]

Then suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall,
weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly
full of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight,
<b>
</b>a PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask.      As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old
friend, the MIME.

ROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets
in - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his
pockets ...

<b>                                                                                  46

BEAN leans into shot.     He holds out the keys, grinning.

<b>                                       ROBBER
</b>             Gimme the keys!

BEAN runs away with them. Or doesn't! He is in mime mode - And runs on the
spot, getting faster and faster. The ROBBER approaches this obvious madman.
He is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual.

<b>                                     ROBBER
</b>             I said, give me the keys!

BEAN turns and holds out two hands, just like the MIME did to him. The
perplexed ROBBER picks one hand. Wrong one. He then.... pulls a gun and puts
it hard to MR BEAN in BEAN's face. Passers-by scream and fall to the ground,
the bag lady amongst them. Sudden harsh reality.

But not to BEAN. He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the ROBBER's face,
ticking him off for breaking the rules.

<b>                                     ROBBER
</b><b>             OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!!
</b>
BEAN gestures the ROBBER to turn around. He does, sure this sicko is going
simply to shoot him in the head. But instead BEAN puts his back to the
ROBBER's back, and starts to count

<b>                                        BEAN
</b><b>              1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10

He turns and gestures to the ROBBER it's time to draw.       By this time a crowd
has gathered.

<b>                                     ROBBER

He points out a small child, watching from behind a trash can.

ALISON laughs at something that CHARLES says. Their body language suggests a
certain closeness. DAVID is saddened. He hurries away.

BEAN waves the gun at the ROBBER.

<b>                                       ROBBER
</b>             I haven't got a gun.

But BEAN is pushing him to draw.      Finally...

<b>                                      ROBBER
</b>                             Okay, okay, I'11 do it!

He draws. BEAN draws too. They fire. And BEAN really fires. To his
amazement. Onlookers scream. BEAN throws the gun away in startlement.

The ROBBER lunges for it ~ BEAN kicks it away, trying to help him avoid such a
dangerous implement.

The ROBBER lunges at BEAN who throws the keys away over his shoulder. The
ROBBER has to scrabble under a car for them- BEAN thinks of final joke - and
niftly swaps the ROBBER's bag, for one of the Old BAG LADY's bags. A few
dollar notes spill out of it.

When the ROBBER emerges with the keys, BEAN 's waiting to escort him to his
car. He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around
the ROBBER and gets him to take a photograph of them. BEAN removes the
ROBBER's mask as the picture is taken. Forgetting himself, the ROBBER smiles
for the camera.

The ROBBER, jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police car
sirens, jumps in the car and drives away. BEAN waves goodbye to the
convertible as a couple of Police cars screech up. COPS jump out.

DAVID approaches the scene with groceries and roses. What kind of hell has
BEAN caused now? But instead of trouble, he sees the passers-by are getting
to their feet, applauding BEAN and whistling! They crowd round the COPS
explaining what a hero BEAN has been.

BEAN hands over the gun to a COP. He doesn't really understand what all the
fuss is about. He notices the BAG

of them for the ROBBER'S? No. He's getting too much attention to be bothered.
A COP comes up to BEAN. It is COP 1 from the airport scene.

</b>Classic smoked filled room with street light cutting through half closed
Venetian blinds. Two or three DETECTIVES slouched in the shadows.

BRUTUS, the   huge    black detective from    earlier, sits opposite BEAN    at a table,
smoking. He    is    looking at a photo. A     close-up reveals it to be a    full length
one of BEAN   and    the ROBBER outside the    mall with the ROBBER's face    unmasked.
BRUTUS eyes   BEAN    for a while. BEAN is     terrified. BRUTUS taps the     photo.

<b>                                         BRUTUS
</b>              It's Eddie Guardino.     Go pick him up.

One of the DETECTIVES lazily leaves the room.          BRUTUS leans forward on his
elbows.

<b>                                      BRUTUS

              pantyhose. (drags on his cigarette) Anything you wanna tell me?

BEAN looks at h4-m blankly.       BRUTUS holds up the photo.

BEAN calmly takes the picture and tears it in half. He gives back the ROBBER
half and puts the other half, with himself on, into his pocket. BRUTUS glares
at him.

BEAN grins.    At last.     A question he can answer.     He nods, happily.

KEVIN is playing an adventure game: `GOBLINS 2' [This game exists.] The
GOBLINS chuckle and make stupid noises that BEAN can imitate. A catchy piece
of music accompanies the game.

The computer monitor shows the inside of the WIZARD's house. KEVIN moves the
GOBLINS, and two little characters, FINGUS and WINKLE, around the room by
clicking on areas in the room with his mouse.

BEAN and KEVIN are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper.

             I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2.

 BEAN is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little GOBLINS.
 He gets his delighted face right up to the screen. He sings along with the
 catchy tune. KEVIN is getting frustrated.

</b>             Come on, winkle.

 KEVIN clicks on a cuckoo clock in the WIZARD's room.       The cuckoo pops out
 holding a key in its beak.

</b>              It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the
              stupid cuckoo.

 BEAN scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the
 scene. His eyes light up. He takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly
 clicks on the frog.

 The frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone.       KEVIN gets excited.

 BEAN grins and makes WINKLE pick up the stone. Then he clicks through to
 inside the wizard's house. He makes WINKLE throw the stone at the cuckoo
 which instantly drops the key from its beak.

BEAN appears again behind her, now looking even madder. Pointy hat, large
pointy ears made from melon peel, held in place by the rubber band stretched
round his face ~ huge front teeth also cut from the melon. He grins
gleefully.

DAVID and ALISON just stare. BEAN is followed by KEVIN who wears the same ears

up a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room.

Too late! BEAN punches a button and the lid of the CD
player launches the Bambi into the air.

DAVID sees it. In slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it.         It
smashes on the floor.

BEAN raises his eyes heavenwards, shakes his head and tuts.        He thinks DAVID
is a real Butter Fingers.

JENNIFER, upset, has found the TV remote and unintentionally switches from the
Vampire game to a TV channel. It's very loud.

ALISON gives DAVID a tearful look, and shakes her head.

 hanging from strings across the room. BEAN is sticking things in a picture
 album.

 BEAN gives him an affable smile. In a pause before he quite gathers himself
 to broach the difficult subject, DAVID asks a polite question.

<b>                                        DAVID
</b>             May I?

 BEAN acquiesces. He starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a
 kid. Always standing on his own.

 Picture of BEAN with mop of frizzy hair, at 16.    DAVID smiles.   BEAN mimes
 stupid disco dancing.
<b>
</b> DAVID turns another page. It is a sequence      of pictures of BEAN at famous UK
 locations - Big Ben, Stonehenge, Buckingham     Palace, 10 Downing Street. They
 are .idiosyncratic because all taken by him     at arms length with his Polaroid
 - so he never quite makes it squarely into     shot.

 A whole page of Teddy. Then three pages of BEAN's mini with dates, on
 labels, going way back.

 Then a whole page of garden gnomes.

 BEAN starts to look for something in particular.      DAVID uses the pause to
 broach the awful subject.

</b>              Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've
              been here twelve all...

 BEAN has    found what he was looking for. It is the picture of the family
 that he    took from the landing on his first night here. What's left of the
 Polaroid    of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from BRUTUS, is stuck
 next to    it. He's even written - 'Bean & Family' - he doesn't realise there's
 anything    sad about it. But DAVID is rather moved. Pause.

              it) ... to say good night. Okay?

BEAN nods.    DAVID smiles and goes to the door.

BE-AN waves good-bye a little rudely and gets back to the album. Even when we
feel sorry for him, he's a little rude. DAVID walks away, shaking his head.

The first morning without ALISON.    "She's Gone" by Hall & Oats begins to play,
a song full of yearning.

DAVID feels the other side of the bed.    No-one there.

He walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Then walks back into the
bedroom - She's gone - I've got to learn how to face it " He takes a towel
from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom. He feels very alone.

He removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam-filled shower. - she's gone -

BEAN has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself,
wearing ALISON's shower cap. manly screams from the both of them.

 10 am U.K.    time. (The following takes place in a matter of seconds) Close on
 the T.V. A    morning kids show blares out. A huge wardrobe stands four feet
 away from    a wall. There is a string tied to one of it's door handles,
 stretching    out of shot. The wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an
 angel. It     rocks slightly and creaks. (Feature its padlock).

 There is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see-saw
 fashion. One end of it is wedged under the wardrobe.

 BEAN's G.P.O. phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of
 BEETHOVEN to fall over the edge of the table. It lands on the end of the
 ironing board. The Wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls
 against the wall with a heavy thump! and raising of dust. The string tied
 to its handle becomes taut.

CUT TO: the T.V. plug in its socket. This end of the string is tied to it.
The string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket.

 BEAN and DAVID do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts - along corridors -
 in an elevator. A sense of expectation and excitement. En route, they are
 joined by ELMER, the huge Security Guard.

 The three arrive outside a large oak door. ELMER ceremoniously unlocks the
 door, all the time glaring at BEAN - who swallows hard. A light turns green
 and a buzzer sounds.

 Then there is the door to the inner sanctum. ELMER stares at BEAN as he
 unlocks it. Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds.

face, a magical golden glow.

BEAN nods. DAVID leaves him.         BEAN is still for a while and then goes up and
inspects it closely.

He tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame. He blows
it away fussily. He steps back to admire the painting. There is dust up his
nose and... SNEEZE - all over the painting!

He takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic. Then looks
back at the painting. Unfortunately, there now seems to be a big blue mark
right across Mrs Whistler's face..

BEAN checks his handkerchief. Yes, there's wet ink all over it. He finds the
leaking pen in his pocket. 0 God. He takes out his shirt, spits on it and
tries to wipe the painting, but he can't make the shirt reach it. He takes
the painting down from the wall and has another go. NO GOOD! The ink just
spreads right over Whistler's Mother's pure white collar.

BEAN    now looks round in panic. What the hell can he do? He goes to the heavy
door    - and looks out into the corridor. He hears someone coming, hides and
sees    a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly squeaky trolley
past,    covered with a white cloth.
<b>
</b>He goes back in - and has an idea.        He goes to a little table in the corner
and begins to take thing off it.

The    door opens, and    BEAN emerges, pushing what appears to be a trolley covered
with    a white cloth.     Although, if you look carefully, this trolley actually
has    no legs. It is     the painting covered with the table cloth. To make it a
bit    more convincing,    BEAN makes an apt squeaky noise.

He proceeds along the thin corridor - and then sees another exactly similar
trolley coming right towards him.' A problem. As they get close, BEAN
suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on-coming man.

                What the ... !!!

When    the   man turns, BEAN just twists his painting sideways and shoots past
him.     We   see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley-pusher when he looks
back    and   BEAN is no longer there. He turns round to BEAN, who turns back to
him    with   a totally blank and innocent look. BEAN sees an elevator and heads
for    it.

</b>                Second floor.

BEAN manages to get the painting into trolley position before the doors open
to a group of six very fat middle aged people. They all wear large badges
declaring them to be members of a 'Diet Club'. They squeeze into the elevator
along both sides of BEAN's trolley. There is a very, very, THIN WOMAN behind
them who can't fit on.

The doors close. As the painting is wedged against the fat people's stomachs
on both sides, BEAN is able to let go of it and make a great show of checking
his watch. He nonchalantly, drums the fingers of both hands on the top of the
trolley'. The bell dings.

             though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that
             way, huh?

DAVID doesn't quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely.

Now we see BEAN's plan -    he has emerged at a nearby window. He    can't reach
the painting at first.     So he stretches further and further out   the window.
No good. Finally he has     to go out on the ledge. He shoos away    the birds, who
then decide to settle on    him instead. Finally he gets a hand on    the painting.
As he does so, he loses    hold. He just manages to grabs a window    before he
falls.

</b>             Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure.

Period.

BEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the
painting. It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. DAVID turns to go.

<b>                                        BERNIE
</b>             By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but
             I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the
             balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or
             we're all in the
             crap house. What     do you think?

             comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll

A small storeroom where Bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through
the window. He has the picture and is safe.

He sets the picture down on a table.      Darn!   The birds have done their
business on it.
<b>
</b>He maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf. He
chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs.
This smells like the right sort of stuff. He pours the liquid on to a rag and
rubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the
ink stain. Whistler's Mother looks as good as new.

BEAN is so, so, relieved. But then he notices something else happening.      The
liquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing
Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror,
America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas.

BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought.     Removing the pen
that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back    on Whistler's
Mother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where       once was a
sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks    a little like
Danny de Vito.

Bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. Unfortunately,
there's a nail there. The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more.
Total destruction.

step into the room and freezes.

The    very fat 'Diet Club, people are seated at easels, paint brushes poised.

BEAN gets back to the right rooms and closes the door desperately behind him.

He stands frozen for a second - and at that moment, a hand tries the door.
<b>
</b>BEAN leaps at it and stops. the handle turning. Then there's a knock. BEAN
moves the big table in front of the door - he's barricading himself in.
There's a famous Rodin sculpture in there - he shoves it along to block, the
door as well. When he's succeeded, he leans hot and sweaty against it - and a
door on the other side of the room calmly opens and .... DAVID walks in.

He rushes to the door he just came in - and locks it.

             Wait a minute - why am I worrying about this? I did it. I just go
             out and tell them what happened - you're a madman from England and
             you did this terrible thing and it's not my fault. That's right,
             isn't it?

BEAN nods, knowing he deserves his doom.

             Perfect - and then they say - who left him alone with the
             picture?" And I say - "me". And they say "you're fired". And I
             say ' right'. And so I get fired and you go to jail and no one's
             any happier.

BEAN shakes his head.

             And then they say, "firing David isn't enough - let's prosecute
             him for negligence. And they prosecute me and it turns out I was
             negligent and I go to jail, and my wife leaves me and my daughter
             becomes a prostitute and I end up on Death Row sharing a cell with
             Butch McDick, the infamous gay rapist - or worse, I end up in the
             same cell as you!

BEAN looks hurt.
<b>
</b>             No, no...Now, let's just be calm let's think about this calmly.
             (he tries - and fails ... ) Oh Godigodigod! Okay, now wait.
             Let's have another look at it.

BEAN shows it to him.

             Jesus!!! I'm already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as paradise.
             5 minutes ago - just walking along, shooting the breeze with my
             old pal Bernie.

BEAN then he has a brilliant idea. He hangs the painting back up in the
security cupboard and closes the doors. Then he removes from his pocket a
small note book.

<b>                                                                               66

He scribbles something on it, tears the page out, licks it and sticks it on
the cupboard door. It reads `OUT OF ORDER'.

BEAN is delighted.

             Apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the
             cupboard will say -"Look, someone's totally destroyed Whistler's
             Mother- let's kill them".

BEAN is less delighted.

              No - the most important thing is tbat no-one sees it.
              Ever again!

He locks the cupboard with his plastic card key-

               That's the first thing. Then ... that's the first thing....
               Next ... next is the next thing which is... obviously... ritual
               suicide. Look, let's get out of here. Try to act natural.

The let themselves out and go into the corridor- BEAN acting his version of
`natural' - very liquid.

BEAN hudders at the thought of his paint-choosing.

The colours are beginning to fade. However ~     if you give me just one little
year I can restore the picture to its original    glory, the way it looked when
Whistler's Mom first looked at it and said....    0 Actually I'm not sure you've

It is very late and very gloomy. Just a couple of loners staring into their
drinks. The BARTENDER is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the
sports pages. There is a T.V. on above the bar, showing baseball.

<b>                                                                                   69
</b>
BEAN and DAVID are sitting up at the bar. The latter has had far too much
whisky and looks the worse for it. BEAN has a tall glass packed with fruit
and paper umbrellas. We can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he
has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth. DAVID almost, but not quite,
slurs his words:

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>             It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job -
             lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?

He turns to BEAN who has the end of a straw up his nose.

<b>                                        DAVID
</b>             I guess not.

He fills his glass from a bottle.
<b>
</b>            You know, I don't get it. The New Artist     exhibition-this year -
            people might not all have liked the dead    sheep, but ... the place
            didn't look that empty to me. It wasn't     full but I saw people. I
            just don't understand how the gallery can    be so bankrupt they have
            to sell the Whistler.

He looks at BEAN who now has peanuts in each nostril.
DAVID notices the BARTENDER looking at BEAN strangely ....

<b>                                      DAVID
</b>            He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it?

BARTENDER goes back to reading. DAVID searches for his last train of thought,
taking a huge swig from his drink.

<b>                                    DAVID
</b>            ... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an
            artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a
            figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then,
            I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the
            problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before
            I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.

<b>                                                                                 70
</b>

BEAN at that moment is keen to show DAVID his nut trick. He throws a peanut
high into the air - and catches it in his mouth. Then does two. Then does it
with his eyes closed. Actually, it's rather impressive.

<b>                                    DAVID
</b>             Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine.
             Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I
             just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself.
             Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I
             should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I
             tell you something, Beanie ...

Bean has been interested all this, even looking to    check whether David does
indeed have no spine. But now the baseball on the     TV is making it hard for
him to concentrate on-this important confidence.     He raises a finger, for
DAVID to be quiet for a second. He blows a peanut     from his, nostril at the
T.V. - it hits the button, and changes station to    a pleasant quiet-music
station.

<b>                                    DAVID
</b>             Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?

 BEAN nods his head, very curious, listening hard.

             This is it. Because you moved into my house, my wife has left
             me. She might have done it anyway - but you were the ten ton
             weight that broke the camel's spinal column.

BEAN stares at DAVID - something is getting in he's actually registering this.

             That's point one. And point two - is that you've destroyed
             Whistler's Mother, which was' the last hope for the place where
             I work. So within a week, I'm going to lose my job as well.

BEAN nods, seriously dispirited.

             better if I'd never been born.

He puts his hand on BEAN'S shoulder.     BEAN looks down.

Very sad. This is actually the first time in his life that he's realised that
his actions have really effected the life of another person. BEAN looks up
sadly. Sad music plays.

room.


<b>INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    BEAN'S ROOM- NIGHT.
</b>
BEAN is lying, fully dressed, in the darkness, on his back. Thinking.
Worried by what he's heard. Then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes.      The
music is like his brain He jumps off the bed.

There follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence. But
the 'tools' here are distinctly bizarre. BEAN picks up his suitcase, and in
quick cuts, rushes through the house and collects....

<b>EXT.   GALLERY.   NIGHT.
</b>
The building is floodlit by ground spots.

BEAN arrives silently, with suitcase, on the skateboard. Soon his full plan
will be revealed. The Gallery is empty, apart from the one Security Guard,
<b>
</b>BUCK, visible through the glass front of the building, drinking coffee,
watching his 12 security monitors. BEAN swallows at the sight of BUCK - he is
a massive gorilla of a man.

<b>                                                                            CUT TO:

<b>INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.    RECEPTION - NIGHT.
</b>
BUCK is casually watching his screens, when suddenly, horror of horror, the
huge silhouette of a person hanging .themselves from a tree outside appears,
the shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery wall. BUCK
frantically rushes out. And BEAN subtly slips in.

<b>                                                                            CUT TO:
</b>

<b>EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT.
</b>
BUCK is looking for the body amongst the trees. He finds nothing. Because he
fails to notice the tiny ACTION MAN swinging gently in front of one of the
ground-level floodlights.

<b>                                                                            CUT TO:
</b>

<b>INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT'.
</b>
Inside, BEAN is casually pouring the entire       contents of DAVID's large laxative
tin into BUCK's coffee. He also swaps two        keys on the board of keys by the
desk. He then takes the opportunity to put        the oven gloves on his feet, one
shaped like a pig, one like a crocodile, so       he can move silently.

BUCK returns. He sits down, and takes a long gulp of coffee. Pause. BEAN
watches. BUCK feels something uncomfortable in his stomach. He takes a key
from his rack of keys, and sets off and rounds a corner- On a monitor screen,
BEAN watches him break into a canter - as he passes through another monitor
BUCK is at full sprint. BEAN giggles.

BEAN is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while. He goes to the key-
rack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission. The next 3 minutes of
film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios:

<b>                                                                                 73
</b>

FIRST: BUCK - his next 10    minutes    are not happy ones. When he reaches the
toilet, the key he chose    does not    unlock it. He has to sprint back, grab all
the keys, and charge back    again to    the door. Then he has to try out every
single key. We never see     him find    the right one.

SECOND scenario - all the    activities of the night shown on the security
monitors. BUCK sprinting     desperately through shot - BEAN casually going about
his business and, on one    occasion, BUCK running right past BEAN, but not
seeing him - he has other    things on his mind.

THIRD scenario - we actually see BEAN's Big Plan.

He unlocks the merchandise shop. So he can see properly and have his hands
free, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a
head-lamp. He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with
<b>
</b>the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl. He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4
encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down.

He separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish
and varnishes the-poster with it. Dries it off with the hair drier.

,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the
Whistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. Once there, he
unlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down
and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support
frame. He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame.

He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and
relocks it with DAVID's key card.

The job is done.     He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin,
and heads off.

 all its untorn, unsmudged,      undestroyed glory.

A powerful motorbike turns into the drive at speed and skids round to face the
opposite direction. JENNIFER runs over to it. The bike's rider turns off his
engine and removes his helmet. It is STINGO, the white Rasta from the
airport, with the hair extensions and the sixty rings in his nose.

She slaps STINGO on the shoulder.    STINGO kicks the starter lever.    Nothing.

BEAN instantly takes on the hero's mantle and runs to the bike. DAVID is not
far behind him. STINGO is still trying to kick start it. BEAN takes out a
small screwdriver and twiddles with something on the engine.

The bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the drive
and down the road. BEAN stands, hands on hips, looking very-pleased with
himself indeed.

the girls in a Toulouse-Lautrec painting actually dance the can-can.

<b>                                      GRIERSON
</b>             Well, congratulations.    Isn't that great, David?

</b>             Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a
             winning team.

DAVID slightly embarrassed not to be included in the winning team.      He looks

KEVIN and BEAN have found a computer,    also showing BERNIE's Gallery programme.
The monitor shows the interior of the    ground floor of the gallery. KEVIN
clicks, and up comes the same Toulouse    Lautrec picture. As KEVIN works the
mouse, BEAN hums the catchy tune from    'GOBLINS 21. It's play time again.

<b>                                     KEVIN

He clicks again, and a tiny talking Toulouse Lautrec starts to explain the
provenance of the painting.

DAVID is overseeing things. There's a burgundy rope, keeping people a bit
away from the case in which Whistler's Mother is contained. ELMER brings in
two large flower displays. BERNIE enters.

</b>             Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who
             actually gets things done.

He exits. BERNIE is growing in confidence - and getting nastier by the
minute. DAVID pulls a face at ELMER.

The final touches in the preparation for the big visit to up-tempo, "we're
getting ready" music.

1.    Gardeners gardening, window cleaners cleaning, polishers polishing etc.
And someone empties a dustbin, in the midst of which we glimpse something
which might be a scrunched up old Whistler painting.

</b>2.    BERNIE watches as someone plugs in a plug - and a huge video screen in
the gallery flickers and starts up.

3.    ANNIE at her counter, reading a book called 'The Art of Conversational.
She shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an
imaginary V.I.P.

4.    ELMER, in the men's room mirror, trims his hair around his peaked hat
with scissors. He has a row of war medals on his chest. He polishes them
proudly with his sleeve.

5.    GRIERSON watches through the front glass - a red carpet rolls itself out
from the gallery's main entrance to stop by the rear door of a black car.

Close on the bottom    of the black cars rear door. It opens and a pair of legs,
wearing black shoes    and charcoal trousers, step out onto the red carpet. As
they walk purposely    up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to
reveal that this is    BERNIE. It's a rehearsal. He is met with a hand shake by
GRIERSON at the main    entrance.

ELMER puts on a defiant face. DAVID shakes his head disapprovingly.        GRIERSON
moves BERNIE to meet DAVID. They

'Shake hands.

BEAN at the computer. He's actually quite enjoying himself now. In fact,
he's rather hogging the thing. This is, after all, an animated catalogue -
his area.

<b>                                                                                83

</b>             I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything.      Truth is,
             she smells kinda nice. okay? (grins).

BEAN smiles and gives KEVIN a thumbs-up.       KEVIN returns the gesture and
exits..

Back to the computer, BEAN clicks on an icon which takes him to the ground
floor gallery. He clicks through various paintings and stops at the painting
of the woman, in the castle, wearing the chastity belt. BEAN clicks and
enlarges the painting to fill the screen.

He happily hums the catchy tune from 'GOBLINS 2' and homes in on the tiny
padlock on the chastity belt. Padlocks interest him. He clicks on the
keyhole rapidly (as we have seen him do with the frog in GOBLINS 2).

<b>                                     MR. BEAN
</b><b>
</b>             Click! click! click! click! click!

.Suddenly, to BEAN's surprise, the padlock starts to flash red...then the
whole screen starts to flash ... before going dramatically back to black ...
Now flashing in the .centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key. Beneath
it, a row of six dashes appears (e.g - - - - - - - ). A cursor is flashing
over the first dash.

BEAN is totally absorbed. He loves these kinds of puzzles. With one finger,
he slowly types out letters on the keyboard (he has to search for some of
them). As he does so, they appear over each dash in turn:

<b>                                 G-O-B-L-I-N
</b>A message pops up: "ACCESS DENIED" BEAN tries something 0 else.
<b>                                 G-N-O-M-E-S
</b>The message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. The room door suddenly opens! Making
BEAN jump! It's BERNIE. He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.

<b>                                       BERNIE
</b>         How goes it, Bean?    Ready for the Governor?

BEAN smiles and nods nervously.       He knows he's probably up to something he
shouldn't be.




<b>                                                                                   84

           Period. Oh, And put this on.

BERNIE throws BEAN a name badge with 'Dr. Bean' on it. BEAN nods. BERNIE
exits. BEAN goes back to the code. He types in the first thing that comes
into his head:

<b>                                      B-E-R-N-I-E
</b>
That damned message again: `ACCESS DENIED'.         Then, as though something is
dawning on him, he punches in:

<b>                                      P-E-R-I-0-D
</b>
Up comes a message: "CODE ACCEPTED". Close on BEAN's face as light from the
computer plays on it- He reads it carefully and with interest. We cant quite
read his expression - but what he sees is a surprise and a puzzle. Long
meaningful pause as his eyes scan the screen.

army boots and khaki trousers.

The legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us. Camera pans up to
show us that GOVERNOR REYNOLDS is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of
medals and forage cap. He is a grand figure. In fact - he's exactly the same
grand figure Mr BEAN caused epic problems To on the plane over. He gives his
prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before
heading on.

BRUTUS and his SIDE-KICK COP fall into step behind him.       They are the Police
presence today.

GRIERSON and BERNIE greet REYNOLDS at the entrance.

GRIERSON is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit.       BERNIE is
frowning - not happy about that uniform.

<b>                                    GRIERSON

             Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.

BERNIE's smile melts away. As they enter the gallery, BERNIE hopefully offers
the car keys to BRUTUS - who rewards him with a "don't be stupid" smile and
follows the Governor.

BEAN (wearing "Dr Bean" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door,
thus just missing REYNOLDS. BERNIE sees him and jumps on the chance to
delegate.

 car. Yummy!

BEAN has let himself into the car. It's one of the happiest moments of his
life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather
seat.

He starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park. He sweeps
dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact.
Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left.
<b>
</b>BEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the
one he's used to.

He takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and
measures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't
large enough.

With a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in
between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process.
BEAN looks a tadge concerned.

Finally, he pulls a lever - and the bonnet      pops up an inch.

At which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat. BEAN is
still looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the
seat beside him. Not good news.

 BEAN panics a bit, turns and half      climbs over into    the back   seat, when he
 spies a drinks cabinet. He has a       very good idea -    he finds   a cut crystal
 decanter of brown liquid, opens it      and uses it to    douse the   fire. Not a
 wise move with brandy. Before the       cut, we see the    WHOOOSH!   of a major fire
 in the front seat of the car.

GRIERSON leads REYNOLDS towards the main gallery. He points up to the video

every screen in the gallery. REYNOLDS is impressed. He glances at DAVID in
passing.

The front of the car isn't    what it was. There has been a big fire. It's out
now - three decanters lie    empty. BEAN is not happy. Finally, he decides to
go for brute strength. He     turns the car on again, puts it into reverse, and
puts his foot down on the    accelerator.

We see the car from above. Full throttle. Totally still. Totally still.
And then WHOOOOSH WHAM!!! It reverses at 100 mph straight backwards, smashing
violently into and destroying the back of the car behind _ as it happens,
Bernie's car.

BEAN is inspecting the car. He's not too happy with it. '.He tries to get
the bonnet down, but it insists on staying up. He shrugs his shoulders and
gets in to drive off again, having to wind down the window and drive by
leaning his head out. This means that as he heads for the exit, he fails to
see the system to stop people leaving without paying, a foot high barrier that
appears out of the ground. When he hits it, the car stops dead.
<b>
</b>BEAN gets out,    leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the
attendant would    be - but everyone is in the gallery at the moment. Inside he
pushes a couple    of buttons, and, hurrah, gets the one that drops the barrier.
Less hurrah, he    has forgotten to put on the hand brake.

As he moves    back towards the car, it glides slowly down the ramp on the
outside of    the building, then accelerates, and finally, on a particularly
sharp turn,    smashes through the wall, and flies off the building. We hear a
crash - but    do not see where it lands.

The party follows DAVID as he walks through the gallery, towards the double

</b>              Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother
              before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank you.

It's part of his plan of caution - he knows there's something wrong - and
wants as few people as possible to .see the painting close up. The crowd
moves back.

REYNOLDS is flattered. Silence. DAVID inserts the plastic card key - opens
the doors - and sure enough there in all its glory is Whistler's Mother'.
Respectful silence.

REYNOLDS is delighted.     He stands back to inspect her.

<b>                                     REYNOLDS

People start to file out. REYNOLDS, GRIERSON, BERNIE and DAVID stay behind.
DAVID spots BEAN arriving. He hands the car keys back to BERNIE with a
slightly dazed smile. DAVID eagerly takes his arm and brings him over.

</b>             Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from
             England.

They turn to each other - recognition from BEAN "it's the man from the plane".
He does a very quick hand-shake and tries to make a getaway before REYNOLDS
recognises him...

</b>             Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ...

BEAN turns. In fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone
getting too close to the great painting. He spins and falls in the direction
of the painting.

CUT TO: the looks of horror on all the faces.

CUT TO: BEAN, reaching out to keep himself standing. We think he's going to
tear the painting. He doesn't. He simply catches hold of the bottom of the
ornate frame. It ,,snaps off.

CUT TO: a look of relief for an instant on all faces.

CUT TO: the truth - as the frame breaks off, there is the little white strip,
saying, THE GRIERSON GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S MOTHER"-

CUT TO: a look of horror on all faces.

CUT TO: ELMER looking like someone has just murdered his own mother.

CUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK glowering at BEAN.

</b>DAVID and BEAN stand alone in silence, in front of the debris. BEAN is
absolutely destitute. DAVID stares at him. BEAN just lifts his hands.
Totally sad. What will, what can DAVID say to him? Finally, DAVID just puts
his hands on his shoulder.

rush out of the building. ELMER, BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK give chase.

A chauffeur driven, open top limo, pulls up next to DAVID's car. BEAN looks
out of his window to see the BAG LADY, from the mall robbery, sitting in the
back. She is still wearing her filthy clothes. She raises a glass of
champagne to BEAN and smiles.

BEAN waves back uncertainly.     He's sure he's seen her before - a vague memory.

CUT TO: ELMER's CAR is in the traffic queue about ten cars back. BRUTUS and
SIDE-KICK get out and start running down the line towards DAVID's car.

The lights are green. DAVID puts his foot down and the car screeches away
just as BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK are within inches it.

CUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK turn on their heels and head back to ELMER's car.
They are very unfit.

They are just about to jump in the car when gun shots are heard from a near-by
gas station- BRUTUS turns and sees a .robbery in progress. A man with a gun
is about to run away. BRUTUS is torn, not knowing which quarry to pursue.

BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK draw their guns and run towards the gas station. In a
moment of confusion - a shot rings out. We think in the corner of our eye
that we see BRUTUS fall to the ground, as ELMER screeches away after DAVID's
car.

picks it up and follows him he's trying to be useful.

ELMER is obviously moved to find out about JENNIFER. He moves towards the

civvies, sitting with outpatients.

BUCK looks up, painfully, goes to say something, then dashes into a men's room
close-by. ELMER shakes his head and leaves.

BEAN still following DR JACOBSON, who goes through more swing doors and then
suddenly disappears. BEAN sees a big "4" above a door and goes in, holding
the Stethoscope. A nurse accosts him instantly. She reads his name badge.

<b>                                       NURSE 2

</b>              Actually ... (huge sigh) ... Yes, yes, yes...

She immediately slips the white coat onto BEAN, and the gloves, and the mask.

ALISON, DAVID and KEVIN are sitting on the bench opposite JENNIFER's room.
KEVIN picks up JENNIFER's SUPER NINTENDO console from the bench. DAVID
notices this. ALISON answers his look.

<b>                                                                             99

</b>           Good thinking. (pause) You still call it 'home'.

ALISON looks at him seriously.


<b>INT.   OPERATING THEATRE.   NIGHT.
</b>
Inside the operating theatre, a body is waiting in position. There are 3
attending nurses and an assistant doctor. They all look up to BEAN as he
enters, fully kitted up.

<b>                                   ASSISTANT
</b>             Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the
             lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's
             severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.

<b>                                       NURSE 2
</b>             He's coming round.
<b>
</b><b>                                   ASSISTANT
</b>             Give him a T 70, straight away.

The victim starts to move - he looks up - we see his face for the first time.
It is the police officer, BRUTUS. He is in great pain. As the sedative shot
goes in, BEAN takes off his mask, and smiles, with a little wave. A look of
total panic goes over BRUTU'S eyes, as he loses consciousness.

<b>                                   ASSISTANT
</b>              Shall I do the cut, sir?

BEAN nods - he's not going to argue with anyone. The assistant cuts. BEAN is
horrified, almost faints, then snatches the knife. He can't believe this
maniac has just cut through another personas flesh.

<b>                                                                             100

<b>                                   ASSISTANT
</b>             I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.

BEAN hands the knife to the NURSE testily.

<b>                                     NURSE
</b>             I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll
             never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support
             systems.

EVERYONE turns to get on    with their particular jobs. BEAN is left with the
body. A pause. He gets      a little bored. Takes a sweet packet out of his
pocket. Only one sweet     left. he takes it out lovingly, and then does what he
always does - throws it    up into the air, to catch it in his mouth.

Unfortunately, he forgets that he is wearing a mask.     It hits the middle of
the mask and bounces into the cut in the body.

BEAN looks down annoyed. Checks round him - everyone's 'still busy. So he
puts his hand in the body, really rummages around, finds the sweet, takes it
out, and then realises he's in fact got the bullet between his fingers.
..Guiltily, he slips it back into the body, rummages a bit more, finds the
sweet, wipes it, & pops it in his mouth. At which second the X-ray arrives.

<b>                                   ASSISTANT
</b>              Here we go, doctor. ( STUDYING THE X-RAY ) the bullet is here -
              so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all
              better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.

BEAN tuts scornfully - 'you're wrong 1, reaches in again, feels around for a
second, and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers.

They all applaud.

<b>                                                                         CUT TO:

BEAN exits from the theatre - still in gown and mask, followed by the
assistant. The police SIDE-KICK is waiting.

<b>                                   SIDE-KICK
</b>             Any news on the chief?.

SIDE-KICK's eyes water. He's choked. BEAN shakes his hand nervously, and
heads on fast before he's found out. He turns the corner and suddenly sees
DAVID and ALISON, still seated. ALISON sees him.

<b>                          ALISON
</b>            0 my god.

<b>                                    DAVID
</b>             Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.

<b>                                    ALISON
</b>            Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?

She turns her head away: the bond of the moments before is gone.       BEAN looks
very contrite. At that moment, another doctor walks by.

<b>                                      DAVID
</b>            Excuse me.

<b>                                   DOCTOR 2
</b>            Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to
            deal with here, sir.

ALISON looks round, and shakes her head. BEAN kicks DAVID in the shins.
DAVID looks round, puzzled. There is a poster of the human skeleton. BEAN
points to the spine. DAVID looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from
it.

Another doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first.       He's
young, confident slightly arrogant.

<b>                                     ALISON

<b>                                     ALISON
</b>            Okay.

DAVID looks at the poster opposite again. Spine, ribcage, skull. Looks back
at Bean gesturing to it. This time the penny drops! Spine spineless!

<b>                                                                                102

</b>            I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll
            make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less
            healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.

               Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end
               of the world.

A hint of a smile arrives on ALISON's lips. She's heard that somewhere before.

<b>                                                DAVID

               and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going
               to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence

DAVID turns to ALISON - she does a little tilt of her
Head `WOW'. And he turns to BEAN, who points to
himself,    and nods .... n Come on!

KEVIN    is sitting on the end of the bed playing the SUPER NINTENDO game (the
Gothic    Vampire thing, with bats and he-men, we saw on JENNIFER'S TV earlier).
It is    plugged into a T.V. which sits on a trolley. It's quite a noisy game.

</b>JENNIFER is still asleep. BEAN is sitting on the end of her bed. He looks at
the SUPER NINTENDO console thinking, "How can I get this working again? How
can I help?" The only sound in the room is the beeping from the E.C.G.
machine, monitoring Jennifer's heart. BEAN has an idea.

He yanks off the jack plug at the end of the Super Nintendo lead.        Producing
his small screwdriver, he starts to unscrew the console casing.

She and DAVID manage to share a smile. They're going to get through this.
Suddenly, we hear noise from the vampire game, coming from JENNIFER's room.
KEVIN registers this and is puzzled. Then ALISON and DAVID notice it.

<b>INT.   HOSPITAL.     JENNIFER'S ROOM - DAY

The LEARYS appear in the open doorway.       Their expressions turn from curiosity
to horror.

BEAN has plugged the SUPER NINTENDO games system into the       back of JENNIFER's
E.C.G. monitor. A couple of bats are flapping about the        screen but the most
worrying thing here (shown in close-up) is the sight of a       he-man type, jumping
up and down, lashing out, with his sword, at the passing       pulse light, showing
Jennifer's faint vital signs ...

ALISON gasps.      DAVID slowly moves into the room.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>             Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you
             hear me? Come on now...

But BEAN is determined to keep going - it's his way of reviving Jennifer.
DAVID approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce ... CUT
TO: a close-up of the monitor. The he-man chases the pulse light ...

DAVID dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his
sword. DAVID has landed on top of JENNIFER. The pulse light explodes and the
monitor screen whites-out. JENNIFER wakes up with a start.

ALISON covers her mouth, tearful, but she can't hold it back.        She laughs.
<b>
</b>DAVID and KEVIN stare at JENNIFER. They can't help but join in the laughter.
JENNIFER has no idea what's going on. BEAN is happy that everyone is happy.

</b>             I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back

ALISON grins at him.      Then at BEAN.

He just stands there.

             okay - you grind the beans, and


He moves towards her - his arms slip round her waist.

He's a bit impatient.

They jump apart.      The moment is gone.

ALISON takes out two single socks which have been neatly wrapped around a
couple of drinks mats and put in the toaster slots.

BEAN beams at her.      He's impressed - and feels he's accepted.    He leaves.

With heavy hearts everyone is gathered to hear their fate. Pan across the
familiar faces. DAVID. BERNIE. ELMER. ANNIE. BEAN, looking nervous and
shifty. Dead silence as GRIERSON stands, very solemnly.

<b>                                    GRIERSON
</b>             Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday
             teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would
             have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent
             philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself
             for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had
             realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell
             her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership
             flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice-
             President.


CUT TO BERNIE, looking smug next to DAVID, who is pretty shocked by this.

               the 21st century.

<b>                                          BERNIE
</b>               Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we
               can ...

<b>                                    GRIERSON
</b>               Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive
               interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask,
               survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?
               Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we
               find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a
               criminal of great genius.

BEAN looks pleased - but then realises it's not a suitable emotion ~ so nods
sagely.

               Insurance? Not a chance. Those bastards never pay. So,
               surely we're bankrupt? Surely your jobs are forfeit? Surely
               you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as
               waiters and boys? Yes. Yes indeed. Except for one little
               thing. one little thing done by one little man. Dare I say,
               one helluva little man. Watch this.

Everyone is totally at a     loss. GRIERSON stands and moves to the framed poster
of Whistler's Mother on     the wall. He then produces a plastic key card and
inserts it in a slot on     the side of the frame. A buzz and a click! An
electric motor starts to     whirrrr ...
<b>
</b>The glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides
gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the
original oil of Whistler's Mother.

<b>                                    GRIERSON
</b>               Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother!

There are gasps from the room.     BEAN is open mouthed.

GRIERSON beams as many applaud and BEAN now joins in hyperactively.      He's
saved!

<b>                              GRIERSON

                you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new
                Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the
                computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were
                so rudely interrupted by events.

The room is emptying.     DAVID and BEAN stand there, DAVID stunned.   GRIERSON
heads over.

<b>                                    GRIERSON
</b>               Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct,
               relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred,
               through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I
               trust Bernie will be able to reverse.

               will.

BERNIE looks across from the computer and smiles.      BEAN has his eyes on DAVID.
He is mortified by what's

happening.   GRIERSON notices but misinterprets his worried expression.


<b>                                    GRIERSON
</b>               Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation
               for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite
               bathroom.

DAVID glares at BERNIE.     BEAN is thinking 'No!   I don't want to stay with
horrible BERNIE.'

              There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me
              up!

Pause. All eyes turn to BEAN.     CUT TO people watching the big screens
everywhere.

 BEAN looks long and hard at BERNIE.

</b>              Yes- (PAUSE) It's exceedingly rude to point.

And punches BERNIE sharply in the nose.    Everyone in the gallery bursts into
applause.

Half an hour later. Police cars draw up.      BERNIE is shoved in the back seat
of one. GRIERSON, BEAN & DAVID watch.

<b>
</b>             also ask him a few questions about the destruction of the
             Whistler copy.

BEAN nods his head firmly.    The car pulls away.     Then breaks and reverses.
The SIDE-KICK gets out.

<b>                                     SIDE~KICK
</b>            Oh, yeah - I forgot.

SIDE-KICK opens the back of the car.    He takes out a huge bunch of flowers.

             The chief said I was to give you these.

BEAN is delighted. Then sniffs the flowers.      What a nasty stink.    Not his
sort of thing at all.

SIDE-KICK drives AWAY.   GRIERSON turns to DAVID.

<b>                                   GRIERSON
</b>            I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise
            me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that
            you do not.

</b>            VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

He looks sideways to Bean, who is frantically pointing to his spine.       DAVID
gets the message, and changes his tune..

            Let me think about that, Thomas.     We'd have to talk quite a salary
            hike.

<b>                                     GRIERSON

            Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of
            time to make up.

DAVID heads off. BEAN wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky
flowers. He turns to ANNIE and gives them to her to be rid of them. She
beams with delight: after all, he DID love her.

BEAN heads off with DAVID to the parking lot.       As they go, DAVID puts an arm
<b>
</b>round BEAN.

Who shoos him away instantly.           No sloppiness for him.

She goes to kiss BEAN - but he just sticks out his hand, and shakes it firmly.
Then moves on to JENNIFER.

BEAN, KEVIN    & DAVID    get into the car. It pulls away, as they drive off, BEAN
sticks his    hand of    the window - and waves a last farewell to ALISON and
JENNIFER.     At last    a sentimental moment - romantic music swelling - like Liza
Minelli at    the end    of "Cabaret".

Until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as the
car squeezes past.

The three 30 year old women, dressed in curly red wigs from the musical,
'Annie', hug and kiss their little BALD MAN and send him off through the
gates. They shriek and wave him good-bye. DAVID, KEVIN and BEAN are there.

<b>                                       DAVID

BEAN delighted. Promotion is in his sights. He studies his watch.              He's
being polite but held really like to get going.

              it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.

BEAN    nods abruptly, picks up his case, checks his watch and goes. He doesn't
look    back. Kevin and David turn and walk away. DAVID does stop to look back
over    his shoulder at BEAN, heading off in the distance. But BEAN doesn't
turn,    so DAVID walks on.

Then there is suddenly a tap on his shoulder. It's BEAN, ,as though he's
magically jumped there. He gives DAVID a big bear hug, a big grin, and then a
little wave - and heads away. In the distance, he treads on the back of ,some
one's shoe.

The place    is totally empty except for a CLEANER sweeping up litter in the

BEAN is utterly perplexed. He looks round the corner into another empty
gallery, and shakes his head.

wood on some wooden structure.

He walks    away from it - without us seeing what it is
and goes    to his Mini, where TEDDY sits on a pile of books in the front seat,
wearing a    seat belt. Bean gets into the car, which is laden with suitcases,
starts it    up and drives ....

.... straight into the huge crate he has built.     A rope tied to the back
bumper pulls the lid closed behind him.
