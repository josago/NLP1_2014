               A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far 
               away--

<b>               EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY
</b>
               We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from 
               sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- 
               a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A 
               white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap 
               comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an 
               oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, 
               and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in 
               the Mother's hands.

<b>                                     MOTHER
</b>                         Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks 
                         up the free cheese, 'kay?

               She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, 
               then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her 
               baseball cap and places it on the baby.

<b>                                     MOTHER
</b>                         This'll keep the sun out of your 
                         eyes. You be good now.

               She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. 
               With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his 
               mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks 
               kind of familiar.

               Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS 
               concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair 
               enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. 
               She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets 
               her Baby down beside him.

                         machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.

               A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He 
               takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the 
               record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.

                         babies?

                         Leave'em out here like that and see 
                         what happens.

               The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.

                         outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!

               The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat. 
               Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing. 
               The smaller one says--

                         eighties style.

               Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against 
               the wall.

               Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door 
               behind him.

                         ass.

               He exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After

               Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.

               Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled "Los

               a beat, they re-emerge.

               Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across 
               the aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld 
               video game. He leans over to him.

</b>                         Leave me alone, little kid.

               The Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning 
               to Silent Bob.

                         gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!

               Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, "He's 
               ten years old."

               Silent Bob kind of nods.

</b>                         So go open a can of whup-ass on that 
                         little fuck, and get me his game!

               Silent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the 
               aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and 
               registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on. 

               Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches 
               for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts 
               punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his 
               seat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay 
               looks at Silent Bob.

               amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the 
               bus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed 
               into the bathroom, holding a massive joint.

               Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.

               A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy 
               points to it, as if to say "See?" The passenger-side door 
               opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He 
               looks out the window at Jay and Bob.

               Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go 
               face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers 
               smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.

               Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR 
               pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window 
               and leans toward them.

                         to say you live by the Book than to 
                         actually do it.

               Jay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head 
               "no." Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and 
               starts to bend down.

               The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets 
               kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent 
               Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his 
               mouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.

               A familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the

                         We call them Doobie Snax.

<b>               INT. VAN--WEED VISION

               As Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky 
               (with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze, 
               we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling 
               about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken 
               off to reveal a man inside a costume.

               Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint 
               and look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total 
               debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy 
               cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish 
               and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other. 
               The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--

               The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking 
               way out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-
               eyed.

               Jay and Bob smile and pass out.

               We cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to 
               Weed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.

               Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as 
               well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see 
               the scar. It's not there.

               Bob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points, 
               and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.

               As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public 
               INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.

               Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar 
               and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look 
               at the screen and go wide-eyed.

               Silent Bob finishes typing and presses "Return". He and Jay 
               nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking 
               up at the menu board.

                         and I mean NOTHING--distract me.

               As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and 
               freezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all 
               in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in 
               the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.

               She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.

               Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then 
               at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's 
               eyes, getting zero response.

<b>               JAY'S POV
</b>
               The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to 
               her breasts, then down to her crotch.

               Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle 
               of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss 
               on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager 
               to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous 
               with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.

               But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to 
               Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls 
               his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it 
               over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She 
               smiles at the zombified Jay.

                         Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we 
                         went to see Holden McNeil, and he 
                         showed us the Internet, and that's 
                         where we found all these fucking

                         about us. So we decided to go to

               Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right 
               shoulder.

               They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his 
               hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick, 
               when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder, 
               rubbing a swollen jaw.

                         piece of woman, are you?

               Jay thinks, then nods "Yes." The Jay Angel rolls his eyes, 
               and slaps him.

                         whip your dick out.

               Jay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in 
               his pants to Jay and shakes his head "no," sternly. Jay 
               withdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods, 
               satisfied.

                         The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice 
                         looks at Jay, a bit confused.

               Jay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.

               He winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the 
               can, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and 
               winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly, 
               then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.

               head toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent

               Justice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study 
               the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a 
               place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one.

               Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures

               Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a 
               digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four

               Justice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed 
               closely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one 
               last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay

               Jay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.

               It's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking 
               ANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his

               Silent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade 
               through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on 
               the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.

               Silent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat. The 
               pair look through the cages, until HEAR the distinct SOUND 
               OF A MONKEY. Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage

<b>               INT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT
</b>
               The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the 
               other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.

               Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays 
               the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor, 
               which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly, 
               within the mist, laser beams become apparent.

               Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few 
               steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs 
               forward and does an impressive series of flips down the 
               hallway, not touching a single laser beam.

               Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

               Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of 
               the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture 
               to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series 
               of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.

               Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

               Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to 
               Chrissy.

               Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, 
               Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.

               Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are 
               even more impressive than the other two, including running 
               up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes 
               the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, 
               arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud, 
               manly FART.

               The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING 
               through the building.

               them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed

                         how about taking a shower?

               Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace. 
               They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY 
               GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.

               Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's 
               a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded

               Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The

               Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between 
               them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed 
               up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the 
               diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face.  
               It's a pretty piss-poor disguise.

               GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now 
               in full panic mode.

               Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing.

               Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets.

                         and Matt Damon are on the lot, 
                         shooting a super-secret project.

                         buying a soda at a concession stand 
                         earlier.

                         murky videotape, so no one's even a 
                         hundred percent sure what Jay and 
                         Silent Bob look like, exactly. For 
                         all we know, they could already be 
                         on the lot.

               As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her, 
               looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera 
               and start waving behind Jules.

               The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table.

               Justice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks

               Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity.  
               Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As

               Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there

               The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main 
               gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's 
               just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then 
               lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob.

               Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard 
               booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle 
               and giving chase.

               Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like 
               an open alley then smash into it, falling down. The open 
               alley is a background painting that's being moved by some 
               SCENICS. Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact.

               The SECURITY GUARD catches up to them now, grabbing them by

               Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees,

               Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and 
               jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling 
               away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse. 
               Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.

               Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the 
               vehicle, taking flight,

               Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as--

               Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front 
               basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a 
               soundstage) a la E.T.

               Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then 
               they look ahead and let out a scream.

               The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage 
               Building.

               The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling 
               onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see.

               Jay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide-
               eyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied 
               and beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward,

               Suddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit 
               the deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the 
               arch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking

               Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls. 
               Jay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a 
               vibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button 
               on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a

               Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--

               A wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the 
               placard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE. 
               It's out of his reach.

               Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his 
               hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.

               Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip. 
               The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive 
               pose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair

               ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He 
               lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-
               Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on

               he's attacked.

               Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.

                         You are not upstaging me, Van Der 
                         Beek!

               Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker, 
               hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear 
               reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade 
               the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other 
               hand.

               On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's 
               huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).

               Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber, 
               Jay grins at Cock-Knocker.

               first on Jay, then Bob.

               Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.

               Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on 
               the ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and 
               running for cover.

               Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.

               Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed 
               craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start 
               firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren 
               craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented 
               can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are 
               out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and 
               reload. From behind his table,

               and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.

                         isn't going to stop that!

               In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the 
               air.

                         We ain't leaving empty-handed!

               On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.

               Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.

               Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing 
               each other.

               Justice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.

               Sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop 
               Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out.

               Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.

               a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind 
               him, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her 
               handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.

               She walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes 
               to the door.

               Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him 
               outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front 
               lawn.

               Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers. 
               They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the

               Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him, 
               while Hooper tries to break them up.

               WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a 
               prison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.

<b>               CODA
</b>
               Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3 
               million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial 
               failure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly 
               drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat 
               boards, and over the course of the next year, while they 
               waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay 
               and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out 
               of them.
