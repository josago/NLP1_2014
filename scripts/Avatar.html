          the crowd. A MAN    on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with.
          Hard. She cowers    but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his

</b>          Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans
          down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS.

          the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding.

          advanced technology.
<b>          
</b>          Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and
          heavily armed, they are AT-99 "SCORPION" GUNSHIPS.
<b>          
</b>          MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4

<b>

          of feet high.   A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS
          light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off
          the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege.

          through the tunnel below.
<b>          
</b>          The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long
          parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked
          across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem
          hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars.

</b>                    I was in First Recon a few years ahead of
                    you. More than a few. Two tours in

                    But you know what? I kinda like it.

</b>          Quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit,
          throwing some switches. The `suit's gas-turbine spools up
          with a rising WHINE.

<b>

          power. The air boils above the exhaust vents.

          huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic --

                    I need you to learn about these savages,
                    gain their trust. Find out how I can
                    force their cooperation, or hit `em hard
                    if they don't. Maybe you can keep some

</b>          He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping
          the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing
          a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control.
          He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind
          of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.

</b>          The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the

          the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it.
<b>          
</b>          A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.
<b>          
</b>          The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing,
          leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the
          trail.
<b>          
</b>          Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES.
          Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black
          SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.
<b>          
</b>          He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead.   Another on
          his opposite flank.
<b>          
</b>          Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.
<b>          
</b>          The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey.
          They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                       37.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a
          steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it
          on a horizontal trunk --
<b>          
</b>          -- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates
          GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The
          viperwolves have him encircled.
<b>          
</b>          The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each
          other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on
          his legs from behind but --
<b>          
</b>          JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face.   It yips and goes
          past, but ANOTHER moves in --
<b>          
</b>          He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,
          retreating, baring its fangs.
<b>          
</b>          Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees
          what he's up against.   The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with
          shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.
          Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
<b>          
</b>          Jake realizes that he is making his final stand.   He whirls
          the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --
<b>          
</b>          And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a
          lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE
</b><b>                        (SCREAMING)
</b>                    I don't have all goddamn night! Come on!
                    Come on!
<b>          
</b>          With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.
<b>          
</b>          Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --
<b>          
</b>          ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking
          true, but --
<b>          
</b>          Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes
          flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
<b>          
</b>          A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in
          pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --
<b>          
</b>          CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.
<b>          
</b>          JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf
          leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake
          tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                       38.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          THREE WOLVES charge at once.     The nearest LEAPS at his throat
          just as --
<b>          
</b>          THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.
<b>          
</b>          The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight.    He pushes it
          off in time to see --
<b>          
</b>          A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw
          and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another
          wolf falls.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the
          skull of a circling wolf.
<b>          
</b>          ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but
          rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
<b>          
</b>          Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
<b>          
</b>          SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,
          but --
<b>          
</b>          It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its
          throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.
<b>          
</b>          MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT
          across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.
<b>          
</b><b>                              NEYTIRI
</b>                    Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
<b>          
</b>          The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past
          them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and--
<b>          
</b>          They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--
<b>          
</b><b>                                 NEYTIRI
</b>                    Raaaarrrr!
<b>          
</b>          Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his
          weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it
          and looks up at --
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening
          to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is
          over, she turns.
<b>          
</b>          She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.
          Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE

</b><b>                                                                       39.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still
          see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest
          is transformed.
<b>          
</b>          The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and
          patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.
<b>          
</b>          Jake scrambles to recover his spear.   Neytiri kneels beside --
<b>          
</b>          A DYING WOLF. It's CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,
          trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its
          chest.
<b>          
</b><b>                              NEYTIRI

                    Forgive me, my brother.
<b>          
</b>          She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches
          its head gently, regarding it with sadness.
<b>          
</b>          Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her
          waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling
          the arrow from its heart.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE

                    understand this. But -- thanks. Thank
                    you. I owe you.
<b>          
</b>          Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead
          animal.
<b>

                    come along --
<b>          
</b>          She rises and walks away without looking at Jake.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE
</b>                    Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'?
<b>          
</b>          He crashes through some plants, catching up to her.

</b><b>                              JAKE

                    to thank you for killing those --
<b>          
</b>          He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>

          fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.
<b>          
</b>          He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who
          speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.
<b>          
</b><b>                              NEYTIRI
</b>                    Don't thank! You don't thank for this!
                    This is sad. Very sad, only.
<b>

                    sorry.

</b><b>                              JAKE

<b>                    HERE--
</b><b>          
</b>          She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
<b>          
</b><b>                              NEYTIRI
</b>                    Your fault! You are like a baby, making
                    noise, don't know what to do. You should
                    not come here, all of you! You only come
                    and make problems. Only.
<b>          
</b>          Jake gets up, slowly, facing her.

<b>          
</b>          CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes
          MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big
          gold orbs.
<b>          
</b><b>                              NEYTIRI

<b>          
</b>          She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her.
<b>          
</b>          TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT.
<b>          
</b>          WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which
          forms an elevated walkway.
<b>          
</b>          Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far
          above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move
          through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE
</b>                    If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should
                    teach me.

                    See.
<b>          
</b>          She leaps to another elevated root.   Jake follows, surprised
          that he made it.
<b>          
</b><b>                               JAKE

</b>          He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.

</b><b>                              JAKE
</b>                    Then teach me to "see."

</b>          She stops and he almost runs into her.

</b>          Then she turns and trots on.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. GORGE - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a
          horizontal trunk big as an oak.
<b>          
</b>          WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers
          silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred
          feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other
          night flyers.

<b>          
</b>          A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance.   He drops
          the spear and almost falls off the root.

</b>          Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He
          watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.
<b>          
</b>          She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na'vi.

</b>          DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down
          through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently
          toward Jake and Neytiri.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --
<b>          
</b>          The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards
          Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head.

</b>          More woodsprites gather around him.   Several ALIGHT on him.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to

<b>          
</b>          Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light
          of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical
          gallery -- a living cathedral.

          to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as --

</b>          A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber.

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT./EXT. HOMETREE - BANSHEE EYRIE
</b><b>          
</b>          LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the
          ground. Villagers are ant-like.
<b>          
</b>          Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core
          trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out
          of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --
<b>          
</b>          A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see
          other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like
          enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of
          STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES
          clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.
<b>          
</b>          Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the
          shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.
<b>          
</b>          A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest
          banshees, this thing is taller than a Na'vi with a 10 meter
          wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it
          alights on the branch right in front of her.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 JAKE
</b>                    Holy shit.

</b><b>                              NEYTIRI
</b>                    Do not look in her eye.
<b>          
</b>          Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and
          gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.
<b>          
</b>          It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the
          shadows nearby answer.
<b>          
</b>          Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the
          Banshee's ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the
          neural connection is made.
<b>          
</b><b>                              NEYTIRI

                    made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
                    in the whole life.
<b>          
</b>          She climbs smoothly onto the animal's back.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                       61.

                    choose your own ikran. And he must choose
                    you.

</b><b>                              NEYTIRI
</b>                    When you are ready.
<b>          
</b>          The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 NEYTIRI
</b>                    Heeyaaahh!
<b>          
</b>          Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee
          DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest
          canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a
          power climb.
<b>          
</b>          Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close
          SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.
<b>          
</b>          ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount,
          the rainforest rolling beneath her.
<b>                                                                  CUT TO:

                    The days are starting to blur together.

</b><b>          THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:

</b>                    Ontu, mikyun, nari.
<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he
          draws a longbow.
<b>          
</b>          BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the
          elbow, repositioning him roughly.

</b>                    Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard.
<b>          
</b>          HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --
<b>          
</b>          TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm's bunk. Norm blushes
          and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE (V.O.)
</b>                    Norm's attitude has improved lately.
<b>          
</b>          NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.

</b>                    It's good he's back on board, but he
                    thinks I'm a retard too.
<b>          
</b>          TRACKING WITH JAKE'S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto
          a thick root, running on across the rough bark.
<b>

</b>          Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are
          running 30 meters above the ground.
<b>          
</b>          He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.
          She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE (V.O.)
</b>                    I have to trust my body to know what to
                    do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die.
<b>          
</b>          Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --
<b>          
</b>          She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows
          its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and
          catches another.
<b>          
</b>          JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with
          him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic
          rush.
<b>          
</b>          He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a
          game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive.
<b>          
</b>          Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.   That he lived.
<b>          
</b>          TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at
          the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.
<b>          
</b>          IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO'AT. The
          Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.
          Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE (V.O.)
</b>                    I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and
                    Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes
                    me coffee before link every morning.
<b>          
</b>          Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward
          moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of
          greeting.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out
          the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the
          plants around her, and sniffs the air.
<b>

</b>                    I'm learning to read the trails, the
                    tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest
                    scents and sounds.
<b>          
</b>          JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --
<b>          
</b>          A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows
          of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are
          sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.
<b>          
</b>          One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes
          flight, an explosion of purple wings.
<b>          
</b>          Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.
<b>          
</b>          ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her
          ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are
          closed. She speaks very softly to Jake --
<b>          
</b><b>                              NEYTIRI
</b>                    When you hear nothing, you will hear
                    everything. When you see nothing, you
                    will See everything.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JAKE (V.O.)
</b>                    Sometimes I have no idea what she's
                    talking about.
<b>          
</b>          Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male
          HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
<b>          
</b>          Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri
          watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a
          beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery.
<b>

</b>          A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk
          around her legs. She licks their faces.

<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by
          galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move
          gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.
<b>          
</b>          CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night
          forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.
<b>          
</b>          NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing
          from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom
          of a pool.
<b>          
</b>          A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.      ZAP!
          Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.
<b>          
</b>          ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting
          his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are
          GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
<b>          
</b>          Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken.   Their eyes meet,
          and she pulls away quickly.
<b>          
</b>          NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.
          Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature
          on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING
          perched on a frond. As he approaches --
<b>          
</b>          SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a
          bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening
          like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
<b>          
</b>          THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>

</b>          TSU'TEY signals a stop.
<b>          
</b>          UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like
          trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in
          their gnarled grip.
<b>          
</b>          A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the
          twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural
          occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the
          clouds.
<b>          
</b>          There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and
          the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at --
<b>          
</b>          One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a
          nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is

          the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium
          BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.
<b>          
</b>          JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of
          a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs
          over it -- it floats upward.
<b>          
</b>          They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them,
          the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from
          one of the waterfalls hits them.
<b>          
</b>          Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper
          branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.

</b>          One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.
<b>          
</b>          Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling

          -- a view from Olympus.
<b>          
</b>          A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S
          BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She
          dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven
          HOOD. It waits, docile, as --
<b>

</b>          The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out-
          croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls
          with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.

          it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO.

</b>          Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then
          slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.
<b>          
</b>          Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong
          whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED
          SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but --

          pissed off now, but --

</b>          Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his
          leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN

          pinning it and --

          the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --

          are locked together, literally eye to eye.

<b>          
</b>          It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left"
          and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy
          loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath.
<b>

          banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while
          Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.

          -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
<b>

</b>          Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRI'S lithe shape runs through
          the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes
          Jake by the hand and pulls him up --

          the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger.

</b>          The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of
          dancers.

</b>          Jake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting.
<b>          
</b>          JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets
          himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal
          energy.
<b>          
</b>          GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so
          repressed, who lives within her.

          which seems to stare down at him.

                    fourth connections to the trees around
                    it, and there are ten to the twelfth
                    trees on Pandora --

</b>          A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare
          like birds of prey.

</b>          CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as
          he leads the charge and --

</b>          SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like

</b>          K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around
          the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE
          can barely hang onto the gyrating creature.
<b>          
</b>          The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into
          his canopy.   Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a
          CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees.
          There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with
          cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.

          SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
<b>          
</b>          A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to-
          air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
<b>          
</b>          WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and
          dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns
          and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of
          smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.

</b>          SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but --
<b>          
</b>          HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It
          launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving.
          The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the
          shock wave.
<b>          
</b>          THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons
          Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot
          rolled up on their sides and --

</b>          THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but --
<b>          
</b>          A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson
          demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and --
<b>          
</b>          K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it
          downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
          and teeth as they fall together out of control.
<b>          
</b>          Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick,
          breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
<b>          
</b>          FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it.
          This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a
          breathing mask. The door gunners wave at --
<b>          
</b>          TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the
          cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship
          with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.
<b>          
</b>          The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.

<b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind
          her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the
          trees, under the canopy.
<b>          
</b>          They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang
          half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around
          Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
<b>          
</b>          THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot
          follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse
          of blue-skinned figures.
<b>          
</b>          THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT
          backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor.
<b>          KABOOM!!
</b><b>          
</b>          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a

<b>          
</b>          TSU'TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall
          in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but --
<b>          
</b>          A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as --
<b>          
</b>          TSU'TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink
          and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.
<b>          
</b>          GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
          the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
<b>          
</b>          TSU'TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His

</b>          A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching
          at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
<b>          
</b>          NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest
          floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s
          rip the forest to shreds.

          pain of death.
<b>

</b>          LYLE WAINFLEET reaches down and grabs Tsu'tey by his queue,
          lifting him painfully.

</b>          WAINFLEET cuts Tsu'tey's queue off near the base. TSU'TEY
          SCREAMS in agony, his nervous system exploding on overload.
          Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue -- Tsu'tey's only
          connection to the world-consciousness which is his life.
