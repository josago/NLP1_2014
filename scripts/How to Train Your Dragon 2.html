           Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads...                         

                         

<b>           EXT. BERK - DAY
</b>
           (Sequence 0200 - New Berk)
           To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags
           and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.

<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>           This... is Berk. The best kept
           secret this side of, well,
           anywhere. Granted, it may not look
           like much, but this wet heap of
           rock packs more than a few
           surprises.

          ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as
          shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,
          receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the
          light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!

                         

<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>           Life here is amazing, just not for
           the faint of heart. See, where most
           folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
           or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer
           a little something we like to call--

          WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.
          DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,
          KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck
          between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk.

<b>           DRAGON RACING!
</b>
          It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race.
          Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff
          faces and perched over the sea.

                         
          FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG,
          who carries the sheep in her claws, until...

                         
          SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his
          Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them.

<b>                          SNOTLOUT
</b>           Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you
           want that?

                         

<b>                          FISHLEGS
</b>           Snotlout! That's mine!
          Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on
          their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH.

<b>                          SNOTLOUT
</b>           Here ya go, babe.
          With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut.
          She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE.

<b>                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
</b>           Did I tell you that you look
           amazing today? `Cause you do.

<b>                          RUFFNUT
</b>           Come on, Barf. It's starting to
           stink around here.
          Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout
          with a mugging grin.

<b>                          TUFFNUT
</b>           Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow
           this place, Belch!
          Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and
          leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.
          As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep
          into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap
          crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding
          dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep.
          Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.

<b>                          STOICK
</b>           That's nine for the Twins, Astrid
           lags with three, Fishlegs and
           Snotlout trail with NONE!
          Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard
          painted with an image of Toothless.

                         

<b>                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           found. Hmmm.

<b>                          GOBBER
</b>           Scared him off with the big talk,
           didn't ya, Stoick?
          WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets
          CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY --
          spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite
          herself.

<b>                          ASTRID
</b>           What are you doing, Snotlout?!
           They're going to win now!

<b>                          SNOTLOUT
</b>           She's my princess! Whatever she
           wants, she gets.

<b>                          ASTRID
</b>           Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury
           you alive?!

                         

<b>                          SNOTLOUT
</b>           Only for a few hours!
          BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.

<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>           Dragons used to be a bit of a
           problem here. But that was five
           years ago. Now they've all moved
           in. And, really, why wouldn't they?
          The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and
          into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon
          stables. They exit through the far side and circle back
          through the village, blasting past many of its dragon-
          friendly additions.

<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>           We have custom stables... all-you-
           can-eat feeding stations... a full
           service dragon wash...

                         
          In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting
          one of the Viking houses aflame.

<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>           Even top-of-the-line fire
           prevention, if I do say so myself.
          Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon
          racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of
          aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water.

          BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the
          island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods.

                         

<b>                          STOICK
</b>           It's time, Gobber.

                         

<b>                          GOBBER
</b>           Righty-ho!
           (aloud, to the crowd)
           Last lap!
          A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited.

<b>                          ASTRID
</b>           The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!
           We can still win this thing!

                         

<b>                          RUFFNUT
</b>           Come on, Barf!

                         

<b>                          TUFFNUT
</b>           Let's go!

                         

<b>                          FISHLEGS
</b>           Go, Meatlug!
          GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.

                         

<b>                          GOBBER
</b>           This is your big moment. Have a
           nice flight!

                         
          He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air.
          Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward
          it.

                         

<b>                          ASTRID
</b>           Up, up, up!
          In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the
          sheep.

<b>                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
</b>           No!

<b>                          FISHLEGS
</b>           Good job, Meatlug!
          Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.

<b>                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
</b>           Here you go, darling. Mine's worth
           ten!

<b>                          RUFFNUT
</b>           Yeah! The Black Sheep!
          Snotlout sighs, frustrated.

<b>                          ASTRID
</b>           You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!

<b>                          RUFFNUT
</b>           I'm totally winning!

                         
          Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.

                         

<b>                          FISHLEGS
</b>           We're winning together!
          She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an
          uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their
          dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild.

<b>                          RUFFNUT
</b>           No one can stop me now!

<b>                          TUFFNUT
</b>           Except for me. We're attached,
           genius!

                         
          He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of-
          war.

<b>                          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
</b>           Quit trying to steal all my glory!
          And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward
          them, CLOSING IN.

                         

<b>                          STOICK
</b>           Get `em, Astrid!

</b>          It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining
          glory! EVERYTHING!
          Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck,
          and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.

<b>                          ASTRID
</b>           Gotcha!

                         
          She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly, sticking a perfect
          landing, black sheep in hand.

                         

<b>                          RUFFNUT

          BACK TO STOICK, beside himself. The crowd ROARS.

                         

<b>                          STOICK

           (gloating, to the crowd)
           That's my future daughter-in-law!

<b>          BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY
</b>          eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as...
          FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid
          off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong
          toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid.

<b>                          SNOTLOUT
</b>           Uh, excuse me.

<b>                          ASTRID
</b>           Stormfly!
          Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly
          out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with
          a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the
          water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black
          sheep into their basket!

                         

<b>                          STOICK
</b>           That's thirteen! Astrid takes the
           game!
          The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd,
          basking in her victory.

<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>           Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.
           All of my hard work has paid off.
           And it's a good thing, too, because
           with Vikings on the backs of
           dragons, the world just got a whole
           lot bigger.

                         

<b>          EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY
</b>
          (Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)
          A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK
          SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled
          freedom.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.

                         

                         
          Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of
          TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with
          Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
          refinement, making them seem effortless.

<b>                          HICCUP
</b>           Yeah!
          They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through
          the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks
          as they soar in formation.
          Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight
          suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and
          articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.

                         

<b>                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>           What do you think, bud? Wanna give
           this another shot?

                         
          Toothless grumbles in protest.

                         

<b>                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>           Toothless! It'll be fine.
          With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared
          tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.

                         

<b>                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
</b>           Ready?
          Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.
          Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from
          him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.

                         
          Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-
          to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.
          Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
          flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends
          his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...
          and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then
          stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.
          But he's flying!
          Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.
          The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the
          moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.
          Independently together.
          They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then
          crossing paths again.

          Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle.
          Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him
          higher with the expanding heat bursts.

          Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.
          Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he
          HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering
          difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.

          At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
          ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
          through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.
          Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
          into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the
          uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.
          Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He
          switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
          stows his leather wings.

          Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,
          revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete
          with a Viking braid.
          He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND
          stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-
          stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
          dappled afternoon sunlight.

          Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and
          pebbles like a wet dog.
          Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
          head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.

          Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off
          of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.

          WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground.
          Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully
          retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head.

          Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
          of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,
          lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.

          Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and
          shaking off the viscous saliva.

          Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.

                         
          Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
          before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
          produces a leather-bound book.

                         
          He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added
          strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding
          world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new
          dragons.
          Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his
          flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.
          Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,
          then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
          forearm.

          She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless'
          slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off.

                         
          Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.

          Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through
          undulating crimson and gold forests.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly
          give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and
          wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of
          ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S

          splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction.

          leaving him uneasy.

          at the stern of a moored ship below.

          the last second.

                         
          Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush
          out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She
          whips her tail, sending spikes flying.

          A large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes

          Eret's ship carves a defiant path North, leaving the last
          glimpses of Lapland in its wake.

                         
          Eret stands on the bowsprit, eyeing the waves intently,
          searching the surface. He turns toward the deck, where his
          crewmen man the gunwale cannons, sights trained to the sky.

          bed of clouds, glowing in the low, Arctic sun.
          Hiccup YELLS, then slumps back onto the saddle.
          Toothless recoils, sensitive to Hiccup's upset. The steam
          from their breath mixes in the frigid air.

          Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder
          to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds.
          A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds,
          standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in
          the buffeting turbulence.
          The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside
          them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery
          and sits up, flustered.

          Then, just as gradually as he rose, the warrior dips back
          beneath the clouds, disappearing.

          quick, disarming gesture, the warrior lays Toothless down in
          a state of bliss. Hiccup is astounded.

                         
          The warrior's hand continues toward Hiccup's face. He
          recoils, but the warrior persists, finding the faint scar on
          Hiccup's chin, glinting in the firelight.

                         
          The warrior GASPS and retreats a few steps.

          Valka rushes in, panicked.

           house, finding you in the cradle.

                         
          Valka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only
          to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY
          HICCUP innocently plays with one of its talons.

          Valka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak.
          Spooked, Cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally
          SCRATCHING baby Hiccup's chin.

                         
          Their eyes meet. Valka lowers her sword, transfixed.

          Stoick's AXE spins through the air between them, barely
          missing Cloudjumper and planting into a pillar.

          Stoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the
          wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze.

          Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a
          majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun.

                         
          Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of
          dragons -- nearly all of Valka's rescues -- are close on
          their tail. He turns back to his mother, confused.

                         

<b>                          HICCUP

           eat?

           Oh, we are.

                         
          She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the
          fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense
          shoal of fish near the surface.

                         
          Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping
          the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface.
          It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a
          fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing
          back down into the sea.

                         
          Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race
          for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air. Hiccup
          gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a
          mouth full.

          Hiccup has his map spread out in the snow, explaining the
          various lands he's discovered during his explorations.

          He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but
          she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in
          the snow, wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has
          explored.

          She returned to Hiccup's side with a smile. But his amazement
          is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over
          Valka's map with a giant icicle.

                         
          Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper
          sneers.

          Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a
          strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff.

                         
          One by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong
          updraft, popping their wings open like kites. They ride the
          wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric
          dance. It's clearly a form of dragon play.

                         
          Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind,
          laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's
          wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to
          another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip
          to wing tip. She then drops out of sight, reappearing a
          moment later standing atop Cloudjumper. Hiccup is in utter
          awe of her.

                         
          Valka breathes in the frigid air. Lets it out blissfully.

           Hiccup.

                         
          Hiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and
          unbuckles himself. Valka watches, curious.

          marvelling, as...

                         
          ... Hiccup SOARS, riding the wild air currents like an eagle,
          the image of freedom. Toothless descends steadily with him,
          hovering protectively.

                         
          Hiccup grins, pleased at having impressed Valka... until he
          realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with
          a fast approaching mountain top.

          But, with his tail locked, Toothless can't make the tight
          jackknife turn skyward to rescue Hiccup.

                         
          Realizing that they're in trouble, Valka and Cloudjumper pour
          on the speed. All four of them collide just as they reach the
          mountain top, sending them crash-landing in an explosion of
          snow.

                         
          They all TOPPLE head over tail to a messy landing on the wind-
          swept ridge and pop up LAUGHING.

          Toothless raises his snow-packed face, glowering. He tail-
          swipes Hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder.

                         
          Valka inspects Hiccup's wing suit with utter fascination.

          She caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. Hiccup
          doesn't recoil this time.

          Valka finds a spot at the top of Toothless' neck and rubs in
          a circular pattern. In response, his dorsal blades slowly
          crack, split and extend, forming a pronounced, aerodynamic
          `V' down the length of his back and tail.

          Toothless shudders, as if experiencing a much-needed
          chiropractic adjustment. He bounds over to Hiccup, giddily
          retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a
          new toy.

          She pulls him into a hug -- forceful, bursting with emotion.
          Hiccup hugs Valka back. They share a cathartic moment, before
          Hiccup peels away from her.

          Hiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. Cloudjumper
          lumbers over, eager to be rid of Toothless' puppy-like
          energy. Valka pets him.

          Before Hiccup can say anymore, he hear heavy breathing next
          to him, and looks over to see Toothless with a gaping grin,

          by armored dragons.

          The soldiers disarm him, pushing him forward as Drago
          approaches.

</b>           Well, as you can see, I'm right on
           time with a new batch of dragons,
           just like I promised.

                         
          Hookfang awakens, groggily shaking off the effect of the blow-
          dart. He rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in.

          They do so. Hookfang bucks and roars, chasing off the
          soldiers, then focusing on Drago as he closes in. The armored
          dragons avert their eyes and cower as Drago passes.

                         
          Hookfang HISSES a warning, but Drago approaches, undaunted.

                         
          Hookfang BLASTS. In a blur, Drago wraps himself in his dragon
          skin cloak. The sticky, napalm-like fire splatters against
          the fireproof scales, enveloping Drago in dripping flames as
          he persists forward without missing a step.

                         
          As the blast ends, Drago drops the cloak, closing in and
          holding a cold stare. Hookfang lets out a ferocious ROAR.

                         
          Drago YELLS back with a fierce, savage scream, interrupting
          Hookfang and causing him to recoil. Drago whirls his bull-
          hook overhead and STABS it into the deck planks.

                         
          Hookfang stirs, his aggression fading in the face of Drago's
          unflinching show of dominance.

                         
          After a moment, Hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head
          in submission. Drago places his boot upon Hookfang's snout,
          pressing it into the deck planks.

          Drago notices the saddle on Hookfang's back. His eyes wander
          to the saddle on Meatlug. Alarm flashes in Drago's eyes.

          a clatter.

                         
          Valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him, blocking the
          path. She lets out an audible SHUDDER upon seeing him.

                         
          He removes his helmet slowly as Hiccup, Gobber, and Toothless
          appear at Stoick's side.

          Stoick steps towards her, wide-eyed and speechless. Dragons
          emerge from the recesses behind Valka, hissing protectively.

          step, Valka becomes increasingly flustered. She backs into an
          ice wall, with nowhere to go, and Stoick just a few paces
          away.

          His words snuff her retort, rendering her speechless. She
          softens despite herself, yielding her cheek to his palm. He
          caresses her skin as a reluctant tear runs through his
          fingers. He PULLS her into a KISS. She resists briefly, then

          He catches one of their spears with his bound hands and

          Stoick scowls at him, then returns his attention to Valka.

          Stoick pauses, setting Valka up for her part of the duet.

          Stoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but Valka closes
          her eyes, rejecting his invitation. He lets out a heavy-
          hearted sigh. But nostalgia gets the better of Valka. She
          softly SINGS HER PART:

          Stoick beams. She brushes past him, setting into the center
          of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation.
          Stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a
          beautiful dance to accompany the song.

          The dance is full of charming missteps as Stoick and Valka
          recreate a moment from their past, before Hiccup's wonder-
          struck eyes.

          Gobber can't help himself. He drags Hiccup onto his feet so
          that he can join in the dancing, too.

          Hiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning
          and laughing in each others' arms, reunited.

          Astrid glares, both relieved and annoyed to see Hiccup.

          and Eret look up to see...

                         
          VALKA, in full warrior garb, rising from the towering ice
          spikes, atop Cloudjumper.

          An earth-trembling roar follows as the Bewilderbeast rises
          behind Valka.

          ON DRAGO, gawking in awe as the great BEWILDERBEAST BLASTS
          an epic explosion of ice upon the attackers.

          Valka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of
          dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of
          Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon
          wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and
          destroying war machines.

                         
          One of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup
          and Toothless double-back for a rescue.

          Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a
          plasma bolt, freeing the dragon.

          BACK TO VALKA, on Cloudjumper as they pry Drago's armored
          dragons off of the flailing wild ones. A net suddenly
          envelops Cloudjumper. They CRASH heavily, but Valka cuts
          herself free, sliding to a stop just paces away from Drago.

          Drago cocks his bull hook, ready to strike, but Valka
          deflects Drago's hit and attacks him.

          He turns to the flagship and YELLS savagely, whirling his
          bullhook overhead.

                         
          The heavy chains are released. The underwater creature, now
          freed, breaks the surface in an epic cascade of seawater. It
          rises toward the shoreline, revealing itself to be...

                         
          A SECOND BEWILDERBEAST -- bigger, meaner, and covered in
          scars that indicate years of training and abuse. The chains
          fall away from iron cuffs fastened to its massive tusks.

          Valka attacks Drago with her bullhook, trying to stop his
          commands, but Drago strikes back, knocking her forcefully
          onto her back. He pins her as she struggles, removing her
          mask and staff. He's about to finish her off, when WHAM! He's
          knocked to the ground. He looks up, fuming, to see Stoick
          helping Valka to her feet.

          As Drago gathers his weapon and drops his heavy cloak,
          circling Stoick, Drago's Bewilderbeast confronts Valka's in a
          threat display.

          Valka cuts the nets away and hops onto Cloudjumper, flying
          off toward the Bewilderbeasts as they charge each other,

          But, with a devastating SWIPE, DRAGO's Bewilderbeast takes
          down Valka's, plunging in its tusks and burying its

          With his tail impaired, Cloudjumper struggles against a
          throng of oncoming dragons. Valka is knocked off, but manages
          to cling to her dragon's neck.
          As she loses her grip and FALLS...

                         
          Stoick LEAPS from Skullcrusher and CATCHES Valka. He sinks
          his axe into an icy column, and they slide to a safe landing.
          Drago's Bewilderbeast presses closer, sniffing them out.

          HISSES, forcing Toothless to cower under a hypnotic
          ultrasonic broadcast. Toothless struggles against the alpha's

          robotic, as his pupils turn to slits.

                         
          Drago then points to Hiccup. The Bewilderbeast responds,
          HISSING again at Toothless.

          Grump lands ON TOP of Gobber, flattening him.

                         
          Relieved to the point of tears, Snotlout and Fishlegs race
          towards the expectant Ruffnut...

          Ruffnut GRUMBLES, dejected. Barf dips his head in to console
          her.

                         

<b>                          RUFFNUT
</b>           Oh Barf!

                         
          She hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut
          pushes him away...

                         

<b>                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

          And into Tuffnut who glowers back at her.

                         
          Hiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. Skullcrusher
          approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. Hiccup pets
          him, as Eret approaches.

                         

<b>                          ERET
</b>           That was some pretty fine dragon
           wrangling back there. You'd make a
           good trapper.

                         
          Before Hiccup can respond, Skullcrusher nuzzles Eret
          affectionately. Eret chuckles and gently strokes him.

                         

<b>                          HICCUP

           somebody to look after him now.

<b>                          ERET
</b>           Me?

                         
          Hiccup nods reassuringly. Eret looks at Skullcrusher, pausing
          to consider it.

                         

<b>                          ERET (CONT'D)

          Valka walks up to her son, bursting with pride.

<b>                          HICCUP

           here, Mom.

                         

<b>                          VALKA
</b>           And here I'll stay.

                         
          Toothless arrives, purring at Valka's touch as Astrid strides
          toward Hiccup, beaming proudly.

                         

<b>                          ASTRID

          She places her hand upon his chest, then quickly pokes the
          dorsal fin button, popping it open. She GIGGLES.

                         

<b>                          HICCUP

           That's hilarious.

          He scoops Astrid close and pulls her into a kiss. Gobber
          covers a gawking boy's eyes.

                         

<b>                          GOBBER
</b>           Ooh.

                         
          Gothi, the elder, taps Hiccup's shoulder, interrupting the
          romantic moment. She gestures for Hiccup to kneel. He does
          so, respectfully.

                         
          Using ash from a heap of burnt wreckage, Gothi traces a
          Viking symbol onto Hiccup's forehead. She bows.

                         
          Hiccup stands, meeting Gobber's proud, smiling eyes. Gobber
          turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms.

<b>                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
</b>           The chief has come home!

                         
          The Berkians erupt with cheers and applause as Hiccup takes
          in the moment, acknowledging the weight of responsibility now
          upon him.

                         
          Toothless throws back his head and BLASTS in celebration,
          spurring all other dragons to follow suit, lighting up the
          sky in a spectacular display.

          A sheep grazes lazily on the grass as a Terrible Terror
          struggles in vain to carry him off. Suddenly, both are
          snatched up by a passing dragon.

          Ruffnut and Tuffnut wrestle over the sheep atop Barf & Belch.
          Ruffnut send the sheep flying toward Fishlegs. Snotlout nabs
          it instead, blowing a kiss mockingly.

                         

<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)
</b>           This... is Berk. A bit trampled and
           busted and covered in ice, but it's
           home. It's our home.

                         
          They swoop past a gathered crowd on the battered bleachers as
          Snotlout dunks the sheep in his basket. Eret joins the race
          atop Skullcrusher.

                         
          They fly past Hiccup and Toothless, who are steadily hoisting
          a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where workers
          are rebuilding the damaged houses.

                         
          Hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of
          Stoick, presently under construction. He grins with pride.

                         

<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)

          He looks to the horizon, scanning it from east to west to
          ensure that no trouble is approaching.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly buzz past him playfully, coaxing him to
          join the game. He smiles.

          Astrid soars past the blacksmith stall, waving to Valka and
          Gobber as they remove the armor from Drago's freed battle
          dragons.

          Realizing that he's late, Gobber hurries over to the sheep
          launcher and pulls the trigger, sending the black sheep
          hurtling into the air.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly close in on the black sheep, about to
          snatch it out of the air, when suddenly, Hiccup and Toothless
          dart past, beating them to it. Toothless looks back with a
          gummy smile.

          Toothless and Hiccup dive toward the line of baskets. As they
          approach, Toothless bounces Hiccup into the air, allowing him
          to dunk the black sheep into Astrid's basket. They reunite on
          the other side. The crowd cheers!
