          The door opens. And Eddie is taken aback. Vern has been
          beaten up. Really worked over. His lip is split, his face
          puffy and bruised. His right hand is bandaged.

          Leaving the door open, Vern turns around and motions at Eddie
          with his left hand to come in. The place is all mismatched
          antique furniture -- the possessions of someone who collected
          once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell.
          Vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated.

          The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that

          Eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly
          can.
                         
          He still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He
          can't run fast.
                         
          Tan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps
          on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling.

          bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it --
          then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it.

          waisted, short-haired brunette middle-aged woman, wearing a
          large, shapeless sweater. Eddie had looked right at her...

          In a flash, he's on the ice after Lindy, running and sliding.

          Lindy wheels around, grabs a SIX YEAR OLD GIRL under the

          Coat as hard she can! The little girl's skates arc through
          the air --whoosh! -and connect, CUTTING Tan Coat's FACE.
          Badly.
                         
          He sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood.
          People scream and scatter. Lindy keeps her wits about her.
          She runs, sliding across the ice, and leaping the fence, with
          surprising grace. She's gone.

           felt thick, stupid, tired. A small
           pain was starting behind my eyes.
           I'd been unable to take my MDT, and
           I was overdue.

          He shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd.
          In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in
          his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye
          that Eddie doesn't recognize.

</b>           You want to push that button? I'll
           show you my silos if you show me
           yours.
                         
<b>                          STEADMAN
</b>           You'll run out. You'll die.
                         
<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           Or I'll think of something. Isn't
           that what MDT does? Makes you
           think of something? Might even
           tell me how to get off it.
                         
          A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.
                         
<b>                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>           What if I just ask the drug... how
           to tell the drug... how to fuck
           itself? I mean, isn't it like the
           8-ball?
                         
          Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls
          away.

          As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales.
                         
          And only then do we see it.
                         
          He's scared.
                         
<b>                          THE END
