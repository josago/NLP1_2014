<b>                             VOICE (O.S.)
</b>               Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose
               of this meeting is to determine
               whether, if released, you are
               likely to break the law again.
               While this was your first
               conviction, you have been
               implicated, though never charged,
               in over a dozen other confidence
               schemes and frauds. What can you
               tell us about this?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>               As you say, ma'am, I was never
               charged.


<b>2   INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING         2

    Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a
    table.

<b>                             BOARD MEMBER #2
</b>               Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to
               find out is: was there a reason
               you chose to commit this crime, or
               was there a reason why you simply
               got caught this time?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>               My wife left me. I was upset.    I
               got into a self-destructive
               pattern.

<b>                               BOARD MEMBER #3
</b>                 If released, is it likely you
                 would fall back into a similar
                 pattern?

<b>                               DANNY
</b>                 She already left me once. I don't
                 think she'll do it again just for
                 kicks.

    Glances dart between the Board Members.

<b>                               BOARD MEMBER #1

                 would do if released?

    Danny considers.

    Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions
    and a form certifying their return to Danny.

    within, he smirks just a little.

</b>
     Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare
     thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The
     old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver
     wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?


<b>5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5
</b>
     A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY
     CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it:
     "If you were in prison, you'd be home now."

     The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its
     frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you
     notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)

     He hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of
     freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of
     the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New
     Jersey):    Life is hard out there.

     But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step
     into free America...

<b>6    INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT                           6
</b>
     ... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red
     carpeting.

     As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we
     hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of
     CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK
     from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS.

     And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair
     and a snifter of brandy. He's home.


<b>     ON DANNY'S WALLET
</b>
     As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on
     green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of
     chips.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             4.

</b>
    Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for
    someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but
    without success. He turns his attention back to his
    cards, and the cards of the dealer.

    Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins.
    King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts.
    Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again.

    A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes
    him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was
    scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar
    face is welcome.

<b>                               DANNY
</b>              Hello, Frank.

    The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and
    his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's
    dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He
    quickly hides his astonishment.

<b>                            FRANK
</b>              I beg your pardon, sir. You must
              have me confused with someone
              else. My name is Ramon. See?

    He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is
    the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit
    boss circles close by and glares at them both.

<b>                            DANNY
</b>              My mistake...
                     (collecting his chips,
                      doubled)
              Table's cold anyway.

<b>                            FRANK
</b>              You might try the lounge at the
              Grand, sir. It gets busy around
              one.

<b>                               DANNY
</b>                        (as he goes)
              Thanks.

    Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around
    him: prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon,
    folds back the New York Times and scans.

    His eyes move down the page and stop at a header --
    "Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces
    Plans" -- accompanied by two photographs...

    The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of
    the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely
    visible) woman on his arm. The second: scowling former
    owner, Reuben Tishkoff.

    Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him,
    changed out of his dealer's threads.

                 And already turning over a new
                 leaf.

    Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.

    Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye,
    and Danny can't help but grin: of course he has.

                   buy his way out of his bluff.

      Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to
      leave a grand on the table, either. Finally, Seth
      ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.

     actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track
     at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race.

     The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the
     wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote
     control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. Really.
     Peckerwoods, sure, but nice.

               sense they're having trouble
               filling the hours.

     Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK
     COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead.
     It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he
     jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his
     brother's vehicle.

     Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.

     disappears into the tunnel, he moves.

     Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps
     under the box seats. He produces an orange from his
     pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes
     appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but
     doesn't turn around.

     him people are standing and shouting.

     Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and
     walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish

     Saul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of

     One passenger in particular keeps his footing, a young
     man in a frayed jacket: LINUS.

     Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to
     the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and
     consequently they don't notice (and neither do we, not at
     first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets.

     The thievery is glacier-paced: Linus, his face always
     forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his
     target's Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with
     incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with
     a flick of his thumb and forefinger.

     From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss,
     and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems...

     A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld,
     lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus.
     It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is
     aware of the ongoing heist.

     Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight,
     but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when
     the train hits another curve...

     ... he stumbles forward, his left hand finding support on
     the Stockbroker's shoulder as his right relieves the man
     of his wallet.

<b>                                LINUS
</b>                  Sorry 'bout that.

<b>                                STOCKBROKER
</b>                  No problem, guy.

     The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as
     Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face
     betraying nothing. Only Danny appreciates the artistry
     performed here today. He folds the Sun-Times under his
     arm as...

     Commuters zig and zag, this way and that, all on furious
     schedules, and Linus slips blithely through them, in no
     hurry, a man who's pulled this job a thousand times
     before.

     He dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for
     a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the Sun-Times
     tucked under his arm), he escapes the station without
     incident.

     Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count
     his winnings. And his face falls.

     All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a
     calling card. On one side, in engraved printing:
     "DANIEL OCEAN." On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice
     pull. Murphy's Bar, Rush & Division."

     On a tabletop: the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk
     Guinness. Linus enters the front door, cases the joint,
     spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it.

     sits.

<b>                                DANNY
</b>                  Bobby told me about you. Said you

     the table. He keeps his hand over it.

     Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at

     When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet

     Danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the

     Linus trades nods around the room.

                  highly dangerous. If that doesn't
                  sound like your particular brand

     He turns and walks out of the living room, into another.
     Rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye
     over the assembled and keeps going. The guys look each
     other over, sizing things up.

     is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each
     leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator
     shaft which descends into an enormous vault.

                  houses   a security system which
                  rivals   most nuclear missile silos.
                  First:    we have to get within the

                  code changed every twelve hours.
                  Past those lies the elevator, and
                  this is where it gets tricky: the

                  people in. I want you guys to
                  know the quick routes out.

     Their job done, the Malloys start toward the casino's
     exit... in different directions. They begin to argue:
     The exit's that way -- no, it's that way.

     Frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now
     is to force Billy Tim into lowering his price just to get
     Frank out of his office.

                  but now I'm liking this new brand
                  fortified with rose hip. My

                  And that ideally you should be

     A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money
     can buy. As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...

<b>                                SAUL

     Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to

     Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his

     icicles.

     waver.

     Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in
     Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on
     his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge
     of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even
     deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could
     be Scottish, could be Israeli...

</b>               There's a little over twenty grand

     The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry
     of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and
     Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for
     him.

      this is not a man to be denied. As he jumps to it...

      A facsimile of the Bellagio vault sprouts into shape.
      Livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then
      matches its image (of Frank staple-gunning floorboard
      into place) to a security tape of the real McCoy.

      On the other side of the garage, Turk and Virgil go to
      work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and
      blow torches. Tishkoff recognizes a gasket Virgil
      handles.

                Rolls!

      Overlooking the whole enterprise is Danny, grinning from
      ear to ear, happy in his work. He checks a stopwatch in
      his hand as...

      ... the false top to the cash cart before him flies open,
      revealing Yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded
      into a three-by-four foot space. He whips an air hose
      from his mouth and inhales deeply. Danny checks his
      watch.

      Yen responds. Of course, Danny doesn't understand him.
      But Rusty does, appearing behind him.

</b>                But what doesn't beat the shit out

      Danny turns to Rusty:    he looks very, very serious.

      The painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall
      between a van Gogh and a Monet.

      At a distance, admiring it, are Tess, the SELLER and the
      seller's AIDE-DE-CAMP. A staff photographer and other
      personnel mill nearby.

      Off to the side, in a sharp blazer, Tess stands
      transfixed by the painting.

                   to her, and yet she drives him

                   issues with my fight promoter. I
                   gave him an unlimited budget, and

       Quiet, elegant, tense. One table is operating only, in
       the corner, and at it Saul, as Lyman Zerga, furtively
       peels at the roll of Rolaids and slips one in his mouth.

      This shuts the High Roller up fast. Saul looks up from
      the table, just perceptibly, to spot Terry Benedict, on
      his way in, right on schedule. He approaches the PIT
      BOSS by the entrance.

      stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the

      in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her
      man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on

                the best with his future plans for
                the property...

      back at her: Danny's. She holds his glance a moment --
      long enough for both Linus and Benedict to notice --
      before turning away, to...

      up to a podium alongside MIKE TYSON and LENNOX LEWIS, and

      The Bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and
      what we've been watching has been a trial run. Ten of

      From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash

      both hands without touching the floor. From this

      Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to

       Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a
       glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.

<b>                                  BASHER (V.O.)
</b>                    A pinch is the equivalent of a
                    cardiac arrest for any broad-band
                    electrical circuitry. Or better
                    yet: A pinch is a bomb... but
                    without the bomb. Every time a
                    nuclear weapon detonates, it
                    unleashes an electromagnetic pulse
                    which shuts down any power source
                    within its vicinity. That tends
                    not to matter in most cases
                    because the nuclear weapon
                    destroys everything you might need
                    power for anyway. Now a pinch
                    creates a similar electromagnetic
                    pulse, but without the headache of
                    mass destruction and death. So
                    instead of Hiroshima, you get the
                    Seventeenth Century.

      Danny stares daggers at Rusty. But he can see: everyone
      in the room is on Rusty's side. Defeated, he stalks out
      of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down
      Linus.

      Linus's eyes drift to Danny outside -- whatever acrimony

      A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races
      up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait.

      Turk Malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase
      handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the

      Turk extends the briefcase to Saul, so that they both
      clasp the handle, as Virgil produces a key, unlocks the
      cuff on Turk's wrist, transfers it to Saul's, clamps it
      shut, and hands Saul the key.

      either side of him two gorgeous young women, all blonde
      hair and breasts and legs, women who wouldn't give Hefner
      the time of day.

      Benedict hesitates: He's in an enormous hurry now, he's
      behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but
      leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in
      his cage is a security risk. One glace at the cameras
      all about and he decides to risk it.

      There's a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile:
      Danny's about to find out who. One Goon rises to usher
      in...

                   me talking to his girl.

      The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the
      Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those
      gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a
      hole in this man. The Goons head for the door.

      The Goons exit. Danny and the Bruiser face off. And as
      Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser's fist flashes
      out and knocks him down. Danny rises, wiping a little
      blood from his lip.

                    hundred sixty million dollars
                    behind that door. Let's get him
                    out.

       Danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard.

       Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase
       opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's
       "emeralds"). He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he
       knows: it's time for his leap. It's the same distance
       as the leap he made in the practice session, but this
       time he's only got one good hand.

      Yen prepares for his leap, then springs...

      ... across the room, to the ledge he must grab...

      ... and he grabs it, but with only one hand he's slipping
      right away, and in a second he'll hit the sensored
      floor...

      ... but, in a flash, he spins and splits his legs,
      propping himself up between two walls, inches above the
      floor. An acrobatic wonder.

      Danny, oblivious to this close call, slaps the door
      again. A moment passes, then: Yen responds with a slap,
      too.

      Linus punching in the combination he stole from Benedict
      as Danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a
      detonator.

       Yen sets the last of Lyman's emeralds against the vault
       door like a plastic explosive... which, of course, it is.
       He affixes a detonator receiver (the size of a golf ball
       pencil) to it, then slaps the door twice: all set.

       Danny responds with two slaps of his own. He steps
       back, detonator in hand, its wires attached to the vault
       door.

       Yen starts his retreat from the door, but gets yanked
       back.

       His hand's bandage is caught on the door.

       Yen tries to free himself, but he can't use his other
       hand lest he drop to the floor. He tries gnawing at
       his bandage, which brings his face within inches of a
       plastic explosive.

      MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together
      again.

</b>                   Where do you want to go first?

<b>                                   DANNY
</b>                   To a phone.

      Rusty had anticipated this.

<b>                                 RUSTY
</b>                   I stopped and picked up your
                   personal effects, put them in the
                   back seat.

<b>                                   DANNY
</b>                   My what?

      Danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see Tess
      sitting in the back. She smiles at him.

<b>                                 DANNY
</b>                          (smiling back,
                           then)
                   I'm not sure these belong to me.

<b>                                   TESS
</b>                   Sure they do.

      Danny and Rusty get in.      Danny kisses Tess.   Rusty STARTS
      the CAR.

<b>                                 DANNY
</b>                   We need to find Rusty a girl.

<b>                                 RUSTY
</b>                   There's a women's prison just down
                   the road...

      He drives off. In the back, Danny takes Tess's hand in
      his. Notices a silver wedding band on it.

<b>                                 DANNY
</b>                   You said you sold this.

<b>                                 TESS
</b>                   That's what I said.

<b>                                 DANNY
</b>                   Liar.

<b>                                 TESS
</b>                   Thief.

      As they drive away...

      ... another car STARTS its ENGINE begins to follow.   At
      the wheel: Benedict's goons.
