               Bill hits the ground, which is luckily mainly composed of
               MUD. He lies stunned as MORE HELICOPTERS lower around him
               and his PLATOON begin to debark. The Helicopters barely
               touch the ground before they take off again. SUPERED

               Bill gets up onto his knees and examines his M-16 - the
               barrel clogged with earth. He pokes his finger into the
               muzzle trying to clean it, then finds he can't get it
               back out again.

               Ahead of Bill and his Platoon is a WALL OF DEAD AMERICAN

               His men stand staring at the wall aghast. A PRIVATE

                            aimed high, didn't fire at all, or
                            pretended to be busy doing
                            something else.
               Bullets still flying above her head, the Woman stops
               running, crouches down and RETURNS FIRE.
               Bill is SHOT, stumbles backwards and falls into the mud,
               his finger still stuck in his M-16. He lies there,
               staring up at the sky, his expression one of puzzlement,
               as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest.

</b>                            We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen.
                            Vietnam has crushed our soul. We
                            are traumatized and melancholic.
                            We are ashamed. That is why I have
                            brought you to this place of
                            Sanctuary. Here we can mend our
                            wounds and dream our dreams. My
                            dream is of an America that
                            will lead the world to paradise,
                            an America that no longer has an
                            exploitative view of natural
                            resources, that no longer promotes
                            consumption at all costs. I
                            believe this is America's destiny.

               approaching.

               off his scarf and starts to blindfold Lyn with it.

               Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to
               POUND the fallen man with it. The Young Iraqi moves to
               intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle.
               The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the
               door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races
               away over the sand.
               The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his
               victim's flight. When he turns back Lyn has scooped up
               the Insurgent's GUN and is aiming it at him.
               Beat. Nobody moves.

               ...as the two SUV's roar up, horns blaring, M-16's

                Bob wakes up, listening to the sound of Lyn's laboured
                breathing.
                Across the room Lyn sits, sweating with pain, preparing
                an injection. We see he has used the LAST OF THE
                MEDICINE. He injects himself, his breathing beginning to
                ease and sits staring at the empty VIAL. Bob watches for
                a moment then shuts his eyes, feigning sleep.

                Lyn and Bob are waiting on the quiet road which is
                studded with burnt out CARS.
                Mahmud drives an old Renault out of a warehouse and over
                to them. He gets out the car and hands Lyn the keys.

</b>                             There's a story that Wong Wifu,
                             great Chinese martial artist, had
                             a fight with some guy and had him
                             beat when the guy gave him this
                             light tap, and Wong looked at him
                             and the guy just nodded. That was
                             it. He'd given him the death touch
                             and Wong died.

                The same horizon, the dunes now burning under the sun. We
                TRACK back and find Bob and Lyn lying asleep, lips
                cracked, dehydrated, exhausted. Faintly we hear a sound -
                a tinny BELL. It gets closer. Groggily Bob opens his eyes
                just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him,
                the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it
                pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination. He
                struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm he's been
                lying at the foot of.
                The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the
                berm and disappears from sight.
                Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying,
                staring down at something.

                Bob is dragging a barely conscious Lyn up the berm,
                following the goat. He staggers, barely able to put one
                foot in front of the other.
                At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves
                looking down on a WATER-HOLE, fringed with palms. The
                goat stands drinking. It stops to look up at us.

                eating dinner with Bob's ex-Editor - Dave.

                          radio stations, the TV stations,
                          because that was what Lyn wanted
                          me to do. The people needed to
                          know.

                          would do to me. I was ready to
                          disappear. I was ready to go to
                          prison. I was a Jedi and I was
                          fighting for the New Earth Army.

                             prisoners are being forced to
                             listen to Barney the Purple

                             of my story that ran anywhere. And
                             it was a joke. And if I ever
                             needed proof of how the Dark Side
                             have taken the beautiful dream of
                             what a nation could be and had
                             twisted it, destroyed it, that was
                             it.
