<b>FADE IN:
</b><b>EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)
</b>Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar of
steam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark
place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.
We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable
suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the
surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run
for Congress some day.  At first glance.
Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution
style. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling
in a strawberry field.
<b>                       JAKE (V.O.)
</b>           And I think it's because of this
           redhead...
<b>                       BUTCH (O.S.)
</b>           Know who I am, Jake?
<b>                       JAKE
</b>           The Anti-Christ?
<b>                       BUTCH (O.S.)
</b>           No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the
           Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy
           looking for some answers.
There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being
cocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's
ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull.
The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his
suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a
"Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch".
                       BUTCH (cont' d)
           Things are probably going to end badly
           for you, Jake.
<b>                       JAKE
</b>           Gee... What makes you say that?
<b>                       BUTCH
</b>           Your life flashing before your eyes?
<b>                       JAKE
</b>           Just the last three weeks.

</b><b>EXT . - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT
</b>Title: Three Weeks Ago...
The same alley... The door of a building bursts open as
LIONEL DOLBY (late 40's), dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles
out breathing heavy. The dim light of a bare bulb glares
off the sweat on his forehead.
A moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying
a large black revolver.
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             I lost my head. I'm... Sorry.    I don't
             know what happened.
<b>                         LIONEL
</b>             Y-y-you fucking shot him!   That's what
             happened!
<b>                        JAKE
</b>             I had to! That motherfucker was about
             to welch! You saw what he was doing,
             right? You heard him!
Lionel starts shaking his head spastically.
<b>                         LIONEL
</b>             I can't be here! You understand?     I
             can' t--
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             Listen to me! It went to shit.     It
             happens sometimes.
In the distance, A POLICE SIREN WAILS, growing louder.
<b>                         LIONEL
</b>             Oh Jesus!
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             LISTEN to me! We don't have much time.
             We can still get through this but you
             have to keep your head and trust me!
Jake takes a tentative step forward.     Lionel sees a BLOOD
STAIN on Jake's shirt and recoils.
The SIREN GROWS LOUDER, Jake turning his head towards it.

<b>                            JAKE
</b>             Help me.
Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of.
<b>                                                           CUT TO:
</b><b>INT. - THE EUCLID BAR
</b>A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar.
A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with
face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel
Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway.
MILES, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the
edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled
with neat stacks of blood splattered money.
A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood.
Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in
disbelief.
<b>                           JAKE
</b>             Come on.    Grab his arms.
Lionel stands frozen.       Jake, drops the dead guy's legs
with a THUD.
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             Lionel... He's dead. Yeah, maybe you
             didn't pull the trigger, but you were
             standing right there and watched me do
             it. Help me. Grab his arms.
The POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER.
<b>                            MILES
</b>             Tick-tock...
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             If you wanna help, then help.    If not,
             shut up.
<b>                            MILES
</b>             Your mess.
<b>                         JAKE

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Miles lets out a little chuckle; it's just enough to set
Jake off again.
Jake pulls the gun and points it at Miles.
<b>                            MILES
</b>             Oh please...
Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under
the bar.
                         MILES (cont' d)
             You think this kinda shit hasn't happened
             here before? Given it's usually on
             Thursdays. And usually, I gotta tell
             the cops, "No, Officer... I didn't really
             get a good look at the shooters."
             Usually anyway.
<b>                         PATRON
</b>                 (without looking up)
             I didn't see nothing. And I swear if
             you let me go now, I won't say-
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             Relax, porkchop.
The POLICE SIRENS sound like they're right outside.
<b>                         LIONEL
</b>             I can't be here!
Jake cocks his gun, never taking his stare off Miles.
<b>                            JAKE
</b>             Then go.
Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money.
<b>                         LIONEL
</b>             What about... The money?
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             What about this situation makes you
             think I can answer that question right
             now?
Lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun
leveled at Jake; then at the direction of the POLICE
SIRENS... He runs for the door without a second thought.

<b>EXT.- THE EUCLID/CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT
</b>Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar
to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt
in front of the bar, lights flashing, SIREN WAILING. On
the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE
<b>DEPARTMENT.
</b>Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED
OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid. One of
the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder.
The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner--
<b>                      OFFICER (O.S.)
</b>          Everybody FREEZE!
As soon as he's turned the corner, Lionel breaks into a
full sprint down the street.
<b>                                                         CUT TO:
</b><b>INT.- THE EUCLID
</b>OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI, a middle aged cop with a couple
of spare tires, stands by the front door with his gun
drawn, in a dramatic stance.
<b>                      SOBOZINSKI
</b>              (yelling)
          I said, freeze you motherfucking,
          cocksucking, scumbags!
The second middle aged cop, OFFICER RICHARD ROTTOVICH
comes calmly down the stairs behind Sobozinski.
<b>                         ROTTOVICH
</b>          We're clear.
Rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him.
<b>                      SOBOZINSKI
</b>              (still yelling)
          Or I'll blow off every one of your
          fucking heads!
Sobozinski lets out a bellowing LAUGH.
We PAN OVER TO REVEAL Jake, Miles and BIG AL (the Patron)
sitting at the bar by the Dead Guy.
<b>                      JAKE
</b>          Stop waving that thing around.
<b>                      MILES

                 (re: the Dead Guy)
             Nice.
<b>                         DEAD GUY
</b>             What took so fucking long?
The Dead Guy stirs-- GORDO, late 20's, dressed in a blood
soaked suit stands up; wiping blood off his face.
<b>                         DEAD GUY/GORDO
</b>             I've been lying in this shit like half
             the night.
<b>                         MILES
</b>             You guys were late.   We had to go to a
             Mexican stand-off.
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             And you know I hate guns.
Jake tosses the revolver on the bar.
<b>                         SOBOZINSKI
</b>             We were fighting crime.
<b>                         MILES
</b>             Keeping the city streets safe for drug
             dealers and pedophiles everywhere.
Jake starts taking    the money out of the briefcases. Gordo
strips out of the    jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE
VEST. A wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up
the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody,
explosive squib.
Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing
fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot
where the squib was.
<b>                         GORDO
</b>             Shit.
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             I told you, use less powder.
<b>                         GORDO
</b>             But you won't get that splatter effect.
Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the
pile.

Big Al moves over to the bar.

</b>             Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to

<b>                         BIG AL
</b>             Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is

</b>             What are you talking about? You should
             get a fucking Academy Award for the
             Shill work you do.
                 (off Al's smile)
             We got it down cold, Al. You don't
             want to jinx it by changing something
             up, do you?

</b>             I' m gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want

Al slaps Jake on the back and exits.
Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder.
<b>                          JAKE
</b>             What?   I can feel you looking at me.
<b>                         GORDO
</b>             That's a lot of cash. He came up with

<b>                         JAKE
</b>             Probably some investment banker or

             you see how fast he ran out of here?
             It's done. He's not coming back.
<b>                         GORDO
</b>             I guess. I gotta drop a dime.    Did

<b>                           MILES

Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway.

Ahead of them, the hooded figure approaches, his hands
buried in his pockets, a knapsack slung over his shoulder.
As he gets closer, we see that he's just a KID of about

her a wink. Lily slowly raises her middle finger at him.

Lily saunters to Jake with a seductive grin.
Jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing.

          Keep the wallet. We're even. Take a

</b><b>INT. - TIFFANY'S - NIGHT
</b>Jake and Lily enter the store. Jake takes a quick moment
to case the place-- A few scattered CUSTOMERS, some being
helped by SALESPEOPLE. All the Customers look like the
uppercrust crowd you'd expect at Tiffany's.
<b>                         JAKE

             Oh yeah. This is good. This will do
             nicely.
                 (to Lily)
             This is about confidence. Your
             confidence and their confidence. You
             get their confidence by giving them
             yours.
Jake leaves Lily by the front counter as he starts a slow
turn around the store.
He casually pretends to be browsing as he moves next to
MR. LEWIS, an older, distinguished looking gentleman,
being helped by a SALEGIRL, who is scribbling on an order
form.
<b>                         SALESGIRL
</b>             Let me read this back. One silver
             Cattier watch, engraved-- "To Carolyn,
             the Attorney at Law. Happy Graduation,
             Counselor. Love Mom and Dad."

The Salesgirl takes the order form and walks away.
A change comes over Jake. It's subtle-- Posture, facial
expressions, a slight tug of an accent-- but it's there.
<b>                          JAKE
</b>             Mr. Lewis?
Mr. Lewis turns and looks at Jake. There's no real hint
of recognition, but Jake's smiling up at him like an old
friend.
<b>                          JAKE
</b>             It is you.   Hello!
Jake extends his hand.

Mr. Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his
hand more in an effort not to appear rude.
<b>                          MR. LEWIS
</b>             Of course.   Jake. Nice to see you.

<b>                         MR. LEWTS
</b>             Carolyn's down this weekend too.
Lily approaches. When she does, Jake pulls her close and
gives her a loving kiss on the lips. It throws Lily for
a second.

Lily and Mr. Lewis exchange handshakes.

Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around
her waist.

</b>             Right. The guys who started that did
             what a lot of companies in the Valley
             do. They get a good idea, shop it
             around, raise some capital, then sell
             it off to a bigger company. Microsoft,
             Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of
             it is, they've pretty much sold the
             company before they're even real. The
             bigger company is already set to buy
             it, all they want to do is make sure
             that the idea actually works. So they

             then sell it for like five times the

backhands Lily. She      goes flying back into the far wall,
bounces off and lands     with a THUD at Harlin's feet where
she finds the butter     knife.
Harlin reaches down and pulls Lily up by the hair.            The
egg SIZZLES in the pan.
Lily takes a stab at Harlin, but the knife just bounces
off his coat. Harlin slaps Lily again, sending her flying
into the stove. Smoke starts to rise from the burning
egg.

surrender.

She grabs the smoking pan from the stove and WHACKS Harlin
across the head. The burned egg lands on the floor.
Lily watches as he sways and teeters on his feet, like a
drunk. She raises the pan again... But before she
delivers the final blow, Harlin steps on the egg, causing
his leg to shoot out from under him. He lands flat on
his back, out cold. The wood floor CREAKS with his weight.

</b>             It's like putting on a play, where
             everyone knows their part except for
             the mark.
<b>                         BUTCH
</b>             Like putting on a play... Guess some
             people forgot their lines.
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             Guess so.
<b>                         BUTCH
</b>             So why don't you take a deep breath,
             Jake, and I'll count to ten. One.
             Two. Three...
As Butch continues to count, Jake slowly turns his head
and looks at Lily.
Butch, still counting, smiles at Lily's obvious contempt
then slides the gun along the back of Jake's head.
<b>                         JAKE
</b>             I do trust you, Lily.
Butch turns back to Lily to see her reaching into her
bag...
<b>                         BUTCH
</b>             Wha-
Butch spins and aims at her.
Lily pulls out a gun and... BLAM!!!

body. She then turns and runs back into the bar.

Moonan walks over to the Customs Desk and takes the
original black suitcase. He nods to the Customs Officer.

suitcase behind him.
