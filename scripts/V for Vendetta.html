</b>          In the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice.  Her name
          is Evey.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November, the gunpowder treason and
                    plot.  I know of now reason why the
                    gunpowder treason should ever be
                    forgot."
<b>          
</b>          Her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a
          deep centered peace that we can feel.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    Those were almost the very first
                    words he spoke to me and, in a way,
                    that is where this story began,
                    four hundred years ago, in a cellar
                    beneath the Houses of Parliament.
<b>          
</b>          In the darkness, we find a lantern.  Guy Fawkes, a dangerous
          man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow
          stacked with barrels of gunpowder.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to
                    blow up the Houses of Parliament.
<b>          
</b>          The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the
          cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of
          dogs.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    He was caught in the cellars with
                    enough gunpowder to level most of
                    London.
<b>          
</b>          Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as
          the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens
          of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    Sometimes I wonder where we would
                    be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder
                    if it would have mattered.
<b>          
</b>          In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    I suppose the answer is in the
                    rhyme.  More than the man, what we
                    must remember is the plot itself.
<b>          
</b>          The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He
          looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face,
          staring up at him.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    For in the plot we find more than
                    just a man, we find the idea of
                    that man, the spirit of that man,
                    and that is what we must never
                    forget.
<b>          
</b>          The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling
          down her face.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    This, then, is the story of that
                    idea, of that spirit that began
                    with an anarchist's plot four
                    hundred years ago.
<b>          
</b>          Guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red
          morning sun.

</b>                    I was born near the end of the
                    millennium, the year 1997.  My

                    to end that they were willing it to
                    happen.

</b>                    I don't remember much of the
                    century's turn.  I don't remember
                    the market crash or the plague or
                    any of the Trafalgar riots.

</b>          Little Evey sees her father staring at her mother.  They
          take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight.

                    the beginning of the 21st century,
                    there is one thing I do remember.
<b>          
</b>          Evey holds her father's hand.  Unable to see what is coming,
          she can hear it.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)

                    leather that gleamed bright in the
                    morning sun.  I had never seen such
                    boots.  All moving in perfect
                    unison.
<b>          
</b>          Little Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her

                    return to a bygone age, an age of

                    have been disparaged and all but
                    forgotten.  What this country needs
                    is a leader!  A true leader to
                    remind us of that age.  A righteous

                    o'clock, the fourth of November in
                    the year 2019 and this is the voice
                    of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285
                    of the medium wave.
<b>          
</b>          Beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled,
          "For your protection."
<b>          
</b>          Bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move,
          insect-like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little
          girl pedal her bicycle.  The little girl glances nervously
          over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her.

</b><b>          EXT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT

</b>          There is a radio on a small makeup table.

</b><b>                              FATE (V.O.)
</b>                    -- that Braxton and Streathon are
                    quarantine zones as of today.
<b>          
</b>          Evey is now a young woman.  She slips into a dress that is
          little more than a nightgown.  She tries to adjust it,
          pulling it down at the hem, pulling it up at the thin
          shoulder straps, but it is like trying to hide behind a
          lamppost.

                    avoided for reasons of health and
                    safety.

</b>          Another radio in a room that seems to be of another world.

                    end to meat rationing starting mid
                    February.
<b>          
</b>          A man enters the room as he once entered the world.  His body
          is lean and strong and though we do not see his face, there
          is a strength in his carriage, a power to his presence.

</b><b>          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
</b><b>          
</b>          She packs tissue paper into the toes of a pair of high heels
          that are too big for her.

                    the Birmingham area, uncovering
                    what is believed to be a major
                    terrorist ring.

</b><b>          
</b>          We move over a dressing bureau, past a wig and over a pair of
          black leather gloves, moving until we find the mask; it is
          like something from the masquerade ball of another era.  It
          has an exaggerated goatee, harlequin cheeks and a smile,
          forever fixed, at once be-guiling and be-deviling.

</b>          Evey coats her lips with a lascivious red.  She stares into
          the mirror, her makeup like a mask over her own face.

</b>                    I don't know what brought us
                    together that night.  I had never
                    been to that part of Westminster
                    but ever since I've known him, I've
                    stopped believing in coincidence.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT.  CITY STREET

</b>          Evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.

<b>          
</b>          He smiles.

<b>          
</b>          She presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and
          her woman's mouth.

                    doing.
<b>          
</b>          He pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge.  The sight of
          it knocks the breath out of her.

          violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind

          finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky.

                    conclude that, despite a level of

                    all home-made with over the counter
                    chemicals, making them impossible
                    to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader,

                    the fifth of November 2019 and this

                    moving in a positive direction. 
                    Last night's scheduled demolition
                    of two deteriorating landmarks went
                    off without a hitch.

                    fascism.  They had a symbol for it;
                    a bundle of twigs bound together. 
                    One twig could be broken but a
                    bundle would prevail.  That is the
                    heart and soul of fascism. 
                    Strength in unity.  I tell you
                    these things knowing full well that
                    they make you uncomfortable.

</b>          The church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as
          the final mass of the day has ended.
<b>          
</b>          The tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk, separating
          around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and
          gossip.

</b>          Church bells toll in the orange dusk above them.

</b>          Helen Heyer, a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind
          her looks and clothes she drapes them with, charges into the
          gossipers, her trophy husband in tow, a timid looking man
          that we recognize as Conrad Heyer.

</b>          She listens as his footsteps fade down the hall, the door
          hanging weirdly open.
<b>          
</b>          Evey takes a few tentative steps toward the door and sticks
          her head out into the empty hall, peering down both ways.
<b>          
</b>          Slowly, she emerges from her cell, retracing her path down
          the hall that her blindfold never allowed her to see.
<b>          
</b>          Quietly inching along the wall, Evey peeks around a corner,
          gasping at the rigid guard standing off to the side.  There
          is something about the man's frozen stare that keeps her from
          running.
<b>          
</b>          Evey straightens and crosses to the guard.
<b>          
</b>          It is a mannequin.
<b>          
</b>          She touches him, the wheeled platform he is mounted on
          rolling back against the wall.

          long she was questioned and tortured.
<b>          
</b>          She crosses to the frozen Interrogator sitting at his desk.
<b>          
</b>          Her finger brushes lightly against the plastic hand, then
          Evey raps a knuckle on his hollow wooden head.  Around his
          neck a small speaker hangs from a cord.
<b>          
</b>          Evey drifts uneasily into a back room where a discarded
          prison guard's uniform hangs on a rack.  On a table next to a
          wig and pair of gloves, the rat looks up at her through the
          bars of its tiny cage.
<b>          
</b>          She moves through another door, the wind suddenly knocked
          from her chest as she finally sees where her prison was
          built --

</b>          The heads of each department are gathered around a table of
          black granite.

</b>          Peter Creedy, sitting back out of the lights, is the new head

                    It is that very fact that keeps me
                    awake at night, wondering if
                    perhaps there is a reason that Mr.
                    Finch has failed.

<b>          
</b>          A character that is made to look like Adam Susan is giving a
          speech.  A woman is dressed like V except that the only thing

          and high heels.

</b>          Evey enters the gallery.  Her hair has grown out but is still

</b>          V drives the knife into his heart, killing him instantly.
<b>          
</b>          V stands alone amidst the carnage and seeping pools of red.

</b>          An enormous crowd has begun to gather in the streets
          surrounding the New Government Building.  With the crowd, a
          restlessness swells against each barricade erected by the
          military.
<b>          
</b>          A sergeant stands on an armored car, speaking through a
          megaphone.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SERGEANT
</b>                    Return to your homes!  There is
                    nothing to see!  The terrorist is
                    dead!
<b>          
</b><b>                              RABBLE ROUSER 1
</b>                    He ain't dead!
<b>          
</b><b>                              RABBLE ROUSER 2
</b>                    He'll be here, just like he said!
<b>          
</b><b>          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
</b><b>          
</b>          Evey huddles against the stair railing, her face tear
          stained, staring at the lifeless body of V.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    I remember... I remember staring at
                    the mask, at that smile.
<b>          
</b>          She touches the mask, her fingers finding its edge.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    Part of me couldn't believe he was
                    dead and maybe that was why.  The
                    smile was still the same. 
                    It made me want to tear it off so I
                    could see the face, so I could see
                    that he was dead.
<b>          
</b>          Her fingers stop.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    But I had promised.
<b>          
</b><b>                              V (V.O.)
</b>                    You will discover the face under
                    this mask but you will never look
                    beneath it.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    I began to try to imagine his face. 
                    Of course, I had long pictured my
                    father behind that smile but I knew
                    in my heart that V was not my
                    father.
<b>          
</b>          Evey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    Yet every time I pictured another
                    face, any face, something was lost,
                    something important was somehow
                    diminished.  V was more than a
                    face.  V was V.
<b>          
</b>          Her expression changes.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    And then, quite suddenly, quite
                    naturally, I realized whose face
                    must be beneath that mask.  It was
                    the only face that mattered.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY
</b>                    I won't let you die.
<b>          
</b><b>                              V (V.O.)
</b>                    I know you won't... I know.
<b>          
</b>          A small smile creeps across her face.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT.  CITY STREET
</b><b>          
</b>          Midnight approaches and the crowd feels it.  Spilling
          everywhere, they fill the streets like a flood.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT.  TRAIN CAR
</b><b>          
</b>          Evey sets a final violet carson on the chest of V.  He is
          lying on a bed made of gelignite, covered in roses.
<b>          
</b>          Touching his mask, she bends over him.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY
</b>                    Goodbye, my love.
<b>          
</b>          Tenderly, she presses her lips to the smile, her eyes
          closing, her final tears blinking free.
<b>          
</b>          She backs away and V smiles, his lips wet with her kiss, his
          cheek wet with her tears.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    "Ave Atque vale."
<b>          
</b>          On the train platform, Evey reaches through the window and
          starts the train.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    I looked it up the next morning.
<b>          
</b>          The wheels churn as the train lurches forward.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    "Hail and farewell."
<b>          
</b><b>                              V (V.O.)
</b>                    "Make them remember..."
<b>          
</b>          She watches the train disappear into the tunnel.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY
</b>                    They will, my love.  They will.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT.  CITY STREET
</b><b>          
</b>          The crowd surges against a barricade when a voice cries out
          across the city echoing through the megaphone on every
          corner.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)
</b>                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November!"
<b>          
</b>          High above the gathered mass, a masked figure steps out onto
          a roof parapet.
<b>          
</b>          The crowd explodes.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT.  SUBWAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The train barrels along, screaming against its rusted rails.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT.  ROOFTOP
</b><b>          
</b>          Dressed as V, Evey stands on the roof's edge, speaking into a
          microphone.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY
</b>                    I have come here tonight to keep a
                    promise.  A promise that is over
                    four hundred years old.  Tonight I
                    am here to give you your freedom!
<b>          
</b>          Again, the crowd bursts into a frenzy.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY
</b>                    Since mankind's dawn a handful of
                    oppressors have accepted the
                    responsibility over our lives,
                    responsibility that we should have
                    accepted ourselves.  By doing so,
                    they took our power.  By doing
                    nothing, we gave it away.
<b>          
</b>          The voice booms over the mesmerized crowd.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY
</b>                    Tonight, our world will change. 
                    Our leaders will be gone and we
                    must choose what comes next.  A
                    return to the chains of others or
                    lives of our own.  A world of the
                    past or one of the future.
<b>          
</b>          She feels the sea of humanity beneath her, almost channeling
          their energy.
<b>          
</b><b>                              EVEY
</b>                    Let us choose carefully, London,

                    and remember, remember this fifth
                    of November!
<b>          
</b>          The crowd screams as one and their scream becomes --
<b>          
</b><b>          INT.  SUBWAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The train hurling like a bullet through a gun barrel.  Ahead
          the tracks end, buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed
          tunnel.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT.  TRAIN CAR

</b>          Inside the rattling train, V lays in perfect repose.
<b>          
</b><b>                              V (V.O.)
</b>                    Let me be there, Evey, when it

</b>                    Please let me hear the music... one
                    last time... my music.
<b>          
</b>          Almost unconsciously, Evey raises her hand and coaxes the
          first soft notes as he had once done.
<b>          
</b><b>                              V (V.O.)

                    carefully.
<b>          
</b>          The violins of the 1812 overture steadily rise.

</b>          Evey smiles, her hand still gently conducting.

</b><b>          
</b>          Evey watches the explosion, a star-burst of flaming debris
          searing against the night sky like fireworks.
