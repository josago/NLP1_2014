</b>
          GEORGE SIMMONS, 42, sits in a giant living room watching bad
          television on a 70-inch flat screen TV. He looks bored and
          empty. After a few beats he pauses the TV, and picks up the
          phone.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          (on the phone)
          Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm
          coming in.

<b>          INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</b>
          Shots of George doing stand up on stage at a comedy club.
          The place adores him. We see quick images of him after the
          show interacting with people. He is clearly a very famous
          comedian.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          George has sex with a girl in her early twenties.

<b>          INT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT
</b>
          George sits back down, the thrill of his performance is gone,
          he is bored and alone again. He hits play on his TV and
          begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before.

<b>          INT. BEL AIR HOME - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          GEORGE wakes up in a large, clean, modern house. He is all
          alone. We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate
          his house. It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him
          at all. It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little
          cold. On the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is
          supposed to read.

<b>          EXT. GEORGE'S HOME - MORNING
</b>
          George hits balls in his home batting cage. Then we see him
          driving golf balls inside there. In the background we see
          his modern, space ship looking house. It is enormous.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM - LATER
</b>
          George walks into a fancy, steam-filled shower.

<b>          EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
          George drives his large black Mercedes.

<b>          EXT. MEDICAL TOWER - DAY
</b>
          George gets out of his car and walks towards the tower. Two
          COLLEGE STUDENTS walk over.

<b>          COLLEGE STUDENT
</b>          Hey George, can I get a picture
          with you?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sure buddy. Let's do it.
          One of the college students put his arm around George while
          the other takes the picture.

<b>          COLLEGE STUDENT #2
</b>          Can I get one?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yeah bud.
          They take the picture.

<b>          COLLEGE STUDENT
</b>          You're the man. We love all your
          movies, even the last one.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Thanks. Tell your friends.

<b>          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          George sits in the doctor's office staring at the photos of
          the doctor with his beautiful young children. DOCTOR STEVENS
          enters and sits down. He takes a deep breath.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I like those lunestas. They really
          put me to sleep without giving me
          the sleeping pill hangover I get
          from the restorils.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          I try not to take them too often.
          Just when I know I have to get up
          early.

<b>          DOCTOR STEVENS
</b>          George there are some
          irregularities in your blood
          work...
          George's face turns white. He knows what this means. The
          doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out--
          it is now all a jumble of words.

<b>          ANGLE ON GEORGE'S POV
</b>          We see photos of the doctor's family, his graduation
          certificates, files of other cases, odd doctor's office art,
          a picture of him skiing with his family. He keeps talking,
          but now we hear nothing.

<b>          EXT. MEDICAL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          George walks down the stairs towards the parking lot in a
          daze. An ASIAN GIRL and her MOTHER and BROTHER see him and
          start screaming.

<b>          GIRL
</b>          Oh my God. Can you take a picture
          with me?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yeah, sure.
          She puts her arm around him. Her little brother jumps in
          too.

<b>          GIRL
</b>          Thanks. You are the funniest.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Thanks, pal.

<b>          !NT. CAR - DAY

          head.

<b>          DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)
</b>          It's a rare blood disorder. In the
          family of Hodgkins disease. We
          really don't have a treatment for
          it. There are things we can try.
          They're all very experimental in
          nature.

<b>          GEORGE (V.0.)
</b>          I don't understand what this means.

<b>          DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)
</b>          I think you need to hope for the
          best and prepare for the worst. Is
          there someone who can help you get
          your affairs in order?

<b>          INT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET - DAY
</b>
          IRA, a 25-year-old, works at the deli counter, along with
          CHUCK, a large, sweet-looking 45-year-old deli counter lifer,
          and GAIL, a very skinny, very old, straight-talking,
          humorless woman in her fifties.
          Ira is in the middle of a very long conversation with a
          middle-aged WOMAN.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Is the turkey organic?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yes, ma'am.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Well what does organic mean?

<b>          IRA
</b>          It means there's no additives or
          preservatives and it's hormone
          free.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Are there additives or
          preservatives in the food they feed
          the turkey?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't know ma'am.

</b>
<b>          WOMAN
</b>          I heard that because turkeys are
          fatty birds, mercury gets stuck in
          their fat. My daughter-in-law, she
          ate turkey and then she had a
          miscarriage.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I haven't heard about that. But I
          may not be informed enough to
          comment.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Well, you're not a doctor, so you
          shouldn't comment.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You are correct, I am not a doctor.

<b>          INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER
</b>
          Ira and Chuck are preparing trays of food.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You should come see me do stand-up
          tonight at the Comedy and Magic
          Club.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          I can't go through that again, man,
          that was painful.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That was five months ago. I've
          gotten a lot better.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          They pay you yet?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Nah, not there. I just hang out and
          hope somebody doesn't show.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          Wow, is there anyway for you to.be
          lower in show business? I don't
          know if you could even say you're
          in show business. Why don't you
          just fucking settle down and enjoy
          this gig? This is a sweet
          situation. The money's good,
          you've got health insurance.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Dude, I know you like it here but
          if I have to work here another year
          I would kill myself.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          Really? In that case, when we bury
          you does it have to be in some kind
          of Jew cemetery? Next to Al Jolson
          or some shit?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Just come. I need the support.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          No way. I'm funnier than you. And
          I'm not even that funny. I would go
          if I was paying to see me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'll pay your cover charge.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          Okay, well you better be good,
          because I'm bringing a date.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Laughter's the ultimate lubricant.

<b>          INT. BEL AIR HOME - DUSK
</b>
          An Otis Redding song is playing as George walks around his
          house in a daze, not sure how to process this. He doesn't
          call anybody. There's nobody in sight. We see images of him
          thinking about the unthinkable and the life he's lead.
          He sits in his office, surrounded by photos of himself at
          difference ages. It builds to a sequence of him going
          through stacks of old photos and watching videos of himself,
          reviewing his life, trying to make sense of what it all
          meant. We see clips of his good movies and his last bad
          movie. On the wall is a poster of a buddy film which shows
          him and another famous comedian.
          ON-SCREEN -- home video of George at college. George is
          hanging out with his friends. They are acting goofy, having
          the time of their lives. George looks very young, skinny,
          and carefree. Life has never been better. They play a
          ridiculous drinking game and laugh uproariously.

<b>          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          Ira sits with one of his roommates, LEO, who is also an
          aspiring comedian. They sit across from each other, kicking
          around joke ideas they have, trying to write new ones. We
          see an entire pitch session play out.
          Ira's joke pitches are all over the place. He clearly hasn't
          figured out what his stage persona is yet.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I was thinking about doing
          something about how I'm not good
          looking and I'm not bad looking.
          I'm just good looking enough that
          if I had a good personality, it
          could put me over the top. If that
          was the case.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Yeah, something about how the
          uglier you are, the better the
          personality you need. And the
          hotter you are, the stupider you
          can be.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I had a joke once about how you
          never see incredibly hot, blonde,
          homeless women. Because someone
          will always take care of that kind
          of woman. That woman could be the
          dumbest person on earth and she
          will survive in this world.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Maybe something like... you can be
          hot and stupid and survive in the
          world. And you can be smart and
          ugly and survive in the world. The
          people who have trouble are the
          stupid, ugly people.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That could work.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Let me keep that one, because I
          thought of most of it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That's not cool. I came up with
          the concept! What do you got?
          Let's work on what you have.

<b>          LEO
</b>          I've got nothing in the notebook.
          I got drunk last night. But I need
          material, because I just got spots
          at the Improv. Budd saw me and
          approved me. I'm in.

<b>          IRA
</b>          How could they make you a regular?
          I got turned down twice.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Sorry, man. They're only going to
          let in one chubby, caustic Jew, so
          I think you're fucked.
          Their other roommate, MARK, walks in, waves a check at them.

<b>          MARK
</b>          Hey, dudes. You see this check
          that I got from my TV show for
          25,000 an episode? There was
          another one of these on the kitchen
          counter. Did you see it?

<b>          IRA
</b>          No we didn't see it. Just don't
          leave those things laying around.

<b>          MARK
</b>          I wouldn't leave it around if they
          didn't give me so many. They give
          it to me every episode.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Don't throw it in our face that
          you're on a shitty show.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I thought you were moving out.

<b>          MARK
</b>          I decided I like it here. Living

          don't want to be the guy living in
          the house on the hill. Even though
          I could afford it. Hey, I saw that
          girl comic you like who lives
          upstairs. I invited her in. She's
          here.

<b>          IRA
</b>          She's in our apartment? I've never
          even talked to her. I just gave
          her quarters at the washing
          machine.

<b>          MARK
</b>          You were right, she is pretty mousy
          and sexy. You gotta talk to her.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I need time. I have a three-month
          plan.

<b>          MARK
</b>          I'll give you ten days for your
          three-month plan, then I am going
          to fuck her. You can't just leave
          that laying around. Starting right

<b>          DAISY

<b>          MARK
</b>          Well I think you can download it to

          Ira walks in.

<b>          MARK (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey Ira, this is Daisy.

<b>          DAISY
</b>          how's it going?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Nice to meet you. I think I gave
          you quarters once.
          Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup.
          He pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup
          falls over and spills all over the counter. Mark looks
          horrified.

<b>          IRA (CONT'D)
</b>          (nervously joking)
          Don't worry, I'll just lick it off

          Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag.

<b>          MAGICIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          So when you get the light, don't go
          long. You've got one minute.
          ANGLE ON Leo on stage, doing a few more jokes. A MANAGER
          walks over to Ira.

<b>          MANAGER
</b>          Hey man. George Simmons just got
          here, he wants to go up. You're
          bumped. We'll put you on after
          George.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well how long is he going to do?

<b>          MANAGER
</b>          I don't know. Last night he did
          five minutes. Last week he did an
          hour. fie'il do what he wants to do.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well what about the magician? He
          just loaded his pigeons. He said I
          have to get off in ten minutes.

<b>          MANAGER
</b>          I'll have him unload the pigeons.
          Just be ready.
          Leo finishes his set to huge applause then comes off stage.

<b>          LEO
</b>          That was good, right? Some of the
          new stuff worked.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I just got bumped by George
          Simmons.

<b>          LEO
</b>          Are you serious? Shit - I've got a
          spot at the Improv, I cant hang
          out, damn.

<b>          ANGLE ON THE STAGE

<b>          EMCEE
</b>          A lot of times you hear about going
          to a comedy club and someone
          exciting shows up. I won't lie to

</b>          Ladies and gentleman, you know him
          from [movie credits to go here]
          George Simmons?
          George walks on stage. The place goes crazy. He does some
          of his normal routine and the audience laughs and is very
          appreciative.
          As George continues his act, it starts getting darker and
          darker until he is talking about death and the lack of
          meaning in it all.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Ah life. What does it mean?
          sometimes life makes perfect sense.
          And then you `come'.

<b>          ON IRA
</b>
<b>          IRA
</b>          He's killing the crowd. Jesus, I
          can't follow this shit.
          After completely losing the crowd, and some minor
          confrontations with audience members, he exits the stage.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Life isn't all about laughs. Crazy
          shit happens. You've got to be
          nice to each other. You never know
          what's going to happen.
          Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry I sucked it up out there. At
          least they are well rested for you.
          Ira, takes the stage. He starts trying to do his act, but he
          is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to take the
          weird energy of the room and spin it to his advantage. He
          basically bombs. We reveal Chuck and his date watching,
          looking miserable.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm not good looking. I'm not bad
          looking. I'm just in the middle.
          And if I had a personality that was
          Jut good enough, it would put me
          over the edge.
          The joke fails. We reveal George also watching him bomb,
          amused by his struggle. He sees something he likes in Ira.

<b>          EXT. PARKING LOT
</b>
          Ira walks to his car. In the spot next to him is an enormous
          Suburban SUV parked in a spot meant for compact cars. It is
          so close to Ira's car that it isn't possible to open the
          door. He hears some banging and odd wails from in the car.
          Ira knocks on the window. We see that George is sitting in
          his car in a world of pain. He's clearly been crying. The
          knock startles him. He turns to Ira.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Sorry, man. I didn't mean to
          disturb you. I just can't open my
          door. There's no room.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Oh I'm sorry. Let me pull out.
          George pulls the car back ten feet.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          (calling to Ira)
          Hey man, you had some funny shit
          tonight.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Thanks!

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Man, that audience hated you. They
          really did not like you. They liked
          your buddy, who looked exactly like
          you but was funnier. Man, that's
          going to haunt you. You're going
          to wake up in six months and think
          about this night.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, I'll probably bomb worse
          tomorrow and forget about this one.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm just fucking with you. You had
          some funny jokes in there. Good
          writing.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, obviously, I'm a... you
          know...I grew up on your shit, man.
          George just stares at him.

          two hundred people saw that
          tonight. I'll see you later.
          George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by
          Ira, he steers his car as if he's going to run him down, and
          starts screaming...

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          You're gonna die!!! I'm gonna kill
          you!
          Then he smiles at Ira and drives off. Ira smiles. This is
          the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.

<b>          IRA

          Leo passes by in the background. We see Ira decide not to
          include him in this job offer.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I don't know, about computers and
          shit. I could mainly do my act but

</b>
          Ira is writing jokes. The camera follows the letters being
          typed on the computer screen as he types.
          "Always erase your web history. I had a girlfriend hit
          history and see eleven hundred porn sites that I visited in
          an hour."
          Jonah sticks his head in.

<b>          LEO
</b>          I got one, but you have to tell him
          its mine. The best thing about
          Leopard is it lets you watch a
          porno, write a porno, shoot a
          porno, and order a porno all at the
          same time. And you guys made that
          possible.
          We see QUICK IMAGES of him typing and printing. He is
          writing an enormous amount of jokes. Way more than George
          will ever need. Writing, typing, re-writing in pen, then re-
          typing, etc.
          Ira hesitates, then hits send.

<b>          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          There's some funny shit in here.
          Not a bad ratio of good jokes to
          shit.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Thanks man. I just want to give
          you a lot of choices.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Too many choices. I don't like
          reading that much. I need like ten
          good jokes. I'm a little mad you
          made me read that many to get to
          ten. But thanks for doing it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Oh, it was fun to try to write in
          your voice. I spent the whole
          night pretending I was you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          So you cried yourself to sleep?

<b>          (ALT)
</b>          So you whacked off three times last
          night? Don't worry, I'll get you
          some money. Is five hundred good?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yeah! That'll work.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm leaving at four tomorrow to go

<b>          IRA
</b>          No you can't. Because then we look

</b>          How you doing, you ready for this?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yeah, this'll be fun.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I think I'm going to have you go on
          before me to warn them up.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You don't have to do that. What if
          I bomb?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, if you bomb, they'll just be
          more excited to see me. They'll be
          so glad your not on stage any more.
          Then if you do well, they'll be
          ready for me. Either way, you're
          helpful.

<b>          I/E PRIVATE JET - LATER
</b>          The limo pulls up to a private jet. Ira is shocked.
          A moment later they're picking up speed to take off. George
          seems really relaxed. Nothing registers that the jet is
          going faster and faster and taking off.

<b>

<b>          19.
</b>           As they're having a conversation, Ira seems really freaked
          out. Ira pretends he isn't.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I like this joke about watching
          porn and making porn all at the
          same time. That was a good one.

<b>          IRA
</b>          (turning white from

</b>          Oh good. Yeah, I thought you'd
          like that one. I was really happy
          with that one.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You want something to eat? I had

<b>          DAVE

<b>          IRA
</b>          (long beat)

          any credits. Maybe you could just
          say I've been working on Apples for
          so long, my first one weighed more
          than I did.
          Nobody laughs.

          Ira's on stage doing his act. He tells two jokes that don't
          do very well. And then he panics and does the joke about
          jerking off and shooting a movie all at the same time.
          ANGLE ON George, shaking his head, amused that he panicked
          and did one of the jokes he sold to him.

          Ira's walking off stage.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What the fuck is that? You did
          three of the jokes that you wrote
          for me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I panicked. They just wanted jokes
          about computers.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's why I hired you, to write
          jokes about computers.
          Ira takes out the long list of jokes he's written.

<b>          IRA
</b>          But there's a lot more. The first
          three on this page. You didn't
          think they would work, but I think
          they will. You should just try
          them.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          They better kill, I'm getting paid
          a hundred thousand dollars for

          George does a few Apple jokes that do kill, and then he
          segues into his normal act. When he wants to be, he is a

</b>          Well, I didn't make a hundred grand
          like you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I feel nothing. I remember when a
          grand was the most exciting thing
          in the world. I'd go to Red
          Lobster and go nuts. Now it's just
          numbers in a bank account. Enjoy
          tonight. You made a thousand
          bucks.

          George and Ira enter. People are very excited to see George.
          They give him a nice table.
          -- George and Ira talk to two women, MANDY and DAWN. They
          both seem really into George. Ira feels kind of left out.

          -- The other girl is now talking to a very uncomfortable Ira.
          She is not into it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, let's all go back to my house.

<b>          MANDY
</b>          Great!

<b>          IRA
</b>
<b>          (HOPEFUL)
</b>          Yeah, that sounds like a... nice

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
          Music is playing. Everybody is drinking. Mandy is doing
          some weird sort of sexy dance for George.

<b>          MANDY
</b>          This house is so big. It's bigger
          than the college I went to.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Oh there's a whole other wing that
          you wouldn't even know existed
          unless you went through this door.

<b>          MANDY
</b>          I want to see, I want to see.
          George and Mandy disappear. Ira and Dawn are left alone.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You are very pretty.

<b>          DAWN
</b>          I have a boyfriend. Nothing is
          going to happen.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I didn't say anything was going to
          happen. I just said you were
          pretty. How do you even know I
          wanted something to happen?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she
          left.

<b>          DAWN
</b>          Really?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sorry, that kind of stuff happens
          when you have a big house.

<b>          DAWN
</b>          Oh, well then I guess I better get
          going?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You don't have to go. I'm just
          saying that she left. I think she
          left her purse in the other wing.
          Come with me, let's go get it.
          Ira watches this, astonished.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT' D )
</b>          Did Ira tell you I have a room with
          all the classic pinball machines

<b>          DAWN
</b>          That sounds awesome.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          (to Ira)

          second.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
          Ira is now watching the end of the movie by himself. George
          sticks his head in.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That girl left. You want to talk
          to me while I try to go to sleep.
          Ira doesn't know what to make of this.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I guess so.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
          George is in bed under the covers, comfortably laying on his
          pillow. Ira sits in an easy chair located right next to the
          bed.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Did you have sex with both of those
          girls?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm afraid I did. I'm sorry. It
          was just so clear that you were not
          going to get it done. I figured
          you wouldn't mind.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That is crazy. That is super
          crazy.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It was great. It was crazy great.

<b>          IRA
</b>          How can that even happen? I guess
          I understand the first one, but why
          would the second one do it? You
          probably stink of the first girl.

</b>
<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well, we took a steam shower
          together.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          she had never seen a steam shower
          before, I told her she should enjoy
          it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          She wouldn't fool around with me
          because she said she had a
          boyfriend.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She told me that too, but she says
          I was on her and her boyfriend's
          list of people she was allowed to
          screw. You'd be surprised how many
          women have me on that list.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I should get going.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Just talk to me before I fall
          asleep. I'm weird. I don't like
          being alone. You should crash in
          one of the rooms. You're too drunk
          to drive home. I won't try to fuck
          you, I just fucked two women and
          I'm kind of done.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I may have to whack it in your
          guest room.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Whack away, I don't give a shit.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Hey, you were funny tonight. I
          could see how you could get good.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Thanks. That was fun. It was rare
          that I get to play to more than
          twenty-five people. I've never
          played for a thousand.

</b>          it, s kind of easier, because even
          if two hundred like me, it sounds
          like a lot.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I do feel bad for you, because no
          matter how hard you try, you'll
          never be as funny as me.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Why would you say that?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Did your dad crack you on the head
          when you were a kid?

<b>          IRA
</b>          No.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's why. My dad always seemed
          annoyed with me. He'd always crack
          me on the head. You would not see
          it coming. I spent my whole
          childhood trying to make my dad
          laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But
          he was an awesome guy. He was the
          coolest. He just got annoyed with
          me. Do you like your parents?
          They can't be that bad, because
          you're not that funny.

<b>          IRA
</b>          They're bananas. And always broke.
          They got divorced ten years ago,
          but they both act like it just
          happened last week. They hate each
          other. They always put me in the
          middle of it. I always wanted them
          to say, "We don't want you to
          suffer through this, so we're just
          going to handle it ourselves."
          They never would do it. They would
          always make me feel their pain all
          the time. I would never do that
          for my kids. Because it's like
          they._`.re kids. And no matter how
          many times I tell them to leave me
          out of it, they never do.
          Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep.

          (knows he's a sleeping
          pill at this point)
          I work at a supermarket at the deli
          counter. I hate it, but the
          money's actually pretty good.
          Better than you'd think. But I'd
          rather do comedy full-time if I

          The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin
          to HEAR George snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING

          George walks into the guest room, where Ira is sleeping.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey man, you want to make me
          breakfast?

<b>          IRA
</b>          okay.

</b>          Eggs.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Okay, let's have some eggs.
          While Ira is cooking, George takes a lot of pills.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What are you doing, man? Are those
          vitamins?

<b>          GEORGE

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I've got some crazy blood disease.
          They think I'm going to die in six
          months to a year. Some weird
          thing, almost nobody has it. All
          these are experimental.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Are you fucking with me? That's

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No, I'm telling you the truth.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I never heard that before. That
          would be a big deal.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I haven't told anybody yet. I
          don't think I'm going to.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You're not going to tell anybody?
          You told me.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well it's easier with you because I
          don't know you. I don't feel weird
          around you. I don't want to be
          treated like a guy who's going to
          die.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't know, man. I don't think
          you want to go through this alone.
          I think you've got to tell people.
          Your family. Your friends.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Actually, the reason why I only
          told you is I need you to do me a
          favor.

</b>          What? Anything, man.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I can't imagine suffering through
          the final stages of this. So...I
          was going to ask you if you would

          it, and I wouldn't have to suffer.
          I got a gun that is untraceable.
          And a silencer. And I thought
          maybe tonight, I would take a bunch
          of sleeping pills, and when I slept
          you would put a bullet in my head.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I can't do that!

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'll give you fifty thousand

<b>          IRA
</b>          Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at
          least take a little time to think
          about it?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Holy shit, you would do it. You
          were literally thinking about doing

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm an asshole, you were about to

          made us so happy in our lives, this
          is our chance to do something from
          him during this time. There's a
          lot of wisdom we can take from
          this. What he's going through. We
          can apply it to our lives.

          George and a few of his friends are playing a famous rock

          George and Ira are waiting at the parking valet. The car
          pulls up. As they get in:

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I was thinking about it. I could
          throw you some money every week for
          coming up with new jokes for me.
          Maybe you can organize them in the
          computer, keep track of what I'm
          doing.

</b>          Absolutely. What do you want to

</b>          Okay, that could work.

          life.

          George and Ira are writing jokes. Ira keeps pitching
          premises/rough joke ideas that George instantly makes ten
          times better off the top of his head. (We shoot this process
          for real with multiple cameras and try to catch lightning in

          some material about what you're
          going through, being sick. There
          could be something really powerful,

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Really? How long you gonna keep
          that job for? I'm paying you good

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I wasn't like you. I had a
          different theory. You've got to
          spend money to make money. Nothing
          makes you work harder than being in
          debt. Maybe we should go buy a
          Corvette. That'll make you try to

          feel better than if you just deal
          with everything. Where are your
          parents?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          P4y parents would drop dead if I
          told them what was happening.
          They're in their 80s. They don't
          have to go through this. I'll make
          sure they find out at the last
          possible second.

</b>          Friends?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I don't think I do. I thought I
          did. I got a lot of people I know,
          shoot the shit with, fuck around
          with. But I realized when this
          happened I'm not close to anyone.
          I had no one to call. My
          friendships are Hollywood
          friendships. When I was lying in
          bed I couldn't think of one person
          I wanted to share this with. Maybe
          it's me, maybe I never got close to
          anybody.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I think if you talk to people you'd
          find out a lot of people care about
          you. You're kind of old already, I
          mean, compared to me. I'm sure you
          touched a lot of people's lives.
          You can't spend the rest of your
          days making phoney phone calls
          alone in your room.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          The only reason I did that was
          because I couldn't sleep. And I
          had no one to call.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well maybe that's the problem.
          Maybe if you told more people you'd
          have more people to call. You
          can't just talk to me about it, I
          don't know what the fuck I'm
          talking about. You're the first
          person I've known who's sick. I'm
          not good at it.

</b>          I'm sorry, George. I really don't
          know what to do, I don't know how

</b>          That's very gay.

<b>          COMEDIAN#2
</b>          No, it was a buddy thing. It was
          very heterosexual.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Admit it, you were masturbating.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          And I kept making her talk and say
          crazy shit just to make him laugh.

<b>          COMEDIAN #2
</b>          I think at one point you said, "Say
          my hog is the biggest you've ever
          seen." And then there is this long
          pause.

<b>          COMEDIAN#3
</b>          That's a bad sign. If it was big
          at all she wouldn't have paused.

<b>          COMEDIAN #1
</b>          Remember you used to have that joke
          about how you used to only date
          midgets because your dick looked
          bigger in their little hands.

          from the studio and I used it to

          doing well, and that's not going to
          last forever. You should do
          something active. Go to Colorado,
          or Tahoe, or something. Or do
          something crazy. Go to Switzerland,

          can masturbate in the room thinking

          George and Ira are watching videotapes of George doing stand-
          up when he was much younger. He's really, really funny. And
          very skinny, with a much more pronounced New York accent.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You know, I never got married. I
          never had kids. I didn't get to do

          George is singing a happy song with a bunch of musician
          friends, like a Lou Reed/Velvet Underground (or Ramones/New

          George walks around his grounds, slowly. And one gets the
          sense he's never looked around and seen where he lives
          before. He likes it.

<b>          INT. IMPROV - NIGHT
</b>
          George performs at the Improv. We see him gesture to a woman
          that she can come up on stage and she hugs him. The crowd
          erupts. She runs back to her seat. George continues with
          his act.

          George and Ira hike up a hill.

</b>
          Lisa and her husband are now over, and George is talking to
          them and playing with her two-year-old boy.

<b>          EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</b>
          George is sitting with his parents. It is clear he recently
          told them about his situation, and although there is sadness
          in the air, they look happy to be close for the first time in
          a long time.

          Ira is asleep on the couch. George walks over with a bowl of
          ice cream. He whacks Ira a few times trying to wake him up,

          Ira and watches TV while eating his ice cream.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I thought a lot about my work when
          I was sick and I'm in sort of a
          strange place career-wise, because
          I'm normally the goofy, funny guy
          and I don't know if people are
          expecting a change from me. And I
          think people are expecting me to
          evolve, and it's important to
          evolve before they make a point of
          asking me why I'm not evolving.

          new ground.

          at the deli. I'm not asking you
          for your advice, I just though we
          could start trying to come up with
          an idea.

          Are you freaking out right now?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It's very strange. It's gonna take
          me a few days to process it, but
          it's a gift and I'm going to treat
          it that way.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I had to drop out of college after

          her get a job.

<b>          BOB
</b>          I didn't realize I raised such a

          would have done anything for my
          family.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Then sell your house. Move into a
          smaller house. Use the extra money
          to pay for her college. Or tell
          her to work for a year or two, make
          some money, then she can pay for
          her own college. No one helped me
          out, I'm just digging out from

          Then your mind opens up a little
          bit, you know? Maybe it's

          start to see more of the big plan.

          And hopefully next year I'll get to
          screw that girl on Mark's show.
          All our dreams will come true. You
          guys will get an apartment with
          less pubic hair on the toilet seat,
          you'll be able to afford a maid.
          Maybe next year you guys can get a
          better celebrity than me. Maybe
          Wolf Blitzer will come. I also
          pray that no one put their balls on
          this turkey, I'm kind of scared you
          guys are about to give me
          salmonella poisoning. I know this
          Orphan's Thanksgiving it's just a
          normal Thanksgiving for you guys,
          but it's a very special one for me.
          I'm very glad to be here. I'm not
          that glad to be here with you, but
          I thank you for having me. I'm
          sure it will be very memorable for

          to me because he's so mad he can't

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I was thinking that now might be a
          good time for me to make that
          script "Making Amends."

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Do you really think people want to
          see you make a movie about a guy
          who goes to AA but isn't really an
          alcoholic? He just needs the
          companionship? That's a pretty big
          left turn.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          You know, I read it four years ago.
          I need to read it again. I don't
          remember not liking it. I just
          can't tell you the studio will make
          it. Your last few movies didn't do
          so well.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I thought they did well overseas.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          You always do well in Australia,
          but that's about it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What if I do it for no money, just
          with back-end?

<b>          TERRY
</b>          I don't know if that's going to cut
          it either. The head of the studio
          does a lot of drinking, I don't
          think he finds that whole area
          funny. Maybe if you commit to do
          another one of the Davey movies, I
          could tie it to that, so they have
          to do both.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'vedone four Davey movies.They
          wantme to do another sequelto
          that?We don't even have ascript.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Wellthere's this great script
          goingaround town, Happy Holidays.
          Whichis about an immature 40 year
          old man who acts like a kid. In it
          he comes home for the holiday
          season for the first time in ten
          years. And havoc ensues. You get
          to make fun of Thanksgiving, and
          Hanukkah and Christmas and New
          Years. They say they can turn it
          into a Davey movie.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Could I at least shoot the Making
          Amends movie first?

<b>          TERRY
</b>          I wish you would. You've never
          been able to do it in the past.
          You always talk a big game about
          writing your own shit. But I've
          yet to see a script land on my
          desk.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DUSK
</b>
          George and Ira are sitting at a large kitchen table. There
          is a computer on the table and index cards. On the floor is
          a corkboard.

<b>          IRA
</b>          See, the thing I was thinking,
          was...you always play an immature
          guy. What if the joke of the movie
          is you're incredibly smart,
          intellectual and well-mannered.
          You just go the opposite way with
          it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          There's nothing funny about being
          smart. All comedy comes from
          immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry
          Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC
          Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin,
          Charlie Chaplin. They were all
          immature. They were all
          knuckleheads. Who wants to see a
          smart guy live his life normally?
          What's funny about that? What else
          you got?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I. .I gotta go through my notes.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I'm thinking about taking a gig,
          and having a solid hit before
          getting into breaking new ground.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well we'll still write the script,

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yeah, if we can come up with an
          idea.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Let's just keep banging at it.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I can't. I've got a date.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You have a date? Who do you have a
          date with?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This woman my agent set me up with.
          She raises money for this
          environmental group. I guess she's
          like a normal person. I can't live
          here alone in this house forever.
          I need something of significance in
          my life. So I'm gonna go out on
          some dates. No pressure.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You know what you should do, just
          as an experiment? You should try
          and not fuck her?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Why would you say that?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Because you're always saying you
          don't know if women like you for
          who you are. You don't know if
          they like you because you have
          money or you're famous. Why not
          take some time and get to know them
          before ass-raping them. In a
          romantic way.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's insulting. Don't take out
          your frustrations on me because you
          can't get laid by acting like I'm
          some sort of deviant. I'm an
          adult. I have adult sexual
          relationships. No one does what
          they don't want to do. Sex is how
          people decide if they like each
          other. I'm testing my
          compatibility by ass-raping them.

          even entertain the idea of getting
          to know somebody for a month before
          sleeping with them.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's not true. I'm bored of sex,
          anyway. There is literally no body-
          part/orifice combination I haven't
          experimented with. There is
          nothing left to do. There is no
          nationalities I haven't.slept with,
          no age groups I haven't slept with.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You know, I haven't been out on a

          first one.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          Oh I go out on them all the time.
          I've been on a bunch of J Dates.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What's J Date?

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          It's a website where Jewish people
          find each other.

<b>          GEORGE

          Jewish people? I thought we didn't
          liked to be tracked and monitored
          like that.
          She looks at him, doesn't get the joke.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          You know, because of
          the... holocaust.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          (not understanding)
          It's just a great way for like-
          minded people to meet.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What if you don't like Jews?
          She just stares at him.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm joking.
          (a beat)
          So, uh, I hear you raise uh money
          for an environmental group. That
          must be very satisfying.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          It is, because, fixing the
          environment is really about having
          enough of a war chest to sue local
          government and corporations so
          they're forced to observe the
          environmental statutes that are
          already on the books. We also try
          to put pressure on the government
          to put pressure on other countries
          to clean up their environmental
          act. You know, one dilapidated
          factory in China can produce more
          pollution than every car in America
          puts out in one year.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          See? That's why I still drive a
          big truck. I stop driving that
          truck and that factory shuts down.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          (not smiling)
          I know you're joking, but it's a
          very serious situation. People
          like you do a lot of damage to the
          environment. Whether it's taking a
          private jet by yourself, or getting
          driven around town limos around
          town or living in your gas-guzzling
          houses. Your carbon footprint is
          huge.

          intermission I want yQ.u to tell her
          I'm not sick anymore.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Me? Why do you want me to tell
          her?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Because it's weird, and emotional.
          I think she'll handle it better if
          it comes from somebody else. And
          then I can talk to her about it
          afterwards.

</b>          That's weird.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She'll be happy. It's not weird.
          You're the bearer of good news.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You had to do this to me right
          before my set. Like I'm not
          nervous enough.

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. THEATER
</b>
          Ira is performing on stage, doing his set. He's doing really
          well. This theater crowd is very enthusiastic about being
          there and gives him the benefit of the doubt on most of his
          jokes. As he continues his set, he gets more confident and,
          for the first time in the film, we think he has the potential
          to be a strong comic.

<b>          INT. THEATER - INTERMISSION
</b>
           Laura is sitting in her seat by herself. Ira makes his way
          across the aisle and sits down next to her.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Ira. Oh my gosh. You were so
          good.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You seem surprised.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I don't know, you seemed so
          nervous. But you were really solid
          all the way though, and your ending
          hunk really murdered.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Thank you. Hopefully George won't
          be mad if I tired the audience out.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I don't think he has anything to
          worry about. They always go crazy
          for him. Before he got famous, he
          used to bomb all the time.

<b>          LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          And that's when I think he was the
          funniest. And now that everyone
          knows him, it's a little too easy
          for him, I think. No one was
          funnier when the audience hated him
          than George. He loved it.

<b>          IRA
</b>          So you guys were dating right when
          he started doing well?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yeah. But you always knew he was
          gonna do well. He had so much
          charisma. He would walk into a
          room and in ten minutes that whole
          room would be about him. Even
          before anyone knew who he was.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Where did you meet him?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I was the hat-check girl at the
          Improv. And I was acting. I used
          to do guest spots on all those
          shows, like Melrose Place, Beverly
          Hills 90210. I always played the
          bitch. I don't know why, but I was
          on the top of the bitch list.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You don't seem like a bitch.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          That's because I was acting.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Sounds like fun days.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          It was, for awhile.
          Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from
          a distance.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't know if you've heard, but
          it looks like George's medicine is
          working.

</b>          When George got sick they didn't
          think they had any medicine that
          would help, so they put him on
          experimental medicine. And the
          last time he went to the doctor
          they couldn't detect his blood
          disease. They think it might be
          gone.
          A moment as Laura takes this in.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Why didn't George tell me?

<b>          IRA
</b>          He just found out. He doesn't want
          to jinx it. He doesn't want people
          to get excited, and then have it
          come back again.
          The lights go down.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
</b>          Ladies and Gentlemen. Here's the

</b>          I thought everyone came to see me.
          George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look
          more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show
          for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of
          events.
          The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more
          positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being
          sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious,
          and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him
          look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you
          could trust and spend your life with.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I really don't know what to say.
          It's not like you weren't good
          before, but your act is so much
          more sophisticated, but just as
          funny. I've never seen you speak
          so honestly on stage before. You
          used to say these goofy jokes. It
          was really something, you know, and
          you should be really proud of
          yourself.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Thanks. A lot has happened. And
          at least I got some good jokes out
          of it.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm
          really glad I came.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Ira and I are driving out of town
          tomorrow, I thought maybe we could
          stop by your place on our way out.
          I want to see what the ranch looks
          like, and meet your husband.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          My husband is actually in China for
          another week, or so. He spends a
          lot of time there helping American
          businesses break into that market.
          So you won't meet him this time,
          but it would be great if you came
          by. That would be fun. I'll give
          you the tour.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Okay. We'll come by in the
          morning.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Okay.
          An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs
          George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have
          equal weight.

<b>          LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          Bye. I'll see you then.
          She looks at Ira. As she exits--

</b>          Why do we have to stop by there
          tomorrow? The drive is long enough
          as it is.
          George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Here's your money for tonight.
          Good job.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm excited to see her ranch. I
          hear it's delightful.

<b>          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Ira and George are in a room that has two queen-sized beds.
          They each lay on their bed in the dark.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Why couldn't we have gotten two
          different rooms?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What's the fun in that? You can go
          pay for your own room, I don't
          care.

<b>          IRA
</b>          So, what happened with you and
          Laura? You seem to get along so
          well. Why did you cheat on her?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I was young, stupid... and I liked
          fucking girls. Why do you think I
          cheated? You would do it too if
          anyone would fuck you.

<b>          IRA
</b>          How many times did you cheat on
          her?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Two or three times ...a week ...for a
          couple of years.

</b>          Jesus.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It was awful. There was even
          marriage talk. My parents didn't
          want me to do it because she wasn't
          Jewish. She was taking classes to
          convert, even. I mean, how cool is
          that? She was changing religions
          to be with me. She knew more about
          being a Jew than I did from those
          classes. She was so cute when she
          spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong.
          George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          And then one day, somebody told
          her, I don't know who. And that was
          that.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Why do you want to go see her
          tomorrow? We could do something
          productive like get some writing
          done.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I like her. I love her. I miss
          her. I just want to spend a little
          time with her. I know nothing will
          come of it. I just miss being
          around her.
          A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult
          movies.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Anything looking good to you?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I don't want to watch adult movies
          with you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          okay. You want to watch Juno?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Okay.

<b>          EXT. LAURA'S RANCH - DAY
</b>
          George and Ira drive up to the house. It's a large one-story
          house that is part of a ranch with a lot of land and a horse
          stable.
          They walk to the front door, ring the doorbell. George seems;
          a little nervous.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You okay, buddy?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yeah, of course I am.
          Laura opens the door.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Hi? We've been waiting for you.
          Come on in.

<b>          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - CONTINUOUS
</b>

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This place is beautiful.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Thanks. We've been here for five
          years. I think I just finished
          decorating it.
          She leads them through the living room into a huge open
          kitchen. On the island, there is freshly squeezed lemonade,
          chips and dip. She has over-prepared for their arrival.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Can I live here?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          of course, you can clean the
          stables.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You have horses?

<b>          90.
</b>
<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yes. Clarke, my husband, was a
          real city boy. But for some reason
          he loves horses. Of course I'm
          lef t to take care of them. But
          yes, we have three horses.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That's crazy, owning a horse. I
          can't even keep a goldfish alive.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          All right, well, we're ready for
          the big tour. I want to see how
          you live.
          Suddenly, Laura's five-year-old daughter INGRID runs into the
          room and she's pissed.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Mom! You said you were coming
          back! We're playing American Idol,
          you're ruining the game!
          Ira is shocked to see that Laura has a child. This
          complicates a situation he already thought was getting too
          complicated.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I'll come right up. This is my
          friend, George. And Ira.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          It's my turn to sing and you're
          supposed to be the judge and you're
          not in there and I'm very angry!

<b>          IRA
</b>          How old are you?

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Five. But I turn six very soon.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Really? Because I thought you were
          like nine, about to turn ten.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She's very pretty.
          (to Ingrid)
          I like your hair.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          INGRID
</b>          I'm so sick of people telling me
          they like my hair.
          George is clearly not that good with kids.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Okay. I do not like your hair.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Don't make fun of me.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          He's just joking Ingrid.

<b>          IRA
</b>          My hair. I have curly hair too.
          Curly hair is the best.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Last week my mom straightened it
          and it almost went to the floor.

<b>          IRA
</b>          If you straighten my hair, I look
          crazy. I look like the killer from
          No Country for Old Men. Have you
          seen that movie?
          MABLE, Laura's ten-year-old daughter storms into the room.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          You guys left me all alone in the
          playroom! If you're gonna leave
          I'm just gonna go talk on the
          webcam with Caroline.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Don't be rude. This is Ira and
          George.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          Oh, I know you. My mom watches
          your movies all the time. But most
          of them I'm not allowed to see.
          George smiles at Ira--Laura's a little busted.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Oh, really? Do you like them?
          Which one's your favorite?

</b>
<b>          MABLE
</b>          I don't know. I don't really like
          the ones I'm allowed to see, but I
          think I would like the ones I'm not
          allowed to see. But she says I
          cant' see them till I'm sixteen.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sixteen? Just fast-forward past
          the bad parts.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          The whole thing is a bad part.
          George LAUGHS in a slightly flirty fashion with Laura. Ira is
          getting uncomfortable with the subtext.

<b>          LAURA (CONT' D )
</b>          C'mon, let's finish the game.

<b>          INT. PLAYROOM
</b>
          George, Ira, Laura, and Mable are sitting on the floor.
          Ingrid stands on a make-shift stage singing a Miley Cyrus
          song while wearing a feather boa and sunglasses and a red
          wig.

<b>          INGRID
</b>
<b>          (SINGS)
</b>          You've got the best of both worlds.
          Rock it out take it slow. And then
          you rock out the show!
          Everyone applauds for her.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Okay. Now it's time to see what
          the judges say. I thought you had
          a lot of energy, you're clearly
          gonna make it to the final four,
          and I love your outfit. What do
          you think, Randy?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It
          was a little pitchy in places, but
          I dug it. I really dug it.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          .I'm Simon, and I thought it was
          horrible. I don't how you made it
          this far in the competition.

</b>          Mable, stop it. Stop being mean to

</b>          I can't believe I'm saying this,

          They all applaud. Ira notices Laura looking at George with
          admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Okay Mable, you're up.
          Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not
          appropriate for a ten-year-old and singing the Fergie song
          "London Bridge."

          Laura sits on a ATV. George sits behind her. Ira is on
          another ATV with Ingrid sitting in front of him, as he
          steers. Mable rides a very small dirt bike.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          All right! Here we go.
          They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of
          the ranch. George has his hands around Laura's waist as they
          drive. Ira looks over, concerned.

          Laura slows down and allows Ira, Mable and Ingrid to get
          ahead and turn a corner. Then she stops the ATV and turns
          around and kisses George.
          George looks surprised, but happy. Laura just stares at him,
          trying to decide what she makes of him now. Then we hear

          The kids are playing in the background as George, Laura and

</b>          Ira, Laura invited us to stay over

</b>          But it's like a seven, eight hour
          drive home. If we stay for dinner,
          we're not going to get home till

          George stares at Ira for a beat, then --

</b>          Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
          You have something to do in the

</b>          No.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Me and George are gonna go to the

<b>          INT. LAURA'S SUV - DAY
</b>
          Laura is driving through town. George sits in the passenger
          seat.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This town is so small and adorable.
          It's like out of a Demi Moore
          movie.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Clarke's company is about forty-
          five minutes from here. This town
          seemed so perfect when we were
          looking for a house. There's no
          traffic, there's one coffee house,
          one bookstore, one market. No
          crime. But after you've lived her
          a few years you hunger for another
          coffee shop, a bigger bookstore,
          and a little crime. It gets so
          boring. And it's such a small
          town, God forbid you miss one of
          you kid's soccer games, they put
          the scarlet letter on you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          it can't be that bad. You live on
          a pretty little ranch. You have
          horses, a duck. It must be a nice
          life.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          We used to have so much fun. I
          don't think I have that much fun
          anymore. I don't like who I'm
          turning into. Is the fun over? I
          have to get up every morning at
          six, drive my kids to school and
          then I have 6 hours before I have
          to pick them up. I have to yell at
          them to do their homework, be a
          taskmaster, then I make them
          dinner.

</b>           It takes an hour to shower them and
           put them to bed. And then it's
          8:30 and I pass out. And it's
           great, but tuck. And when both
           kids are done with high school I'll
          be 49 years old, and then I'll have
           probably 6 very healthy years, then
          I'll kind of slow down and then
          I'll be an old woman. And that was

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I couldn't believe you moved out of
          LA. You were getting some good
          jobs as an actress. You got to
          play the bitch on Melrose Place for
          awhile and make out with Andrew
          Shue. That was pretty good. Do you
          miss it?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yes. Being a mom is very
          fulfilling, but there are other
          parts of me and every once in
          awhile I go a little crazy.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          How do you go crazy?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I just get bored and depressed.
          And you know how my PMS is kind of
          out of control. This little boy
          hit Ingrid in school, and his mom
          acted like she didn't care at all,
          so I told her to fuck off.
          They both laugh.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Oh, that must have gotten ugly.
          How long did that stay awkward for?

<b>          LAURA
</b>
<b>          (JOKING)
</b>          Always. That woman hates me. And
          I hate her. And now our kids
          really like each other, so it's
          really fucked up.

          Ira, Mable and Ingrid are making elaborate paper mache heads.
          As they do it, Ira is leading them in the type of song you
          would sing at camp.

<b>          INT. LAURA'S SUV - DAY
</b>

<b>          LAURA
</b>          And my husband cheated on me, said
          he did it once but I know because I
          learned from you, they do it once,
          they do it all the time. You
          either cheat or you don't.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          well I don't anymore. I haven't
          cheated on anybody since you. I
          haven't even been in a committed
          relationship since you, so it's
          impossible for me to have cheated.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          That's both flattering and deeply
          disturbing.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I thought a lot about you when I
          was sick, and I would do anything
          for another chance. I know it
          creates a mess, but I think it
          would be worth it. I think we both
          know it's what we should be doing.
          He kisses her.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          We can't go the supermarket.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Why?

          is making a Spongebob SquarePants puzzle on the floor with
          Mable and Ingrid.

</b>          Food's here! All right, everybody.
          Let's sit down at the kitchen
          table.
          Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen. Laura opens
          the front door, George is a few steps behind her. A handsome
          man of forty appears. This is not the pizza guy. It's
          CLARKS, Laura's husband.

<b>          LAURA (CONT'D)

          which I went to, and him and his
          opening act, Ira, came by to say
          hello on their way out of town.
          There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives
          George a compassionate look, the type of look you give a man
          you think is dying.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          It is really nice to meet you,

          A long pause.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sounds like your business is going
          very well.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          People never thought China would do
          this much business with us, you
          know, but it didn't seem like a
          risky proposition for me. They've
          got a billion people, we make all
          kinds of cool shit in America,
          they start finding out about it on
          the internet and what-not. Sooner
          or later they're gonna find a way
          to get our shit.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          He speaks Chinese. For real.
          Ingrid yells at something in Chinese.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You don't think they want new
          mobile phones? A new X-box? I'm
          trying to get access into North
          Korea, no shit. That situation
          could chance overnight. That is a
          huge market waiting to be tapped.
          It's already starting in Cuba.

<b>          IRA
</b>          My friend backpacked across China
          and he caught some sort of virus or
          something from what he ate. He was
          sickforweeks. He still has it.
          It'sthekind of thing you can't
          getridof, you have it for the

          up?

</b>          How are you feeling?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          He's doing really well. He's been
          very strong.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          It's a terrible situation. I'm so
          sorry.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I appreciate that.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          He's been fighting the good fight.
          His doctors are taking very good
          care of him.
          Ira can believe this conversation is happening.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You're a tougher man than me. I
          don't know how I could go about my
          day with that hanging over my head.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It just makes you appreciate every
          moment. It brings things into
          focus, you suddenly realize what's
          important in life.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Does anybody want seconds? Or
          should I bring out the desert?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'd love desert. What do you have?
          Do you have any ice cream or cake,
          or anything like that? I have a
          real big sweet tooth right now.
          Why don't we go into the kitchen
          and do an ice cream bar with kids
          right now? I've got a better idea,
          I make a really good milkshake. We
          should all go make milkshakes with
          the kids right now in the kitchen.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Do you know who might be able to
          help you? A Chinese doctor. Have
          you explored Eastern medicine at
          all?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Now's not the time to talk about

</b>          I'm trying to help the man.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No, I haven't.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Hey. I'm the last guy who would
          buy into that shit, but it works.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          He really is the last guy who would
          buy into that shit.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Our country's only two hundred
          years old. The Chinese have been
          around for thousand of years
          figuring this shit out. How I got
          into it, I had acid ref lux and
          nothing was working and then this
          guy at work turned me onto a
          Chinese doctor and he gave me some
          herbs that tasted like dogshit, but
          they worked.

<b>          LAURA
</b>
<b>          (NERVOUSLY)
</b>          I take herbs for my PMS. They
          really helped.

</b>          Daddy, you've been cursing a lot.
          You owe me a dollar for every

<b>          INGRID
</b>          This conversation is scaring me. I
          don't want George to die.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You girls can go play in the other
          room. The Chinese have a completely
          different way of looking at health.
          They don't think doctors should
          attack the diseases in the body,
          they're all about trying to support
          the body and make it stronger, so
          the body can fight off the disease.
          It works. I've seen it. I wish I
          could find a way to mass-market
          Chinese medicine in this country.
          Someone's gonna do it and make a
          fuck-load of money. Because these
          people get old, really old. You
          can't kill these people.

<b>          IRA

          Clarke laughs.

          getting the fuck out. I don't like

</b>          George, stop.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          That's what I hear. Can't say I
          watched that much 'Melrose Place'
          back in the day. She keeps telling
          me to watch the videos but, you
          know, I was never a big 'Party of
          Five' fan.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Well, I also ran a theatre company.
          And it was down to me and Cameron
          Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed
          a lot for our family.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Okay, if you say so.
          (a beat)
          The Mask was a funny fucking movie.
          You know what other movie Cameron
          Diaz was great in? 'There's
          Something About Mary.'
          Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and
          disrespect. They keep walking.

<b>          CLARKE (CONT'D)

<b>          LAURA
</b>          There's no pollution here like in
          LA so you can actually see the
          stars.

<b>          IRA
</b>          They are beautiful, but we have to
          get going. We have a really long
          drive to get back to Los Angeles.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You can't leave now, you won't get
          back until daylight. You should
          crash in the guest house. I'm sure
          it not as fancy pants as where you
          live, George, but it's better than
          driving all night or crashing at a
          hotel.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          We probably should get some rest

          us to our quarters, sir.

<b>          INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

          George sleeps on the bed. Ira sleeps on a couch across the
          room. The door slowly opens, Laura enters wearing a bathrobe.
          She walks to the bed and quietly slips under the covers,
          removing her bathrobe in the process. Without ever speaking,
          she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make
          love to him. George is surprised but not completely shocked
          and goes along happily with it.
          ANGLE ON: Ira, he never wakes up.

</b>          We really do need to get back. I
          have to visit my mom. I can't miss
          it. It's her birthday. Everyone
          in my family is coming in from
          across the country for it. She's
          turning 65. It's very important we
          get back for it.

          do that.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You know what? I think I do need
          to do that. One thing I learned in
          China from some Buddhist friends of
          mine is it's important to have an
          open heart, to live in the moment,
          and to speak the truth to each
          other. So I'd like to say to you,
          George, that it was a great
          pleasure to meet someone who had
          such a big impact on my wife's
          life. I really like you. And wish
          we had more time to get to know
          each other. And I wish you a

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yeah. My best friend Nancy grows
          this stuff on a hill by her house.
          You want some?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No, that stuff makes me paranoid.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Not me. It makes me feel sharper,
          Some people get tired, I get more
          energy, more clear.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What's happening?

</b>          What's happening? Whatever we want
          to happen is gonna happen now. I'm
          free. I'm fucking free.
          Laura gets up, kisses him.

</b>          We're free.

</b>
<b>          (NERVOUSLY)

          They start kissing again. She starts to moan loudly.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Not so loud, your kids are
          sleeping.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          A tank could roll through this

          Hey, Daisy. It's Ira.

<b>          DAISY (V.0.)
</b>          Oh. Ira. What's going on?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I just wanted to talk to you
          because I'm in the middle of a

          anyone I can talk about it with.
          My friends are all mad at me and
          George is kind of losing his mind.

<b>          DAISY (V.0.)
</b>          You can tell me, what is it?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Look, I know you think I have the
          moral code of some guy from the 50s
          like Dwight Eisenhower, but I'm
          with George and he's hitting on his
          ex-girlfriend who's married now and
          has kids and I don't know what to
          do. I'm kind of freaking out. I
          think I'm having a panic attack.

<b>          DAISY (V.0.)
</b>          Well don't have a panic attack,
          that's not going to help anything.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well telling me to not have a panic
          attack is not going to stop it.

<b>          DAISY (V.0.)
</b>          (screaming at the top of

<b>          DON'T HAVE A PANIC ATTACK!!!

</b>          Haha, very funny.

</b>          Seriously, what's going on?

</b>          Oh my god. Really? I mean, this

          more hours in them.

</b>
          George, Laura, Ira, and the kids are seated at a table. The
          kids are coloring with crayons.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          Look what I did. I want this hung
          up on the wall.
          She shows them the picture, which is clearly not appropriate
          for the wall: a picture of herself choking and dying.

<b>          MABLE (CONT'D)
</b>          The food here made me sick.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Mama, I have to go to the bathroom.
          Come wipe my butt.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I have to talk to them for a
          minute. Mable, go wipe your
          sister's butt.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          She can do it. She's almost six.
          That's weird.
          Ingrid and Mable walk off together.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I wet the bed til I was eleven. It
          wasn't even a mental thing. I just
          got relaxed when I was asleep.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I spoke to Clarke. He's going to
          fly back to China tonight. I was
          thinking about driving to the
          airport and meeting him there and
          telling him that when he comes
          back, he should find another place
          to live.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's great. Are you okay doing
          that?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Yes. It's what I want. I just
          need to figure out when we would
          move down to LA. It might be
          better to let the kids finish out
          the school year because I have to
          apply to the private schools in LA,
          and I don't know if I missed the
          deadline. Then I'd have to look
          into the charter schools.
          Sometimes these private schools, if
          you give them a donation, they let
          your kids in. Maybe you can stay
          up here for part of the year if I
          can't make it happen.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Sure. If I'm not shooting a movie,
          or on tour or something, that would
          be great.
          Laura leans in and kisses George. George is not big on
          public displays of affection. He kisses back, but you can
          tell that he's very uncomfortable.
          They hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly
          separate.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          I made her wipe her own butt.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          I did it, but I don't know if I did
          a good job.
          (to George)
          Look at what I drew. I drew a
          picture of you. Look? Show Mama.
          George holds it up. It is a picture of several people.

<b>          INGRID (CONT'D)
</b>          That's you. That's George. That's
          Mommy. And Daddy. And me. And
          Mable. That's all of us.
          We see the picture, and it is everybody holding hands.

<b>          INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY
</b>
          George and Ira are walking around a very small bookstore.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This is a small bookstore. They've
          only got one Philip Roth book.
          Didn't he write like fifty books?

<b>          IRA
</b>          So when are we going to go home?
          You're not talking at all about
          when we're going to go home.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She's going to talk to Clarke
          tonight, and then she's going to
          make a plan. We've got to get over
          that hurdle.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Are you okay with everything? This
          is happening pretty fast.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This is exactly what I wanted.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Okay.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I mean, she's cool, right?

<b>          IRA
</b>          She's nice. I don't really know
          her very well.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She was kind of cooler when I knew
          her back in the day. She's still
          hot, but she was crazy hot back
          then. Her attitude has changed a
          bit. With the kids and all. Back
          then she was really sexy, and all
          about fucking. I know she's busy
          with her life now, but it is a
          little different.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yeah, well when you have two kids
          and a husband, and horses and
          ducks, it's not all about fucking.

</b>          That's just the hormones of youth.
          I'm all about fucking. But I don't
          expect to be when I get older.
          I'll be occasionally about fucking,
          which is normal. The fact that
          you're all about fucking now is the
          weird thing.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Well hopefully everything will work
          out. If it doesn't, it just wasn't
          meant to be.

<b>          IRA
</b>          What does that mean?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It means I'm going to give it a
          shot. I'm excited, but I'm not
          going to really know if it works
          until we're in it. I hope I'm just
          not in love with the person she
          used to be.

<b>          IRA
</b>          She's about to leave her husband
          for good. She has two kids.
          You're not sure this is going to
          work?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          There's no way to ever be sure that
          anything's going to work! I
          couldn't live up here. She wants
          me to live up here. I don't think
          I can do it. Maybe a couple of
          weeks a year.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, she'll live with you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Do you think she means that she's
          going to bring the kids too?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Of course. What else would she do?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I don't know, don't some men get
          custody of the kids? Or they split
          the custody? I like the kids, but
          I've never lived with kids before.

          tolerate the young one. She's
          cute. Maybe they can split kids.

</b>          Where are you?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm getting cigarettes.

<b>          GEORGE (V.0.)
</b>          You've been gone for forty minutes.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I got lost. I don't know this
          town.

<b>          GEORGE (V.O.)
</b>          Well come back. I don't know how
          to take care of these kids, I'm not
          a camp counselor like you. These
          kids are on to me. The older one's
          too intense. She's troubled.
          She's like Damien, from the Omen.
          I need help.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Ok, I'll hurry back.

<b>          INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
</b>
          Ira runs around the airport, looking for Laura and Clarke.

<b>          INT. AIRPORT - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Laura is talking to Clarke, emotional. Clarke is crying.

<b>          CLARKS
</b>          I'm so sorry. This only happened
          because of me. It's all my fault.
          I made you feel terrible. I made
          you feel unsafe in our
          relationship. I'm so sorry.
          Please forgive me.
          Ira stands there, staring at them.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I'm sorry too. I love you so much.
          It was just a flirtation. It never
          went anywhere. It's just after you
          cheated on me, I felt so alone.
          And you were gone so often that I
          felt like our life doesn't work.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Then I have to make a change. I'll
          stop most of the traveling.
          There's nothing more important than
          you and the kids.
          Ira starts to turn to sneak away. Clarke sees him.

<b>          CLARKE (CONT'D)
</b>          Ira! What's going on? What are
          you doing here?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Oh, I'm just headed back to Los
          Angeles. I've got some spots at
          the Improv I've got to do this
          weekend.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          (under her breath)

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          You're headed back to Los Angeles?
          Then why are you at the
          International terminal?

<b>          IRA
</b>          This is the International terminal?
          I'm so confused, I've never been to
          this airport before.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Yeah, this is the Air China First
          Class Lounge.
          REVEAL that everyone else in the lounge is Chinese.

<b>           CLARKE (COIN' D )
</b>          What the fuck is going on? What
          the fuck is going on, Laura?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I don't know what to say.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Tel- me the truth ! Just tell me
          the tri.t_h.;_

<b>          LAURA
</b>          I came here to tell you that I
          wanted you to move out when you
          came home. But I realized this was
          a mistake, so I didn't say it.
          Please don't hold that against me.
          We've worked everything out.
          Everything is fine.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Who's watching the kids? Who's
          watching the fucking kids?

<b>          IRA
</b>          An adult is watching them.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Is George watching our fucking
          kids? I will kill him.
          Clarke runs off.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Uh oh.
          Ira runs out of the lounge. Laura runs out also.

<b>          INT. LAURA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          George with the kids. Oblivious to what is happening.

<b>          EXT. AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Ira comes back out, his car is about to be towed.

<b>          IRA
</b>          No, no, no! I'm here. I'm here.

<b>          INT./EXT. CLARKE'S CAR
</b>
          Clarke drives home, pissed off.

<b>          INT./EXT. LAURA'S SUV
</b>
          Laura drives home, quickly.

<b>          INT. IRA'S CAR
</b>
          Ira drives, in a panic, on his cell phone. The phone goes
          through to George's voice mail.

<b>          IRA
</b>          George! Clarke is coming back to
          the house. He knows everything!
          I'm coming to get you. Be at the
          end of the driveway. No! Be at
          the next driveway over! To the
          north!

<b>          EXT./INT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT
</b>
          Clarke arrives at the house. He sees George sitting with
          the kids.

          room?

<b>          MABLE
</b>          Are you two going to fight?

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Ye s.

<b>          EXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          George and Clarke walk outside. Clarke puts up his fists,
          ready to fight.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She's not happy.
          Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts
          style.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          No one who's married is fucking
          happy. Leave us alone! You fucked
          up. You fucked it up with her a
          long time ago. Let it go or I will
          kill you. I will literally kill
          you till you're fucking dead. That
          disease didn't kill you. But I
          will kill you.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You shouldn't joke about my
          disease. That was very serious.
          Very scary.
          Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like
          martial arts hits.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          What the hell is that?
          Ira arrives. George starts yelling at Ira.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't jump in. Whatever you do,
          don't jump in. I don't want your

<b>          IRA
</b>          Okay.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You said you were getting
          cigarettes then you ran to the
          airport to stop her. What kind of
          friend are you?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I am a good friend because this
          entire situation is crazy. You are
          out of control.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I didn't deserve what you did to
          me. You betrayed me !

<b>          IRA
</b>          When I got there, she was already
          kissing him. I never even had a
          chance to stop it. I didn't get to
          do anything!

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Don't pretend you're fucking mad at
          each other, just to distract me so
          I won't beat your ass.
          Clarke pushes George.

<b>          CLARKE (CONT'D)
</b>          You're gonna come to my house?
          You're gonna come to my fucking
          house? You have to get your own
          life. Leave us the fuck alone.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Don't hit me! I've been sick!
          They don't know. The medicine is
          working now, but I'm still sick.
          Clarke punches George.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          (to Ira)
          What are you doing? I said to jump
          in!

<b>          IRA
</b>          You told me not to jump in.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          129.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          That's what "don't jump in" means.
          It means "jump in." Help me!
          Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          You're a terrible fighter.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I know, that's why I became a
          comedian, because everyone used to
          beat me up!
          George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard,
          sending him to the floor. Then Ira takes a run at him and
          Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet.
          Laura runs into the middle of the scene.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Laura, tell Clarke to stop!

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Clarke, please don't do this.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Don't tell me what I can and can
          not do.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Laura, tell him. Tell him you want
          to be with me now.
          Laura doesn't answer.

<b>          GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Laura?

<b>          LAURA
</b>          Why did you have to come here and
          confuse me? Everything was fine
          before you came here. Now
          everything is all screwed up.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Laura, what's it going to be? Are
          you going with him, or are you
          going with me?
          Laura looks at Clarke.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          LAURA
</b>          With him.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Don't do this.

<b>          LAURA
</b>          You fucked up my life. And now I
          fucked up yours. But just a
          little. Probably just for a day.
          She walks back into the house.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Hit the road before I put you
          through another round.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You cheated on her too!

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Yeah, but we're married. We're
          going to work through this shit.
          You should have waited until you
          were married to cheat. It buys
          you another chance.
          Clarke punches George. Ira is on the ground. He doesn't get
          up.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          She told me I was the love of her
          life. And she loves me more than
          she loves you!

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          When she said that, did she think
          you were dying?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Yeah!

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Too bad you had to 'Live and find
          out it wasn't true. Leave my
          fucking family alone!
          Clarke punches him. George gets a punch in but it doesn't
          hurt Clarke. Clarke punches him again.

<b>          CLARKE (CONT'D)
</b>          I can do this all night.

<b>

<b>          131.
</b>          Clarke hits George again. Ira leaps on Clarke and now all
          three are on the ground rolling around, arms flailing.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          (to Ira)
          Stop Ira, you're hitting me too.
          Mable and Ingrid appear outside.

<b>          MABLE
</b>          What are you guys doing?

<b>          INGRID
</b>          What's happening?
          The three look at the kids and instantly feel awful.

<b>          IRA
</b>          We're just playing that's all.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          We're wrestling. It's fun.

<b>          CLARKS
</b>          Boys like to wrestle just like
          girls.
          They all start wrestling some more, but this time it is fake
          playful. They give each other noogies, and tickle each other
          so the kids won't be scared.
          A little blood runs off of George's face.

<b>          INGRID
</b>          Are you bleeding?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No. We were just painting. I got
          some paint on my cheek.

<b>          CLARKE
</b>          Come on girls. Let's go inside.
          Mable and Ingrid run inside. Clarke turns to George.

<b>          CLARKE (CONT'D)
</b>          You know what sucks about this? I
          like your movies and now I can't

          Clarke goes inside.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That was meaner than him punching
          you. That is a demented
          motherfucker.
          George punches Ira in the face. Ira fires back two punches
          at George's face and he stumbles back.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          None of you fuckers can hurt me.
          George pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the
          ground for a moment. Ira makes his-way free and gets up.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Get the hell off of me you psycho.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What about you? You are just a

<b>          IRA
</b>          I am not responsible for you. You

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Lacky.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          It's not a job, you're a tacky.
          You're not even that fucking funny.
          This gets Ira very mad.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Who cares? If being funny means
          being like you, I rather be a
          little less funny.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Mission accomplished.

<b>          IRA
</b>          You're the only person I know who

          brought out what a prick you are,
          brought everything bad to the

          George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed.

          Music up: Ted Hawkins' song "Strange Conversation."
          Ira drives George home in the dark. Neither one speaks.
          We see images of different cities going by the window. Ira
          thinks about all he's been through and the challenges ahead,

<b>          EXT. GUYS' APARTMENT
</b>
          Ira pulls up to his apartment.

<b>          IRA
</b>          okay, I'm getting out. You have to
          drive yourself home. I'm getting
          out here.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Why didn't you drive me to my
          house?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Because then I'd still have your
          car.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You'll drop it off later.

<b>          IRA
</b>          There is no later! I'm not going
          to ever talk to you again. So I
          don't want your car.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          So that's how it's going to be.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</b>
          George enters. There is an enormous pile of stuff to do on
          his dining room table. Several stacks of scripts. One pile
          has a big post-it note that says: "READ THESE!"

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</b>
          George lies alone in bed, alone. Eyes wide open. It's
          really bright in his room.
          George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The
          room goes dark.
          Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV
          to go to sleep. It's the Today show. It's really happy and
          morning-themed. The piece on the Today show is very suburban.
          "How to Clean Up Clutter."

          Ira is talking to Leo.

<b>          LEO
</b>          We rented out your room to Jay.
          But you can crash on the couch if
          you want.

</b>          Oh man, you got jerked off on that

</b>          Thanks. I'm sorry, I lost my way
          for a while.

<b>          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</b>
          George reads one from a large pack of scripts. A few pages
          in, he clearly doesn't like it. He puts it down, picks up
          another one.
          The large stack is clearly the ones he doesn't like.

<b>          INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
          Ira writes at a table.

<b>          EXT. STORE - DAY
</b>
          George walks out of a store. A beautiful woman tries to chat
          him up, but he lets her know he i.s"busy and has to go. He
          walks off. She looks disappointed.

<b>          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          Ira talks to Daisy. They seem to be getting along well.

          Daisy is performing on stage. She gets off and heads over to
          Ira.

          She kisses him.

<b>          MANAGER
</b>          Hey Ira, Federman got in a car
          accident. Do you want to take his
          spot?
          George walks over with a young comedian of about Ira's age.
          This young man has clearly taken his place.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Hey, how's it going?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Hey George.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          This is Randy. He's funny, you'd
          like his stuff. It's smart.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm sure I would. I look forward
          to seeing it. Are you going on
          tonight?

<b>          RANDY
</b>          I hope so.

<b>          MANAGER
</b>          (to George)
          Do you want to go up? Ira was
          gonna take Federman's spot, but we
          can get you up if you want to?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          No, that's ok. I don't want to
          take Ira's spot. I'm just gonna
          hang out tonight.

<b>          INT. IMPROVISATION - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Ira is introduced. He walks onto the stage. We see George
          walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a
          table by himself.
          On stage Ira does his act. He is much more comfortable than
          we have ever seen him on stage before. He is no longer
          searching for his comic identity. He has found a way to be
          himself on stage, and tells jokes which are more personal
          than we have seen before.
          Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not
          seem thrown. Sometimes he seems amused.

<b>          ANGLE ON GEORGE
</b>          He watches from the back of the room. At first he does not
          laugh, but then slowly starts laughing--but more at the
          things Ira does in between jokes. We can tell that he is
          proud of Ira and misses him.

<b>          INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY
</b>
          Ira is back behind the counter, working at the Deli with
          Chuck and Gail. He doesn't look too unhappy to be there.

<b>          FEMALE CUSTOMER
</b>          Is the potato salad fresh?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I made it myself this morning.

<b>          FEMALE CUSTOMER
</b>          Is it good?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I stake my reputation on it.

<b>          FEMALE CUSTOMER
</b>          Okay. Give me a quart.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would
          like a quarf'of potato salad.
          The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal
          George standing there, holding his ticket.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Do you have any turkey that's
          hormone-free?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yes we do.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          So this is where you work.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Back in the saddle.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I thought we were writing a
          screenplay.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Well, you're not a very good
          writing partner.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Or any kind of partner. You want
          to make me a turkey sandwich and
          talk to me? They give you breaks
          around here?

<b>          INT. SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          There is a small seating area in the supermarket where people
          eat food at the deli counter. George and Ira sit across from
          each other.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          In my travels, I have learned a lot
          about Asia and Buddhism. And I
          would like to be in the moment now
          with you, and to tell you how sorry
          I am, and how much I have
          appreciated your friendship. And
          even if we are not friends in the
          future, I wish you well on your
          journey.
          Ira laughs.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That guy was a douche-bag.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          But also kind of cool. It's a very
          weird combination.

<b>          IRA
</b>          He was going to heal you with those
          herbs, man. You get sick again,
          you should call that guy.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I think most of what you said to me
          was true. And I really am sorry.
          I think I'm still not very
          healthy...in my brain.

<b>          IRA
</b>          It's all right, man. You've been

          help me. Even though it was kind
          of an impossible task.

<b>          IRA
</b>          Is everything going okay? How are
          you doing?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          I am not doing well, but things
          have certainly been worse. So, I
          will be fine.

<b>          (THEN)
</b>          You were good the other night. I
          hear you're getting regular spots
          now.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I'm actually going up tonight.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Really? Any new jokes you're
          working on?

<b>          IRA
</b>          Yeah, I've been trying to get off
          my ass and do some writing.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          What do you got?
          Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never
          asked this before.

<b>          IRA
</b>          I was thinking about doing a bit
          about how I'm not very good
          looking, but I'm not bad looking,
          but I'm just good-looking enough
          that if I had a good personality,
          it might put me over the top.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You should do something about how,
          when you date a girl, and you feel
          really good and she likes you, and
          then you see pictures of all her ex-
          boyfriends, and they're all really
          goofy-looking guys, and it's not
          that you're good looking, it's just
          that in this psychotic girl's eyes,
          you're good looking?

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          141,
</b>
<b>          IRA
</b>          And how all of her boyfriends look
          like Lou Costello.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Why don't you say Dom Deluise?
          it's a more current reference.

<b>          IRA
</b>          More current? What year was
          Cannonball Run, 1978?

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          Okay, okay. What else you got?

<b>          IRA
</b>          I was going to talk about how I
          haven't had sex in so long, that I
          can't even remember my previous
          sexual experiences so I can
          masturbate to them.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You should say, now when I
          masturbate, I have to think about
          the last time I masturbated.

<b>          IRA
</b>          That's a good one. You can write.

<b>          GEORGE
</b>          You know, I always wanted to be
          part of the comedy field.
          As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes
          for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in
          the entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we...
