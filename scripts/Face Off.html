<b>     FADE INTO:
</b>
<b>     SEPIA-TONE FOOTAGE
</b>
     of a pig chasing a lion chasing a dinosaur chasing an
     elephant.  Noah's Ark going round... and round... and
     round...


<b>     EXT. GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL - DAY
</b>
     Disjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and
     fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal:

     JON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus.  On the adjacent
     unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5).  Clutching a balloon,
     Matty waves at his dad.  A happy moment, like so many
     certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching
     them THROUGH...


<b>     SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES
</b>
     wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the
     target.  They round the bend and disappear...


<b>     MATTHEW
</b>
     Loses his grip on the unicorn.  Archer reaches over and
     pulls him into his lap.  They happily ride together...

     As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer...

     Now we see the sniper.  CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient,
     aggressive, sexual.  His finger closes around the
     trigger.

     BOOM!  A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back.  Bleeding... he
     drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the
     carousel.  His eyes desperately searching... searching...
     searching... until he sees --

     Matthew lies on his back -- still.  Slowly, Archer
     reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see
     COLOR for the first time...

     Blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son...

     TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full
     color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating
     away.

     HANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS:


<b>     FBI BRIEFING ROOM
</b>
     Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below
     is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his
     eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession.


<b>     CAROUSEL HORSE
</b>
     sweeps by, as if marking time itself...


<b>     HOLY PLACE
</b>
     Smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden
     cross.  A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer.  The
     glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a
     light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb.  This
     is no chapel... but an atrium.  Somewhere.

     And as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's
     Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device.


<b>     ANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE
</b>
     sweeps by...


<b>     ARCHER
</b>
     pockets his FBI badge, then holsters his gun...


<b>     CASTOR
</b>
     sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in
     front of it.  Totally hidden.


<b>     BRIEFING ROOM - CASTOR'S MUGSHOT
</b>
     is on a computer screen.  His criminal dossier scrolls by
     endlessly:  bombings, assassinations, mercenary
     kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire...

     Rookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully.  Other
     agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid-
     maps, man phones, etc. amid the take-out cartons and
     coffee cups.  These people are on high alert.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Any follow-up from L.A.P.D.
               Intelligence?

<b>                             BUZZ
</b>               No, sir, nothing yet.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Get them on the phone -- now.
               What about S.I.S. and our airport
               teams?

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               We've had everything from psychics
               to satellites on this.  Even if
               Castor was here... he must have
               slipped the net by now...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               He's here!  And we're going to
               keep looking until we find him!

     A silence descends on the chastised team.  As they go
     back to work, veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer
     aside.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Jon, these people have been
               working round the clock -- you
               gotta cut them some slack...

     Archer considers his best friend's advice -- then...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I'll cut them some slack when I
               cut myself some slack.

     Archer marches out -- slamming the door behind him.


<b>     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MORNING)
</b>
     Castor quietly shuts the security door behind him.  An
     Hispanic voice startles him.

<b>                             JANITOR
</b>               What are you doing?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>                      (in perfect Spanish)
               Thank goodness, I feel like Icarus
               in the labyrinth -- where's the
               men's room?

<b>                             JANITOR
</b>                      (in Spanish)
               This area is off limits, Padre.
                      (re:  security door)
               How did you get in that room?

     Realizing the JANITOR is already too suspicious, Castor
     puts a priestly arm around him -- and leads him down the
     hall.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Okay... I have a confession to
               make, but you aren't gonna like
               it.  I was planting a bomb.

<b>                             JANITOR
</b>               Bomb?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               You know -- boom --
                      (patting his
                       neck)
               Oh, never mind...

     The Janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his
     head.  As he gasps his last -- Castor heaves him down a
     stairwell.  Now we see the needle-thin custom stiletto in
     Castor's hand.

     Castor kicks the Janitor's mop and bucket down the stairs
     -- making everything look like an accident.


<b>     INT. SAME BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - DAY (MORNING)
</b>
     The children's church choir -- 200 strong -- sing "Behold
     the Lamb of God."  Clergy and lay persons listen
     reverently.

     "Father" Castor strolls by the singers -- casually
     heading for the exit.  As he passes the risers, a teenage
     girl drops her sheet music at his feet.

     Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close he's
     practically licking it.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I've never enjoyed 'The Messiah.'
               But your voice makes even a hack
               like Handel seem like a genius.

     He pats her behind and leaves.  Although a little shaken,
     she's also drawn by Castor's sexual magnetism.


<b>     EXT. LA CONVENTION CENTER - DAY (MORNING)
</b>
     The marquee proclaims:  INTERNATIONAL CHURCH CHOIRS 18th-
     21st:  AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.

     Castor exits -- politely holding the door for a beat cop.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY (MORNING)
</b>
     The office is a monument to obsession:  photographs,
     clues, newsclips, totems of Castor Troy surround a pacing
     Archer.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>                      (on phone)
               ... I don't have time to get a
               warrant from some hung-over judge.
               Just give me the go-ahead, Victor,
               and I promise -- as soon as this
               is over -- you can brand my butt
               with the Fourth Amendment.

     The instant Archer hangs up -- the INTERCOM BUZZES.

<b>                             KIM (V.O.)
</b>               Sir, your wife's on line one...
               S.I.S. on two...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Tell her to hang on --

     As Archer punches up line two -- Tito bursts in.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               A jet was chartered at Anderson
               Airfield.  Guess who just showed
               up to pay for it?  Pollux Troy.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Scramble the Reaction Team --
               we're moving out.  And get one of
               our people on that plane.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               But there's still no sign of
               Castor...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Where one brother goes, the
               other's sure to follow...

     They rush our... the hold button on line 1 still
     blinking.


<b>     EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</b>
     A sleek Cadillac pulls in... stopping next to a Land
     Rover.

     LARS MUELLER -- a muscular, crystal-eyed jar-head -- gets
     out of the Caddy.  An instant later -- LUNT MUELLER --
     emerges from the Rover.  They are identical twins.

     The men scan the airport carefully, then open the rear
     doors of their respective vehicles.  Castor emerges from
     the Caddy -- Armani clad.

     Exiting the Rover is Castor's younger brother POLLUX TROY
     -- skittish, brilliant, paranoid -- a human hummingbird.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               You're 26 minutes late.  The
               casing didn't fit -- right?  I
               knew that cheap-shit Dietrich
               would rip us off...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Oh, God -- !

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               What!?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I forgot to turn the damn thing
               on!

<b>                              POLLUX
</b>               You're kidding, right?
                      (to the twins)
               He's kidding...
                      (grabs Castor
                       by throat)
               ... are you fucking kidding!?

     Castor hugs Pollux lovingly.  Pollux squirms like a kid.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Bro -- everything went fine.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               I hate when you call me bro.

     Pollux heads for the jet.  Castor hands Lunt a wad of
     cash.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Thanks for babysitting.

<b>                             LUNT
</b>               Anything else?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I'll contact you when we get the
               rest of the money.
                      (turns to leave)
               Oh, and stat away from downtown.
               The inversion layer's going to be
               pretty thick around the 18th.

     The twins nod... then take off.  Castor heads for the
     jet.


<b>     INT. JET - DAY
</b>
     Castor hustles in -- exhorting the PILOT.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Let's go, let's go!

     As the JET TURBINES start to WHINE, Castor sinks into his
     seat.  A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him
     a Scotch.  He downs it, looking her over salaciously.

<b>                             FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>               Would you like anything else?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Hell, yes...
                      (pulls her into lap)
               It's the only way to fly.

     She smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its
     taxi down the runway.


<b>     COCKPIT
</b>
     Castor yanks open the door.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What's wrong?


<b>     AT END OF RUNWAY
</b>
     A squat car creeps INTO VIEW -- blocking the runway.


<b>     EXT./INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY
</b>
     Behind the wheel is Jon Archer.  Beside him is Tito.


<b>     BACK TO ARCHER
</b>
<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               It's Archer.
                      (gun to Pilot's
                       head)
               Go, dammit!

     Suddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castor's hand.  he turns
     around to see... the Flight Attendant behind them --
     holding a smoking pistol.  This is Agent WINTERS.

<b>                             WINTERS
</b>               F.B.I.!  Throttle down, captain!

     But Castor elbows the throttle up.  The jet lurches
     forward, throwing Winters off balance.  Pollux tackles
     her as the jet picks up speed.


<b>     INT. HUMVEE - DAY
</b>
     Archer slams the vehicle into gear.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Get out.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               You're not playing chicken with
               two tons of aluminum...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Get out!

     Tito obeys as Archer peels out.  The HUMMER ROARS at the
     jet.

     The jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft.

     The humvee is aimed right at it... Archer's eyes narrow.


<b>     COLLISION COURSE
</b>
     as two hunks of metal bear down.  The machines are
     seconds apart when --

     Archer looks up to see...

     Winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window,
     Castor holding a gun to her head.

     Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet.  The
     Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but 
     too late.  Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a 
     swirl of dust.

     As the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens.  Castor
     blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the
     tarmac.


<b>     INSIDE
</b>
     Castor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until...

     KA-CHUNK:  Something POUNDS the jet -- from above.
     Castor leans out the hatch and sees...

     The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls.

     Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men.

     Castor BLASTS at him from the open hatch.

     The chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs.  Archer jerks
     and weaves -- dodging the BULLETS.  The chopper pulls
     away.

     The jet finally lifts off... when...

     The chopper settles on the jet -- slamming at its tail.


<b>     TARMAC
</b>
     Tito reacts to this madness -- as the chopper plays a 
     deadly game of leap-frog with the jet.

     The end of the runway is coming up fast.

     Archer crushes the jet's horizontal elevator flap.


<b>     JET PILOT
</b>
     can't budge the jet's jammed yoke.  Thwarted, he powers
     back the throttle.  Thrust reverse.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What are you doing?

<b>                             PILOT
</b>               The horizontal elevator's smashed!
               We can't lift off!


<b>     CASTOR
</b>
     SHOOTS the Pilot -- then takes the controls.  He
     struggles to maneuver the jet.  Suddenly...

     A biplane descends right at them -- about to land.


<b>     ARCHER
</b>
     pulls up just as the JET swerves radically to avoid the
     biplane and SLAMS into the hangar.


<b>     JET
</b>
     plows through the GLASS DOOR, the NOSE-WHEEL SNAPS off.
     The PLANE SKIDS right into the hangar -- finally stopping
     at the wings.


<b>     FBI CHOPPER
</b>
     lands.  Archer steps out calmly -- like a cop about to 
     write a traffic ticket.  He hurries to join more FBI 
     agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him.


<b>     INT. HANGAR - DAY
</b>
     The jet hatch pops open -- Castor leaps from it, FIRING.

     Two FBI agents drop -- riddled.

     Pollux appears at the hatch -- an FBI sharpshooter FIRES,
     grazing Pollux's shoulder.  Staggered, Pollux falls --

     Castor catches him before he hits the floor --
     simultaneously BLASTING the sharpshooter.

     Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar.

     Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his
     anger building.  He signals Tito and the others to spread
     out.


<b>     DEEP IN HANGAR
</b>
     A maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery.  Led by
     Archer, the FBI agents pick their way through it.

     ROOKIE LOOMIS snaps alert -- did he see something?
     Advancing carefully, he comes up on...

     Castor -- staunching Pollux's shoulder wound.  Pollux
     sees the agent -- and FIRES.

     Loomis hits the floor -- his bleeding ear is shredded.

     Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux.

     Tito is at the wheel.  Castor FIRES -- forcing Tito to
     dive off.  The forklift careens on -- driving apart the
     brothers.

     The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning
     Pollux.  Castor tries to free his trapped brother.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Forget it -- Go!  Go!

     He slaps his Glock into Pollux's hand.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Wherever they put you, I'll find a
               way to get you out...

     Pollux starts FIRING -- covering Castor as he runs
     through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar.

     Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's
     head.  As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               -- not unless you want that 200
               I.Q. splattered all over the
               floor.
                      (as Archer
                       approaches)
               We got him now, Jon.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               That's what you always say.  Seal
               it off.  I'm going in.

     Archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel.

     MUSIC as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse
     dance.

     Sensing Archer, Castor pauses by an old landing gear.  He
     draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on.

     Archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy
     movements mirroring Castor's.

     Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze
     trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers.
     The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in.

     Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering
     the challenge.  As the deadly beat between them
     continues --

     BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS
     FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead.

     INTERCUT as necessary:

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed
               by your obsessive need to spoil my
               fun.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               And how much will your 'fun' net
               you this time?

     BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning.
     A moment later, Archer pursues... SNAP!  He fits a new
     CLIP into his pistol.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What's it to you?  I declare it.
               Here I am, back in the States for
               less than a week --

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You're under arrest.  Incredibly,
               you still have the right to remain
               silent --

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I've got something going down on
               the eighteenth... it's gonna be
               worse than anything God ever
               dumped on the Pharaoh.  I'll give
               it up -- but my brother and I have
               to walk.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               No discussion -- no deals.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What're you gonna do with me
               locked up?  You'll drive your wife
               and kid nuts!  I bet your daughter
               is just about ripe by now.  What's
               her name, Janie?

     Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw
     his enemy out.  Silence -- then Archer senses...

     Castor is behind him.  He FIRES -- Archer dives away.
     The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two
     huge turbine engines.  As Archer reloads, he stares at
     the control panel switches.

     Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP-
     SNAP.  Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two
     switches.

     VRRRROOOM!  The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on!  Unable to fight
     the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted
     across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall.

     The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Tell me he didn't get away
               again...

     Then Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless
     body.  Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile
     survives.


<b>     EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - SUNSET
</b>
     Heavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded
     into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Where's my brother?!  I want to
               see my brother!

     The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, 
     flanked by two bodyguards.  Bullying through the media,
     Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the
     devastation.

     Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded
     on the ambulance.  A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               The oversight committee would've
               roasted us for this one -- thank
               God it paid off.  Damn fine work.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Real fine, Victor.  Especially the
               casualties.

     Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three
     bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked.
     Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the
     bodies.

     Instinctively, the two men close ranks.  Archer grabs the
     Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               Classified information.  No
               photographs.

     Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and
     leads him away from the media... and the carnage.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               You okay, Jon?
                      (off Archer's nod)
               Then go home.  Tell Eve.


<b>     EXT.  ARCHER'S HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET
</b>
     A renovated Craftsman.  Sipping a carton of milk, Archer
     pulls into the driveway.  He sits, gathering his
     thoughts.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer enters and sees his wife EVE.  Handsome,
     intelligent.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Hi...
                      (no response)
               ... What's wrong?

     She nods toward the KITCHEN.  JAMIE is there -- a sullen 
     and hard fifteen-year-old.  There are cigarette cartons
     on the table.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               She complimented for her 'F' in
               history with an 'A' in
               shoplifting...

     Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of
     Marlboros.  Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Nice stunt, Jamie.  You break the
               law and I'm expected to ignore it?

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               That's right -- it's all about
               you.  Don't even ask me what
               happened.

     Archer looks to Eve for help.  Eve shakes her head --
     nope.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Okay.  What happened?

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               Like you'd ever fucking believe
               me!

     She bolts.  In anticipation, Eve calmly opens the door as
     Jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Well, you tried.  You failed
               miserably, but you tried.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Why won't she even talk to me?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Maybe because you taught her never
               to speak to strangers.
                      (immediately
                       regrets it)
               I'm sorry... that wasn't fair.

     Eve kisses his cheek -- then gathers up her doctor gear.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I've got patients waiting.  Try
               again, Jon.  She hates you -- but
               she needs you.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Eve...

     Something in Archer's expression makes her stop.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jon -- what is it?

     But he's too overcome.  He starts to speak -- but can't.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Is it -- him?  It's... it's over?

     Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks 
     up.  Eve pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them 
     both.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I'm going to make everything up to
               you and Jamie.  I'll put in for a
               desk job.  We'll go away, get
               counseling -- anything you want.
               This time, I mean it.


<b>     INT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT
</b>
     Freshly dressed, Archer heads down the hall.  He pauses 
     at the door to Jamie's room when he sees -- Jamie.

     Fully clothed, she's fast asleep on her bed cluttered
     with clothes and assorted girl-stuff.  Her face peaceful.

     Archer looks around her room... sees the stuffed animals 
     collecting dust... replaced by makeup, jewelry, beefcake
     Calvin Klein ads and band posters, etc.

     Archer's startled to see a lacey bustier... his little 
     girl is growing up fast.  And he's missing it.

     He pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out.
     The instant he leaves, Jamie kicks the blankets off.


<b>     INT. FBI BUILDING - DAY
</b>
     Dominated by the FBI seal.  Archer steps to the check
     point.

<b>                             SECURITY GUARD
</b>               Print, please.

     Archer presses his thumb to a scan-pad -- and is cleared.


<b>     INT.  BULL PEN - DAY
</b>
     Efficient as a beehive -- agents, cryptologists, support 
     staff buzz at their routines.  Archer strides through -- 
     drawing congratulatory nods and "thumbs up" signs...


<b>     OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE
</b>
     Archer's team is there.  Applauding.  Proud.  Uneasy with 
     plaudits, he disperses the disappointed agents.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Much appreciated.  Now let's get
               back to work, okay?

<b>                             WANDA
</b>                      (to Buzz)
               Is that stick ever gonna fall out
               of his ass?

     Archer's well-built secretary -- KIM BREWSTER -- hands
     him his messages.  She's holding a bottle of Dom
     Perignon.

<b>                             KIMBERLY
</b>               The C.I.A. sent this over.  What

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Send it back and tell them to stop
               wasting the taxpayers' money.
               Anything else, Miss Brewster?

<b>                             KIMBERLY
</b>               No, sir.

     He enters his office.  Kimberly sighs and turns to Wanda.

<b>                             KIMBERLY
</b>               Four years -- and he still calls
               me 'Miss Brewster.'


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Sitting at his computer -- Archer scrolls through
     Castor's file.  He grimly contemplates face-after-face of
     Troy's victims -- finally pausing on a photo of his son
     Matthew.

     Burying his feeling, he types "CASE CLOSED" over
     Castor's image.  Archer starts to press "enter" when Tito
     comes in.

<b>                             ARCHER

<b>                             TITO

               going to be okay.  That's the good
               news...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Go on.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               ... Brodie and Miller from Special
               Ops need to see you.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I don't have time for those cloak
               and dagger guys.

     Big NED BRODIE and athletic female HOLLIS MILLER stroll
     in.

<b>                             BRODIE
</b>               You better make time, Jon.

               We found this in the jet wreckage
               -- among Pollux Troy's effects...

     Archer accedes as Miller pops in the disk.  The computer
     screen displays a CAD schematic of the bomb.  Archer
     studies it carefully -- unease growing.

     frustrated interrogators on the run.

     Archer, Lazarro, Tito, Brodie, Miller and other FBI
     officials watch the monitor.  Pollux remains implacable

               That bomb was just a crossword
               puzzle to me... a mental exercise.
               I never built it...

     Lazarro shuts down the monitor... turns to Archer.

<b>                             ARCHER

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Pollux is a manipulative
               psychopath.  He can control his

               blood pressure...

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               Jon, I trust your instincts, I
               always have.  But D.C. wants more
               evidence.  And frankly, so do I.

<b>                             ARCHER

     Archer looks at the gathered brass.  He knows it's 
     hopeless.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               That bomb has been built, it's out

<b>     INT. HOAG'S SURGICAL BAY - DAY
</b>
     Loomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away
     charred flesh around his burned ear.  The doctor turns to
     a --


<b>     STEREO-LITHOGRAPHIC MACHINE
</b>
     Laser-beams attack an organic soup with incredible
     precision.  The light forces a chemical reaction -- and 
     out of the soup -- an ear begins to form.  It rises from 
     the liquid, now fully-formed.  The surgeon takes the ear 
     and fits it in place on Loomis's head.  He starts 
     suturing.


<b>     OBSERVATION BOOTH - ABOVE
</b>
     Archer, Hoag, Brodie and Miller watch the operation --
     video-enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls.

               inflammatories, healing is
               accelerated from weeks to days.
               By his next paycheck, he won't
               even remember which ear he lost.
                      (a beat)
               Your situation, however, would be
               a little less permanent...

<b>                             BRODIE
</b>               -- and a lot more classified.

     Hoag holds up a face-sized organic shell made up of
     yellow cartilage pieces and tendons, etc.  Archer pulls
     it over his face -- like a gauze mask.  A "tendon" falls
     off.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               This'll fool Pollux.

               be built to match the exact shape
               of your skull; the outside --
               exactly like Castor's.  Then we
               fit his face right on top --

<b>                             MILLER
</b>               -- and you become him.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You're talking about removing the
               guy's face?

<b>                             BRODIE
</b>               Borrowing, Jon.  The procedure's
               completely reversible.

</b>               One way or the other -- the
               mission ends on the eighteenth.

     Archer turns the shell over and over and over in his
     hands.

<b>                             BRODIE
</b>               You know Castor better than
               anyone.  You've lived and breathed
               him for years -- hell, you even
               look a little like him.

     Archer shoves the template back at Hoag.

<b>                             ARCHER

</b>               If you don't do this -- Castor
               will beat us again.  He'll beat
               you again...

     Archer pushes his way past them -- and marches out.

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               I don't think that went very well.

<b>     INT. INTERROGATION BOOTHS - DAY
</b>
     Archer enters... sizes up DIETRICH HASSLER.  His stylish
     garb doesn't completely hide his criminal roots.  Archer
     sits down calmly.  He looks at his watch.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I'm in a hurry, Dietrich.  So
               you've only got ten seconds to go
               through your usual litany of lies,
               empty threats, and moronic
               denials.  Then I'm coming over
               there --

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               If you're in such a fucking hurry
               -- why are you wasting your time
               with me?  I'm just an art dealer.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You're a dealer, all right:
               technical secrets, munitions...
               explosives.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               You've never proven any of that.
               And when my bitchy, never-been-
               laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here,
               she's going to...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Time's up.

     Archer topples the wooden table and tears a leg from the
     top.  Brandishing it -- he stalks the startled thug.


<b>     HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
     Lazarro blanches as an obsessed Archer repeatedly slams
     the table leg against the wall -- above Dietrich's head.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               The only ticking bomb I see is
               inside his head.  He's getting
               worse, Tito.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Don't worry, sir.  It's all an
               act...

     But as Lazarro leaves -- we see Tito's worried, too.


<b>     BACK INSIDE BOOTH
</b>
     Archer has a terrified Dietrich backed into the corner.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               ... Okay!  Castor called me but I
               blew him off... I swear I never
               saw him.  And I don't know
               anything about any bomb!


<b>     INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION BOOTHS - SAME TIME
</b>
     Archer emerges... eyes blazing.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Let him go, but I want him
               watched... Who's next?

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Just Dietrich's sister...

     In another booth, a careworn but striking woman sits with
     a little boy on her lap.  She gently helps him Crayola a
     book.  This is SASHA HASSLER (30) and her son ADAM (5).


<b>     INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY
</b>
     Archer hovers over Sasha -- her maternal warmth replaced
     by an icy hatred.  Tito and the child are gone.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               When was the last time you saw
               Castor Troy?

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Who cares?  He's dead.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Answer the question.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Look, I'm clean.  I teach kids
               now --

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Sasha -- you are a felon, on
               probation for harboring Castor
               Troy.  So it's in your best
               interest to cooperate.
                      (as she's silent)
               Would you like your son put in a
               foster home?

     Sasha's eyes flash, her body coils -- but she keeps
     control.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               No, but I'm sure you'd love it --
               you sick bastard.

<b>                             ARCHER

               When was the last time you saw
               Castor Troy?

     She stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               I haven't seen him for years.


<b>     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
     Archer watches as Adam leaves Dietrich and jumps into 
     Sasha's arms.  She hugs him protectively.  Adam sees
     Archer watching them -- and smiles.  Archer doesn't smile
     back.

</b>

<b>     INT. I.C.U. - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer slowly circles Castor's muscular, hairy, tattooed
     body.  Although on life support -- his signature smirk
     remains.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               What about Lazarro?

<b>                             BRODIE
</b>               No way -- the red tape alone would
               take a month.  This is a black-bag
               operation -- completely off the
               books.

<b>                             MILLER
</b>               If you need him, Tito can help you
               prepare.  But you know the drill:
               You can't tell anyone -- not the
               Director, not your wife... nobody.

     Archer's face shows he doesn't like it -- then he nods.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I'm in.


<b>     EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer slowly gets out of his car.  Trudging toward the
     front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot.
     His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile.


<b>     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer passes Jamie's room.  Loud MUSIC POUNDS from 
     within.  He pauses to knock, thinks again, then heads
     down the hall.


<b>     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Eve is in bed.  Archer comes in quietly and sits beside 
     her -- studying her peaceful, sleeping face.  She stirs.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I was dreaming...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Something good?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I'm not sure... you were flying
               this weird old stunt plane...
               doing flips... walking on the
               wings... I was watching from the
               ground -- when you fell.  You had
               a parachute, but you wouldn't open
               it.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Did you catch me?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               No.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               How come?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I don't know...
                      (nuzzles him)
               Maybe because you've never needed
               my help.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Come on, you made that up, didn't
               you?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               ... Maybe I did...
                      (teasing)
               ... maybe I didn't...

     They kiss affectionately.  Passion building, Eve runs her 
     hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round
     scar on his chest.  Archer freezes -- mid-caress.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               It's all right, Jon.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               After all these years, I still
               can't get it out of my head -- an
               inch to the left, Matty would
               still be alive.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               And you wouldn't be.

     No response.  The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Things will get better now that
               you're home.  Everything will be
               better -- now that... that man is
               finally out of our lives.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Eve...

     He starts to say the words.  He wants, needs to share the
     truth with her.  But he can't.  Instead --

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               ... If I had to do something to
               find some closure... I should do
               it, shouldn't I?... No matter how
               crazy?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Oh, God -- you're going on
               assignment again...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               One last time.  And while I'm
               gone, I want you and Jamie to go
               to your mother's.  It's
               important...

<b>                             EVE
</b>               You said you'd be here!  You
               promised!  What could be more
               important than that?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I can't tell you... except only I
               can do it.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               You want me to tell you it's okay

     Fury erupting, Eve pushes Archer out of the bed.


<b>     INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer enters a child's room -- neat and tidy, like a 
     museum exhibit.  A starfield of glow-letters twinkles
     faintly.

     He lies down on the bed and toys with his wedding band --
     staring up at the words the stars form... "MATTHEW."

     Tito drives into the Hoag compound.

     Archer's beside him, juggling Castor's dossier:
     documents, photos, etc.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Jon, this is goddam insane.  You

     Archer says nothing... it's too late for debate.  Tito
     parks.  The men get out and head for the lab.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               You haven't got a chance in hell
               of fooling Pollux.  Castor drinks,
               smokes and walks around with a 24-
               hour hard-on.  He's nothing like
               you --

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Don't worry... If Hoag can do half
               what he claims, I'll get Pollux to
               talk.

     Archer reaches for the door -- Tito stops him.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               It's not that simple, Jon...
               Becoming another person --
               especially him -- nobody can come
               all the way back from that... not
               even you.

     Archer considers his friend's words... He toys with, then
     removes, his wedding bang.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Keep this for me.

     As Tito takes the ring -- a caring, but concerned look
     passes between the two friends.



<b>     INT. SURGICAL BAY - DAY
</b>
     Two huge video screens are dominated by the CG-images of
     Archer and Castor.  As Hoag briefs the team, the CG-
     images glow to reflect the physical characteristic Hoag
     refers to.

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               Let's walk through it, Jon.  Your
               blood types are different, but we
               can't do anything about that.
               Otherwise, nature is cooperating
               nicely.  The height difference is
               negligible -- within 1/2 an inch.
               Eye color -- almost a perfect
               match.  Penis size, flaccid,
               essentially the same --
               Substantial.

     From the observation booth above -- Miller (flanked by
     Tito and Brodie) raises his eyebrow.

     On the video screens, the images morph to signify the
     physical augmentations.

               the body hair... the teeth will be
               bonded to match Castor's...

     Hoag eyes Castor's inert, tight body -- then turns to
     Archer -- prodding his love handles like a livestock
     inspector.

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               How about an abdominoplasty?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Abdomino -- what?

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               A tummy tuck.  On the house.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Do it.


<b>     TRANSFORMATION MONTAGE
</b>
     (INTERCUT huge video screen enlargements of Archer and
     Castor's body parts as necessary):

     Globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off Archer's 
     obliques.  At the same time...

     Hoag recreates the "Great Sphinx" tattoo on Archer's
     thigh.  We PUSH IN ON his leg, then PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     Archer and Tito.  The CLOSE UP on his leg becomes a FULL
     SHOT as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself.
     Tito demonstrated the proper "Castor gait": dangerously
     casual, like a panther.

     Hoag reproduces Castor's fingerprints... then layers them
     over Archer's fingers.

     Archer practices Castor's icy, killer glare.  Tito hands
     him a lit cigarette.  Archer brings the cigarette to his
     lips -- then coughs harshly.  But he keeps trying.

     Castor smiles... then smirks and laughs.  PULL BACK to
     reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on
     a monitor-screen -- mimicking him.

     Archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin
     spots.  Giving  up, he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting
     the zipper caught in his new chest hair.


<b>     EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - GROUNDS - DAY
</b>
     Tito tosses a pistol.  Archer catches it with his right
     hand.  But to Archer's surprise, Tito frowns.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Nice catch.  But you used the
               wrong hand.

     He takes the pistol away -- and slaps it in Archer's left
     hand.  Then Tito shoves him -- challengingly.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Shoot me.
                      (as Archer
                       doesn't move)
               Shoot me!

     Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               You want to be Castor Troy?  If
               you hesitate for a breath, you're
               finished!  Now -- shoot me!  Kill
               me!

     Archer holds the gun unsteadily.  Tito is disgusted.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               You can't do it... because Castor
               is tougher than you...

     BOOM!  The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's
     head.  Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's
     still there.

     Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination.


<b>     EXT. HOAG'S FACILITY - NIGHT
</b>
     Clear and calm.  God's night.  Someone's God anyway.


<b>     INT. I.C.U. ROOM - NIGHT

     Hoag leads Archer to a full-length mirror.

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               Let's see if I missed anything
               before I get my hands really dirty.

     Archer removes the robe.  He's amazed to see:

     His own head on Castor's body:  a flat stomach, hairy
     chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc.  Hoag touches
     Archer's scar.

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               You realize this has to be
               removed.
                      (as Archer
                       slowly nods)
               Then here we go, Commander.
               Through the Looking Glass...


<b>     INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT
</b>
     Unconscious, Archer is wheeled into the surgical bay, 
     Castor beside him.  Hoag turns to the video technician.

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               Make sure you get everything --
               I'll need to study the tape before
               the reverse surgery.

     Hoag lowers an aerated Plexiglas mask over Archer's face.
     Interwoven with integrated laser circuitry -- this Derma-
     Induction-Device (D.I.D.) attaches via suction.

     Hoag sights through the optical memory, squeezes the
     trigger.  A cobalt beam cuts around the face -- cleanly
     slicing it.  Then Hoag lifts Archer's face -- off of his
     skull.

     Brodie and Miller watch from above.  Tito stumbles into
     the nearby bathroom to throw up.

     Hoag inspects Archer's face, then turns to his nurse.

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               Vault it.

     Hoag turns to perform the same procedure on Castor.

     Castor's consistent EEG reading suddenly spikes
     radically -- for a moment, it almost seems to stabilize.
     Hoag glances over -- too late -- the spikes have 
     disappeared.

     But the CAMERA CLOSES IN ON Castor's ear -- and we sense
     that, somehow, his auditory nerves might be functioning.

<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:

<b>     INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
     A head swathed in gauze.  The bandages start to fall 
     away.

     Tito, Miller and Brodie wait as Hoag removes the gauze.
     The patient looks into a mirror.

     Jon Archer has become Castor Troy.

     he touches his new face.  Archer stares... the cold
     reality chilling his blood.

     Archer buckles -- unprepared emotionally for what he's
     done to himself.  For a moment, he seems to teeter on
     madness.

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Jon -- are you all right?

     Archer can't respond... he's somewhere the others can't
     comprehend.  Finally he emerges... shaken, but in
     control.

     TITO enters.  Instinctively, he grabs for his holster.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Okay... I'm okay.
                      (realizes)
               But my voice... I still sound like
               me.

<b>                             HOAG
</b>               I implanted a micro-chip onto your
               larynx.

     Hoag SWITCHES ON an AUDIO TAPE.  Archer repeats Castor's
     words as Hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box.

<b>               CASTOR (V.O.)                  ARCHER
</b>       Okay, I've got a               Okay, I've got a

       you aren't gonna like          you aren't gonna like
       it... (etc.)                   it... (etc.)

     After a few repetitions, Archer's voice matches
     perfectly.

     Archer yawns, squints and furrows his brow -- testing 
     every muscle.  He stares into the mirror -- into the eyes
     of his most hated enemy -- now his eyes.  Archer slowly 
     turns to...

     Castor.  Motionless, swathed, dead to the world -- but
     something about Castor's smile -- that mocking smile...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Now what?

<b>                             TITO
</b>               We're down to 72 hours.  Let's
               call Lazarro.  Castor Troy just
               came out of his coma.


<b>     EXT. FBI HELIPORT - DAY
</b>
     Armed agents take their positions around a helipad.  A 
     jet-black helicopter drops from the sky like an angry 
     wasp.


<b>     EXT. HELIPAD - DAY
</b>
     As Lazarro watches -- Tito escorts out a heavily-manacled 
     "Castor."  Two armed agents leap from the chopper and 
     take charge of "Castor."  He follows them pliantly,
     until --

<b>                             TITO
</b>               Watch this hard-case -- he'll bite
               your nuts off if he gets the
               chance!

     Archer gets the message.  He starts to resist the agents 
     and must be muscled into the chopper.  He's manacled 
     down.

     Eye contact between Archer and Tito -- both aware of this 
     very real point of departure.  The CHOPPER DOOR SLAMS
     SHUT.  It lifts off like a twister and SCREAMS away.


<b>     EXT. HELIPORT - STAGING AREA - DAY
</b>
     The watching team breaks up, wanders back to work.

<b>                             LOOMIS
</b>               What a week for Archer to go on a
               training op.  Maybe we should try
               to contact him.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               Forget it.  He's knee-deep in
               Georgia swamp by now.

     They pass Brodie and Miller, who watch the chopper 
     disappear over the horizon.  So far so good.     


<b>     INT. CHOPPER - FLYING - DAY
</b>
     The agent re-checks Archer's chains.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Don't forget -- I ordered a kosher
               meal...

     The agent smashes his elbow into Archer's gut.  The 
     second agent presses an INJECTOR against Archer's leg.
     PSSSST.  Archer spasms against the drug -- then sags
     unconscious.


<b>     INT. EREWHON PRISON - DELOUSING CUBICLE
</b>
     Archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him.

     A guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate.

     Archer lies gasping on the steel floor, protecting his
     face.  The spray stops -- when head guard "RED" WALTON
     enters.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               You are now an Erewhon inmate -- a
               citizen of nowhere.  Human rights
               zealots, the Geneva convention and
               the P.C. police have no authority
               here.  You have no right...
                      (slaps on latex gloves)
               When I say your ass belongs to me
               -- I mean it.  Bend over.

     Archer's face reflects the degradation as he bends over
     and exposes all to the cavity-searching Guard.

     Satisfied, Walton lets Archer dress.  Another guard
     places a pair of odd-looking steel boots before Archer.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               Step into them.

     Archer inspects the lock-down boots.  Hinged steel
     collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle.  The
     soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               Don't sniff 'em, you perv.  Just
               step into them.

     Archer obeys.  A guard squats down and locks the steel
     collars over Archer's shoes.  He tries to move -- but
     can't.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               They're too tight.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth
               shut.

     Walton JOLTS Archer with his HIGH-VOLTAGE SHOCK-STICK.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               The prison's one big magnetic
               field.  The boots'll tell us where
               you are -- every second of the
               day.
                      (into comm-link)
               201 to Population.

     Walton presses his thumb into a standard FBI scan-pad.
     It forms a print -- positively identifying the guard.
     The heavy blast-door automatically opens.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               I've got fifty bucks says you're
               dead by dinner.  Don't disappoint
               me.

     Walton prods Archer toward the door.  To Archer's
     surprise -- he can now move.


<b>     INT. GENERAL POPULATION - DAY
</b>
     The inmates eat.  Silence descends as Archer enters --
     intensifying the constant HUMMING of the MAGNETIC FIELD.
     Huge Dubov does a slow burn on seeing "Castor."

     Scanning the room for Pollux -- Archer takes a seat next
     to a LITTLE, GOATEED MAN with a French accent.

<b>                             LITTLE MAN
</b>               Hey, Castor -- remember me?

<b>                             ARCHER

                      (catches himself)
               -- I believe Jon Archer busted you
               for poisoning five members of the
               the Canadian parliament?

<b>                             VOISINE (LITTLE MAN)
</b>               Those scumbags should never have

                      (a beat)
               We heard you got wasted.

     Archer sees the other inmates sizing him up.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Do I look wasted -- asshole?

     Voisine shakes his head "no" -- then his eyes widen as...

     WHAM.  Dubov leaps onto Archer and starts pummeling him.
     They slide across the table -- spilling everyone's lunch.

<b>                             GUARD

</b>                      (into comm-unit)
               Hold that lock down.

     Walton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room.
     Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling
     inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed.

     Especially his "brother" Pollux -- who watches
     uncertainly.

     Dubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready.  He grabs
     Dubov's fist -- just before it hits his face.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Never -- in -- the -- face.

     Holding Dubov's fist firmly, Archer kicks Dubov
     repeatedly in the groin.  Metal boot meeting soft flesh.

     Dubov staggers back -- hurt.  Archer moves in for the
     kill, savoring it.

     Walton looks skyward.

<b>                             WALTON

     The two deputies react to Walton's call.  Identifying
     Archer and Dubov's signature-blips -- they throw the
     appropriate switches and...

     ZAP!  The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor.  
     Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archer's just out of 
     reach.

     Crack!  Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               What?  He started it!

     Walton smashes Archer harder -- he hits the floor.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               When I get out of here --

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I'm going to have you fired.

     His statement is so ludicrous, Walton laughs.  Everyone 
     does.  From the inmates' reactions, Archer knows he's 
     been accepted.

<b>                             WALTON

               Back to your 'suites' -- or no
               dinner.

     As Archer drops into the line of cons -- he spots Pollux
     waiting for him.  Girding himself for this first 
     encounter -- he's got a plan.

<b>                             POLLUX

</b>               Of course it's Pollux, what the

     Archer stares -- feigning confusion until Walton prods 
     him forward.  Pollux watches his "brother" go -- very 
     concerned.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S CELL - NIGHT

     Isolated, lonely, he realizes how easy it would be to go 
     insane here.


<b>     EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT

     An insanely starry night.  Van Gogh's night.  The night 
     he cut off his ear, anyway.


<b>     INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT
</b>
     Castor's body lies inert.  His life-support MACHINES
     BLIPPING away.  Until the EEG spikes.  Once -- twice -- 
     three times.  Brain wave activity increases -- and 
     stabilizes.

     Castor's fingers twitch.  Then his fist clenches -- hard.  
     Castor's head is swathed in gauze.  But his eyes pop 
     open.

     Reflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out 
     the tubes and wires that tether him to life support.  He 
     goes down -- in agony -- groaning.

     He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab --
     until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in
     the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze.

     The discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see
     what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE...
     then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his
     cool.

     Finally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the
     phone and he dials.

     Lars and Lunt hustle Hoag in.  The lab is on.  The

     tape.

     Lars shoves Hoag into a towering figure... we ZOOM IN ON
     Hoag's glasses.  And THROUGH the REFLECTION we see...


<b>     MAN WITHOUT FACE
</b>
     Hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle, cartilage and
     bone.  The man lifts a cigarette to his lips... then 
     exhales.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What do you think I want?


<b>     INT. PRISON - POPULATION - DAY
</b>
     A huge wall-screen plays gentle nature scenes.  Below --
     the inmates engage in their exercise hour.

     Voisine stares at the screen -- while Pollux carefully 
     watches his "brother" play basketball.  Archer tosses up 
     an air-ball to the jeers of other inmates.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               You realize, of course, that
               magnetic humming is designed to
               drive us insane.  If we all don't
               get brain tumors first.

<b>                              VOISINE
</b>               And that same cloying Bambi tape
               -- over and over...

<b>                              POLLUX
</b>               It's like they're begging us to
               riot.  Where the fuck are we,
               anyway?
                      (the game ends)
               Gotta go...

     Pollux trots over to Archer -- passes him his cigarette.
     He studies Archer as he takes a drag -- and nearly gags.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               ... I'm worried about you.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Why?

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Your jumpshot has no arc.  You
               used to swagger... now you swish.
               You're gumming that butt like a
               Catholic school girl.
                      (notices)
               And why do you keep picking at
               your finger?

     Pollux has caught Archer reflexively tugging at his
     phantom wedding ring.  Archer immediately stops.  He
     takes a drag and holds it -- then exhales right in
     Pollux's face.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I was in a coma...

     Pollux sticks his finger under Archer's eye and pulls 
     down like a vet examining a sick dog.  Archer pushes him 
     off.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               My reflexes, my senses, my
               memory... everything's jumbled.  I
               can't even tell you why Dubov
               jumped me yesterday.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               You Pollinated his wife the day he
               was arrested.  How could forget
               that?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I've forgotten plenty.  Look
               around -- we've screwed over half
               the freaks in here.  What's gonna
               happen to us if they think I've
               lost it?

     Pollux contemplates the other inmates -- circling, sizing
     up the brothers like hungry sharks.  Instinctively,
     Pollux moves closer to Archer for protection.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I need you to play big brother for
               once -- till I can fill in a few
               blanks.  Think you can handle
               that?

     Pollux nods grimly -- then Archer pulls up his sleeve,
     exposing the pyramid tattoo.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I know I got this on my tenth
               birthday.  I just can't remember
               why.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Man -- that was the worst day of
               our lives!

     Archer feigns a "struggle" with his memory.  He lights a
     new butt with the old -- chain-style... then "remembers."

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Oh, God -- Mom O-D'd at County
               General.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Retching and convulsing while
               those bastards didn't even try to
               save her sorry ass.  You gave her
               mouth to mouth -- man -- even then
               you had some constitution.
                      (a beat)
               Remember what you swore to me at
               the funeral?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Uh -- to kill the doctors?

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               After that.  You promised you'd
               always take care of me.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               And I bet I kept that promise...

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Only one you've never broken.

     Pollux curls into Archer -- in need of comfort.  Archer
     puts an affectionate arm around Pollux -- springing the
     trap.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Screw the past.  We've got the
               future to look forward to.
                      (a beat)
               We still have tomorrow.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               No shit... five million bucks...
               now those Red Militia crackpots
               get to keep it.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               That's not the worst part.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               What's worse than losing five
               million bucks?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Being stuck in this rat-hole when
               it blows.  What you built was a
               work of art.  It belongs in the
               Smithsonian.

     Pollux beams with pride -- Archer hangs on every word.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Yeah -- well... the L.A.
               Convention Center will have to
               do...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Thanks, Pollux.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               'Thanks'?  I guess they really did
               fuck you up.

     Then Archer smiles -- like Jon Archer.  Without knowing
     exactly why -- a wave of ill-ease overtakes Pollux.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S CELL - DAY
</b>
     Archer paces impatiently... as the door rolls open.
     Walton is looking at him with cool respect.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               You have a visitor.

     Archer smiles to himself -- pleased at Brodie's
     timeliness.


<b>     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Archer's boots lock down -- as the guillotine door rises.
     But his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror.  
     Because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of --

     Jon Archer.  This man has Archer's face -- his real face.

<b>                             IMPOSTOR
</b>               What's the matter?  Don't you like
               the new me?

     Archer studies the image of his former self -- trying to
     understand.  Then he recognizes the smirk on the face, 
     the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he 
     cannot say...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               -- Castor...?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Not anymore.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               It can't be.  It's impossible.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used
               was 'titanically remote'.  Who
               knows?  Maybe the trauma of having
               my face cut off pulled me out.  Or
               maybe God really is on my side
               after all.
                      (starts pacing)
               By the way, I know you don't get
               the papers in here.

     Continuing to circle, he displays the current LA Times:

         "INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead"

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Terrible tragedy.
               Hoag was such a genius -- but
               selfish with his artistry.  I
               actually had to torture his
               assistants to convince him to
               perform the same surgery on me.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You killed them?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Of course I killed them, you dumb
               fuck.  Hoag, his staff...

     FLASH ON Hoag's body -- on the floor of the burning lab.
     Two more burned bodies adjoin Hoag's.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Miller and Brodie --

     FLASH ON Brodie and Miller -- dead in a mangled car
     wreck.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I even paid a visit to your buddy
               Tito.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               He doesn't know anything about
               this!

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Come on, Jon.  I think I know you
               better than that.  I only wish you
               could have been there to see the
               look on his face --

     FLASH ON Tito... he smiles, then recoils in shock as
     Castor lifts a pistol and shoots him... then he picks up
     Archer's wedding band off the counter...


<b>     INT. EREWHON PRISON (PRESENT)
</b>
     Archer stares -- thunderstruck -- at the wedding band now
     on Castor's finger.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               -- then again, I guess you were
               there.
                      (a beat)
               I torched every shred of evidence
               that proves who you are.  So
               swallow this -- you are going to
               be in here for the rest of your
               life.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Castor, don't do this --

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               No discussion, Jon -- no deals.
               Now if you'll excuse me, I've got
               an important government job to
               abuse, and a beautiful wife to
               fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean 'make
               love to.'

     Archer freaks out.  He screams, flails -- unable to reach
     Castor.  Castor opens the door and guards rush in --
     clubbing Archer and shocking him senseless.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               Sorry, sir.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               It's quite all right.  You never
               know what to expect from a
               psychopathic criminal...


<b>     INT. CELL BLOCK - DAY
</b>
     The guards dump Archer into his cell.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               Better be nice, Castor.  You could
               get mighty lonely now that Pollux
               is gone.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Pollux is -- what?

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               Archer cut him a deal for turning
               state's evidence.  He's been
               released...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Walton, you have to listen to me
               -- right now!

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               Or what?  You'll have me fired?
                      (pushes a button)
               You're confined until I say
               otherwise...

     The steel panels shut - silencing Archer's pleading
     voice.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY
</b>
     Sipping a beer, Castor cruises past the suburban bliss:
     men on hammocks; women chatting; kids playing tag.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>                      (sickened)
               Jesus, what a life.

     Castor tries to catch a street address and rolls past...


<b>     ARCHER'S HOUSE
</b>
     Dressed for work, Eve watches blandly as the car goes by.
     A moment later, it backs up and parks.

     Hiding the beer can, Castor forces a sheepish smile --
     and gets out.  She doesn't smile back.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I suppose it was only a matter of
               time before you forgot where we
               lived.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Sorry -- the job's been murder
               lately.

     Castor looks her over -- she's much sexier than he 
     expected.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               So what happened to your
               'important' assignment?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What do you know about it?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I know exactly what you always
               tell me:  Absolutely nothing.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               It didn't work out the way
               everyone thought it would.  Where
               are you off to?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I've got surgery.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Surgery -- are you okay?

     Then he spots her medical bag.  Oops.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Don't try to charm me -- I'm still
               angry.  There're leftovers in the
               fridge.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Have fun at work.

     Castor kisses her good-bye -- on the mouth.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               What is with you?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Don't I usually kiss my wife?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               No.

     Castor reacts as she gets in the car and pulls out.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Castor steps inside, looks around.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What a dump.


<b>     INT. STUDY - DAY
</b>
     Castor sifts through Christmas cards from holidays past,
     studying the ones with photos.  He's memorizing -- 
     matching names to faces -- Wanda's, Buzz's, Lazarro's, 
     etc.

     Something else catches his eye.  He finds a floral
     notebook -- Eve's diary -- and pages through it.  Then,
     he reads:

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               '... "Date-night" has been a
               typical failure... we haven't made
               love in almost two months...'
               What a loser ...

     Castor hears a voice.  Glancing across the hall, he
     sees...


<b>     GLIMPSES OF JAMIE
</b>
     As she walks back and forth in her room, talking on the
     phone -- and wearing only panties and a cropped T-shirt.
     Castor steps closer -- enjoying the view.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               The plot thickens.


<b>     INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Jamie stamps out her cigarette.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               -- I got your E-mail, Karl.  That

                      (spots Castor
                       at door)
               Hang on a sec...

     She slams it -- but he gets his foot inside.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               I'll call you back.
                      (to Castor)
               You're not respecting my
               boundaries.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I'm coming in, Janie.

     Castor pushes menacingly into the room.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               'Janie'?

     Castor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow.  
     He gazes seductively -- unnerving Jamie as he steps 
     toward her.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I don't think you heard me...
               Jamie... You have something I
               want ...

     He reaches for her -- and right past her.  He picks up a
     pack of cigarettes from the desk.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               Clarissa left those here.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>                      (shrugs and
                       lights up)
               I won't tell mom if you don't.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               When did you start smoking?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               You'll be seeing a lot of changes
               around here --
                      (blows a perfect
                       smoke ring)
               Daddy's a new man.

     Jamie stares, astonished, as Castor goes out.


<b>     INT. EREWHON PRISON - ARCHER'S CELL
</b>
     Fists bloody, voice hoarse, Archer pounds at the cell
     door.  Exhausted, he finally stops -- staring at the face
     of his enemy in the mirrored door -- the enemy who now
     has total command of his life.


<b>     INT. FBI - LOBBY CHECKPOINT - DAY
</b>
     Castor dons his stern "Archer" face as the gate guard
     checks his thumbprint ID.  He's cleared and waved in.


<b>     INT. FBI INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY
</b>
     Buzz and Wanda watch Pollux through the two-way mirror.
     He's gorging himself on a big lunch.  Castor arrives.

<b>                             BUZZ
</b>               Listen, sir... we just want you to
               know...

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               We're all really sorry about
               Tito...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Yeah, well, shit happens.

     Buzz and Wanda exchange a glance.  To them, "Archer" is
     just avoiding his feelings again.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               How's our star witness?

<b>                             BUZZ
</b>               He hasn't told us a damn thing
               except what kind of mustard he
               likes on his tongue sandwiches.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               If that bomb is out there -- we're
               almost out of time.

<b>                             LAZARRO (O.S.)
</b>               Archer!

     Lazarro stomps toward them... furious.  Buzz and Wanda
     quickly excuse themselves.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               You made a deal with Pollux Troy?
               He's 'a manipulative psychopath.'
               Your own words, Jon!

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Just let me do my job, Victor.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               The job I've been protecting for
               the last eight years.  From now
               on, you go strictly by the book.
               Everything gets cleared by me.
               Understand?

     Lazarro stomps off.  Castor watches him go, wheels
     turning.


<b>     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Castor enters -- shutting down the mikes... and the
     blinds.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               You're supposed to be snitching --
               making me look good.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               'Look good'?
                      (drops food in
                       disgust)
               Seeing that face -- I want to
               vomit.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I'm the one who has to look at
               this butt-ugly mug every time I
               pass a mirror.  Look at my eyes,
               my chin, my perfect nose -- gone!
                      (considers his
                       reflection)
               Archer took my life, so I'm taking
               his.  Bro, I'm going straight.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Sounds like they took your brain,
               too?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar
               Hoover.  Carlos the Jackal running
               Interpol.  Kaddafi heading the
               Mossad.  Think of the secrets we
               could sell...

     Pollux listens carefully -- mind clicking like an abacus.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               The drug agents we could expose.
               The movie stars we could
               blackmail!

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               That's just the bottom of the food
               chain.  Pollux -- what would
               happen if somebody planted a bomb
               on Air Force One?

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               ... that somebody would get rich.
               And, I suppose, the nation would
               be pretty pissed-off.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking
               for someone to step in, take
               charge, give them hope again.
               What if that someone was an F.B.I.
               hero?  A true Boy Scout and family
               man -- with a spotless past.
               Imagine where that guy could land
               -- if the timing's right.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               It's an audacious dream, Caz.  But
               Jon Archer is hardly a household
               name.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Not yet he isn't.  But after you
               'confess' -- you'll be a free man.
               And I'll be on my way...


<b>     EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

     Police VEHICLES ROAR into position.  Squads of police
     evacuate throngs of people.


<b>     INT. CONVENTION CENTER - SUB-BASEMENT - EXTREME
</b><b>     CLOSEUP - BOMB TIMER - DAY
</b>
     TICKS down to less than two minutes.

     Working as a unit, the BOMB SQUAD carefully remove the
     bomb's casing.  Inside, the complex guts glow evilly.
     The men are tense, cautious -- and way out of their 
     league.

<b>                             BOMB LEADER
</b>               Jesus... Any suggestions?

<b>                             TECHNICIAN

     Castor pushes up his blast visor.  He looks grim.

<b>                             BOMB LEADER
</b>               It's protected by a vibration

<b>                             CASTOR

</b>               Sir, you can't disarm it --

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Just go!

     The bomb squad hustles out.  Waiting until he's alone,
     Castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its
     switch.  The bomb's glow dies instantly.


<b>     EXTREME CLOSEUP - TIMER
</b>
     stops at 26 seconds.


<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     Not satisfied, Castor starts it up again -- running the
     timer down to four seconds.  That's better.

     Jeers from the inmates as the big screen changes from the
     nature loop to... CNN.

     "Sweating," Castor lumbers out, carrying the disarmed

               Agent Jon Archer disarmed a

               the latest from Valerie Rice...

     Castor basks in the attention of the gathered media.

<b>                             REPORTER RICE
</b>               The apparent target was a group of
               Supreme Court justices -- due to
               speak here today.
                      (thrusting microphone)
               Mr. Archer, do you have any idea
               who planted it?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               That's classified.  But if he's

               him:
                      (directly into
                       camera)
               Nice try.  Now you know who's
               really in charge.


<b>     INT. EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION

     Watching the TV, Archer's enraged, frustrated.  Then his 
     eyes focus... he watches closely as --

     A guard uses his "thumbprint ID" to get through the 
     security door.  Archer's eyes fall on the thumbprint scan
     pad.


<b>     INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY
</b>
     Castor gets a "thumbs up" from some co-workers, others
     smile -- but they know better than to applaud.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Don't you guys watch TV?  Where's
               the parade?

     They look at each other -- afraid.  But proud rookie 
     Loomis starts clapping, so everyone else joins in rousing 
     applause.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               -- Loomis, Buzz, uh -- Wanda...
               all of you, thanks from the bottom
               of my heart.  Thanks for enduring
               all those years I was an
               insufferable boor.  From now on --
               consider me reborn.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               Stop the presses -- Jon Archer
               found a personality...

     Wild applause... interrupted by an excited Kim.

<b>                             KIM
</b>               Sir... the White House is calling.

     Castor acts startled... as if at a loss.  Then he struts
     toward his office -- pausing only to give Kim a playful
     swat on the rump.  She's stunned.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Castor surveys his new domain.  He settles into Archer's
     big leather chair... sees a framed photo of Archer and
     family.  He apes Archer's dumb posed smile...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Jon, your career is finally taking
               of.
                      (picks up phone)
               Archer.  Sure I'll hold...

     Waiting, he picks up a handbook:  You and the FBI:  A
     Primer for New Employees.  Then...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Mr. President, what an honor...

     Castor pumps a "whacking off" gesture with his hand.


<b>     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - DAY
</b>
     Castor, carrying grocery bags, comes into the back yard 
     where Jamie practices free throws.  He watches her miss.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               How about a game of horse?

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               Don't make me beat your butt

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Afraid you'll lose?

     Castor crisply sinks a free-throw.  Jamie glares, takes
     the ball -- and tosses an air-ball.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b><b>               'H.'

     Jamie sneers at him.  He buries another one.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Try putting a higher arc on the
               ball... and square your shoulders
               to the basket.

     Begrudgingly, she listens -- and sinks a clean shot.
     Pleased, she nods.  HONK!  A BMW pulls into the driveway.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               Gotta go.  Karl's here.

     Jamie trots over to greet KARL (17) -- a clean-cut
     preppie.  Opening the car door dor her, Karl waves,
     smiling at Castor.  Castor studies Karl carefully, not
     liking what he sees.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT

     A tired Eve opens the door.  It's pitch black inside.  As
     she fumbles for the light switch...


<b>     MATCH

     flares as Castor lights a candle.  The dining room table
     is set for a candlelight dinner.  He smiles warmly at her
     confusion.

<b>                             CASTOR

</b>               Why do I feel like I'm on a blind

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               It's important to keep some
               mystery... so things stay...
               unpredictable.

     Eve studies him as he pours her more wine.  Her smile
     slowly fades as she realizes what's going on.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               'Unpredictable'?  You're about as

<b>                             CASTOR

               leave.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I bet I deserved that.  I bet Jon
               Archer is the most inattentive,
               sexless spouse on Earth.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jon, that's not true --

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Of course it's true, but I'm
               trying to change?  I'm here
               because I want to be alone with
               you.  I want to see the candle-
               light dance in your beautiful --

     Uh-oh.  Castor can't tell the color of Eve's eyes.  He 
     leans in "romantically" -- but we know the real reason.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               -- brown eyes.

     He smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin.  She's
     aroused, but wary.  So Castor goes in for the kill.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I wanted it all to be just
               right... when I told you about my
               promotion.

<b>                             EVE

               Lazarro's getting old -- he won't
               be around forever.  And I'm
               getting the itch to move up.

<b>     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Castor carries Eve into the shower and spins on the 
     water.

     He rips her blouse open -- on her like a vulture to 
     carrion.  As they drop to the floor of the stall -- water 
     filling up around them -- Castor licks her ear and
     whispers...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               baby, it's like I'm having you for

     Dirty water runs down a floor drain... PULL BACK to:

     Desolate, Archer mops down the rec area.

<b>                             ARCHER

<b>                             VOISINE

               they send the real hard-cases for
               attitude adjustment.  Dubov just
               got sent down -- and look at
               Wainwright --

     Voisine gestures to a dazed inmate nearby -- WAINWRIGHT
     -- who sits in a corner -- gnawing at his knuckles.

<b>                             VOISINE
</b>               Toughest bastard I ever saw --
               after you, of course.  Now he's a

<b>                             ARCHER

<b>                             VOISINE
</b>               He hit a guard.

     Archer sees Walton hovering nearby.  Archer heads for
     him.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               Looking for trouble, Castor?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               As a matter of fact -- yes.

     Crack!  Archer decks Walton.


<b>     INT. PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT
</b>
     Walton and a guard herd Archer toward a steel door.


<b>     INT. "CLINIC" - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer is dumped on the floor.  He sees he's lying in a
     puddle of something.  He looks up -- and recoils.

<b>     ARCHER'S POV - DUBOV
</b>
     is strapped to a vertical gurney -- post-procedure.  His 
     limbs are stiff, his eyes blank as a mako shark's.  But 
     his feet are bare -- bootless.

<b>                             MED-TECH
</b>               Where's the mop, he puked all over
               the place.

     An assistant unstraps Dubov and drops him on a gurney.

<b>                             MED-TECH
</b>                      (mopping up)
               -- next time, bring them in before
               dinner...

     Archer cases the place:  Above is a catwalk... leading
     out.


<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     Walton muscles Archer into the gurney.  The Med-Tech 
     smirks.

<b>                             MED-TECH
</b>               Oh happy day -- Castor Troy.

     The Med-Tech wheels the ECT head-gear cart into place: 
     twin needle-like BOLTS ready to fit into ARCHER'S ears.  
     A single blue static spark jumps from the bolts.

     Walton roughly wedges Archer's head into the head gear,
     shoving the chewed-up bite strap into Archer's mouth.

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               Bite hard, scumbag, 'cause you'll
               be gumming baby food from here on
               out.

<b>                             MED-TECH
</b>               Get his boots, Sergeant.

     Walton unlocks Archer's first boot and pulls it off.  As
     the Med-Tech starts to fasten Archer's arm -- Walton 
     unlocks and pulls off the second boot.

     Archer's feet are free.  Crack!  He yanks his foot up 
     hard -- Walton reels back, stunned.

     One arm still restrained, Archer backrolls in the gurney 
     and kicks the head-gear cart away -- knocking it into the 
     Med-Tech who collapses onto it, hitting "Test" --

     ZAP!  The HEAD-BOLTS FIRE, catching the Med-Tech through 
     the shoulder -- he drops to the floor, his synapses shot.

     Seeing that Archer is still restrained by the arm -- the
     assistant darts out of the room.

     As Archer pulls free -- Walton looms over him -- gun
     poised.

     Then -- wham!  Dubov wallops Walton -- using his boots as
     brass knuckles.  The head guard collapses.

     Dubov smiles dumbly at Archer -- all trace of vendetta
     now obliterated.  Archer nods gratefully -- they're on
     the same team... at least for now.

     Suddenly the ALARM BLARES.

     Archer sees guards charging the room.  He tries closing
     the door -- but the guards arrive.  Dubov lumbers over
     and puts his massive weight into it -- and slams the door
     shut.

     O.S., guards POUND at the now-locked door.

     Archer quickly frisks Walton -- coming up with a
     cigarette lighter.  he pockets it.

     Scanning around -- Archer leaps onto a mounted, hinged
     lamp.  it swings against the wall.  Archer uses it to
     reach the catwalk above.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Dubov -- come on!

     Dubov obeys and follows Archer up onto the catwalk.

     A groggy Walton muscles open the door from inside.  
     Guards pour in.  Walton grabs an AUTO-RIFLE and opens 
<b>     FIRE.
</b>
     SLUGS chase Archer and Dubov as they flee through the
     catwalk door.


<b>     INT. CENTRAL SECURITY CONTROL
</b>
     Two guards watch Archer and Dubov disappear off the
     clinic's monitor.  They grab their shock-sticks and rush
     for the door.

     The door opens -- revealing Dubov and Archer.  Perfectly
     in synch -- they double cold-cock the startled guards.
     Archer grabs a shock-stick -- and fuses the door shut.

     He yanks out wires and shatters the computers.  Dubov
     mimics the behavior -- ripping out an entire console --
     and revealing a narrow cable duct.

     Flames explode -- shorting the circuitry -- the DRONING
     HUM RISES -- the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous
     surge.


<b>     AROUND PRISON
</b>
     Chaos.  Guards scatter as the huge diamond-vision SCREEN
     EXPLODES and inmates are flung like rag-dolls by their
     short-circuiting boots.  Anything metallic flies into the
     magnetic domes.


<b>     SECURITY CENTRAL
</b>
     As the men back through the cable duct -- Archer
     struggles to replace the heavy console.

     The DOOR is BLOWN open.  Walton enters to find... no one.
     Then his eyes light on the console -- slightly askew.


<b>     INT. CABLE CORRIDOR
</b>
     Archer and Dubov rush down the tight corridor -- and
     around the bend.  The corridor ends in a...


<b>     STORAGE/MAINTENANCE AREA
</b>
     Lined with tools, toilets, sinks, a rack of old lock-down
     boots.  They race through the far door...


<b>     INT. CENTRAL TOWER ROOM
</b>
     Archer and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level
     labyrinth.  A hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with
     catwalks, staircases and high walls.

     ECHOES resound -- SHOUTING, FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER --
     they seem to be coming from all around them.

     Over the magnetic HUM -- Archer notices loose screws and
     other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall.  He pulls one
     screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized
     wall.

     Archer gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came.  

<b>                                                SMASH CUT:
</b>

<b>     SHEER WALL
</b>
     Archer and Dubov scale the face -- using the old metal
     boots.  They climb higher and higher as...

     Guards criss-cross the catwalks and staircases below and
     around them -- oblivious.

     Archer and Dubov almost reach the next level when...

<b>                             WALTON
</b>               There!

     BULLETS SMACK the wall around them -- just as Archer and
     Dubov reach the next catwalk.

     Archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far
     end.  But four guards descend on them -- and block their
     way.

     Fist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking
     guards.  Archer heaves one down the stairs -- into more
     guards.  Dubov drops another over the catwalk.

     They continue their desperate race for the door --
     reaching the landing.  As BULLETS PING around them --
     hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel.  He uses it as a
     shield as Archer sparks up Walton's lighter.

     As SLUGS EXPLODE into the shield -- Archer places the
     flame to his thumb... and peels off the skin mold.

     He presses his thumb to the door's keypad.  To his 
     horror, its LED reads "print unreadable."

     Walton and guards movie in, FIRING at closer and closer
     range.

     Dubov staggers under the FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.  The
     shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly
     disintegrating.

     Archer licks his thumb, tries again.  Finally it reads
     "Clearance Confirmed"... the door slides open.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Let's go!

     Dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards -- but
     as he turns to follow... Walton BLOWS him away.

     Archer reaches to pull Dubov through, but the riddled
     inmate ignores the helping hand.  Pulling the door shut,
     he collapses in front of it -- blocking it momentarily.


<b>     INT. HIGH CATWALK TOWER
</b>
     Archer hesitates for a moment... but that's all he has.
     he keeps going... up the winding staircase-catwalk --
     higher and higher -- a step ahead of the onrushing
     guards.

     As BULLETS CLANG around him -- Archer reaches the top.
     He ignores a sign which reads...

<b>                        EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY
</b><b>                       SAFETY LINES REQUIRED
</b>
     He charges straight up a ladder and plows right
     through --

</b>
<b>     EXT. PRISON - DAWN
</b>
     Archer's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world.

     A sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the
     bird...

     PULL WAY, WAY BACK to reveal:

     The prison's in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what
     appears to be just an abandoned, rusty oil rig platform.  

     Archer rushes over to a transport chopper.


<b>     INSIDE COCKPIT
</b>
     Archer searches for the keys.  No go.  He throws
     switches.  Nothing works.

     Guards pour out of the hatch -- FIRING.  Archer leaps
     from the chopper and jumps over the side to the
     platform's --


<b>     LOWER LEVEL
</b>
     He lands hard on the slanted, corrugated shed roof and
     rolls to the ground.  He grabs a high-pressure hose --
     and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards
     close in.

     Archer BLASTS the guards with the WATER CANNON --
     knocking Walton and others into the sea.  Archer upends a
     stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards.
     Archer spots:


<b>     TUGBOAT
</b>
     pulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea.

     Archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail --
     where the end of a crane's hook is tagged back.  Under
     FIRE -- Archer frees the hook, which swings away from the
     platform.

     Hanging on to the hook, it swings him out over the ocean.
     At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into...


<b>     CHOPPY SEA
</b>
     He pulls himself into the ZODIAC and frees it from the
     tug.  It ROARS off.


<b>     EXT. ZODIAC - MOVING - DAY
</b>
     The nylon craft zips through the waves -- approaching San
     Pedro Harbor.  The ENGINE SPUTTERS... low on gas.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Come on... come on...

     Archer senses something... He looks up and...

     Whoosh!  Something swoops down -- but it's just a
     pelican.

     He FIDDLES with the ENGINE -- which finally DIES.  Archer
     grabs the oars -- about to start rowing when --

     Another swoop!  This time it's the prison chopper.

     Archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor.  An
     idea.


<b>     WIDE SHOT
</b>
     The chopper settles over the Zodiac.

     Wind and water swirl around Archer...


<b>     CHOPPER
</b>
     Walton, drenched but obviously rescued, has archer in his
     sights... He starts to FIRE his MACHINE GUNS...


<b>     ZODIAC
</b>
     BULLETS RAIN down on the boat -- destroying it -- as
     Archer dives into the rolling swells...


<b>     INSIDE CHOPPER
</b>
     Walton RAKES the debris -- shredding it.

     The chopper does a final circle of the wreckage... then
     moves off... its ROTOR WASH THRASHING the buoy.


<b>     UNDER BUOY
</b>
     Archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy -- sucking
     air.


<b>     INT. ARCHER HOME - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Eve's asleep.  Castor, dressed, looks down at her like 
     Cortez at Montezuma -- triumphant, with overwhelming 
     power.


<b>     EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
</b>
     Heading for the car, Castor is about to light up when --

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Last night, I thought -- this
               isn't my husband.

     He pockets the smoke.  Eve is there, dressed somberly.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Then I woke up in the middle of
               the night -- and found you passed
               out in the study.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I couldn't sleep -- you roll
               around a lot.
                      (jingles car keys)
               Anyway, I'm late.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jon, you know what day it is.  I
               know it's difficult for you, but
               we still have to go.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Can't we skip it just this once?
               I gotta 'protect and serve', you
               know.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               'Protect and serve' later.  You're
               going.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Okay, if you insist.  But -- you
               drive.

     He climbs into the front seat beside her.


<b>     INT./EXT. CAR - MOVING - DAY
</b>
     A pastoral, hilly area near the coast.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               So who's this Karl creep Jamie's
               been seeing?  He's a little old
               for her, isn't he?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I don't know... they're about the

               Remember the all-night dentist?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Sure, how could I forget.
                      (changes subject)
               By the way, you never said
               anything about last night...

     He moves closer, stroking her hair as his BEEPER sounds.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Aren't you going to get that?

     He turns his beeper off, then touches her lips with his
     finger.  Without knowing exactly why, Eve tenses up.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jon -- this is hardly the time or
               place.

     Castor looks around in surprise because he sees she's 
     driving into --


<b>     SPRAWLING MEMORIAL PARK
</b>
     They drive through the gates -- passing a church marked
     "ST. MARY'S-BY-THE-SEA."  Nearby, the OCEAN ROARS.


<b>     EXT. ST. MARY'S CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
     It's beautiful here, striking and sad.  Now on foot,
     Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of 
     graves -- with no idea where she's leading him.

     Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone.  Castor
     joins her and reads the etched marble stone:

                       Matthew Archer, Age 5
                       Beloved Son & Brother
                       We Cherish You Always

     Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Happy birthday, Matty.

     She places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark...
     a little bulldozer... a spaceship.  Overwhelmed with 
     grief, she collapses into Castor.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               He took our baby, Jon.  He took
               our little boy.


<b>     FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S FACE
</b>
     He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy 
     whose mother is weeping into his chest.

     The ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly 
     returns Eve's embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the 
     victim's pain.

<b>                             CASTOR

<b>                             BUZZ
</b>               L.A.P.D.?  Even if he is alive,
               Castor isn't stupid enough to come
               back to the city.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               He's alive -- and he's already
               here.  Move!


<b>     EXT. PIER - NIGHT
</b>
     Something bobs up in the surf.  Archer is thrashed ashore
     by the breakers... he crawls gasping onto the sand.  He
     takes a few breaths -- then staggers up onto the beach.


<b>     EXT. TITO'S STREET - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer's heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon
     taped across Tito's front door.  Some teenage cholos
     notice him -- so Archer keeps right on going.


<b>     INT. TITO'S DUPLEX - NIGHT
</b>
     A rear window is forced open -- Archer pulls himself in.
     In the dim light, he sees the bullet hole on the wall...
     then the blood stains within the forensics chalk marks.

     He buckles and has to sit down.  Taking a deep breath, he
     picks up the phone and dials.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Dr. Archer please.   It's an
               emergency.
                      (listens)
               -- Her husband.

     Archer waits.  He pinches his throat -- trying to 
     dislodge the vocal implant.  His voice scrambles into 
     garbled static.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Hello, Eve -- I know this sounds
               crazy, but --
                      (reverting back)
               Dammit.


<b>     INT. HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT
</b>
     EVE deftly stitches up a gash above little IRIS's (8)
     eye.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               How did this happen, sweetie?

<b>                             IRIS'S DAD
</b>               She fell off her Big-Wheel.

     Something about his too-quick response rankles Eve.  She
     eyes the yuppy Dad with suspicion -- then notes some
     bruises on the child's arm.  A NURSE enters.

<b>                             NURSE
</b>               Dr. Archer -- your husband's on
               three.

</b>               Get Child Services down here --
               and don't let her father leave.
                      (goes to wall-phone)
               Jon?  Hello?

     INTERCUT Archer and Eve as necessary.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Eve, listen carefully.  The man
               you think is your husband --
               isn't.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Who is this?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Please, just listen!  Take Jamie
               and go to your mother's in Santa
               Fe.  Don't tell him where you're
               going -- just go.

</b>               Whoever you are -- don't call
               again...

     CLICK.  Archer sags in futility.  A SIREN snaps him back
     to reality.

     Archer goes to the window and carefully peers out.

     A squad CAR ROARS INTO VIEW -- then continues on its way.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I need to speak to Director
               Lazarro immediately... I have
               information about Castor Troy.

     Waiting... Archer rifles the room... finding car keys...
     a baggy jacket... Then...

<b>     INTERCUT WITH:
</b>

<b>     INT. FBI OFFICE
</b>
<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               This is Jon Archer.  Who's
               calling?

     Archer pauses... hearing his own voice speaking to him.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Well, if you're Jon Archer... I
               guess this must be Castor Troy...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I've gotta hand it to you, Jon.
               You're doing a damn respectable
               job of being me.  But let's face
               it, we both liked it better the
               way it was.  So before the cops
               blow your brains out -- why not
               tell me where you are...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               If you were really me, you'd
               know -- no discussion, no deals.

     Archer hangs up == leaving Castor stewing.


<b>     EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
     The automatic door lifts -- revealing Tito's old Buick.
     The big V-8 RUMBLES as Archer pulls out.  He doesn't get
     far as... menacing CHOLOS block his way.

<b>                             CHOLO # 1
</b>               Where are you going?

<b>                             CHOLO #2
</b>               Ten bucks he's the guy who popped
               Tito!

     The Cholos surround the Buick.  Archer's cornered like an
     animal as the angry teens pound on the windows.

     Archer HITS the GAS -- scattering all except Cholo #1 who
     jumps on the hood.  Archer SLAMS the BRAKES -- sending
     the guy flying.  He lands hard, but is only shaken up.

     As Archer roars off, Cholo #1 pulls out his cell phone.

<b>                             CHOLO #1
</b>               9-1-1?  I want to report a stolen
               car and don't put me on hold!


<b>     INT./EXT. BUICK - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer drives on -- listening to KFWB.

<b>                             RADIO REPORTER (V.O.)
</b>               ... the escapee is considered
               extremely dangerous.  If you have
               any information concerning the
               whereabouts of Castor Troy...

     He SHUTS it OFF as he sees in the distance:


<b>     HIS OWN HOME
</b>
     FBI and LAPD vehicles are parked in front.  No way he's
     getting near there.

     In his rearview mirror Archer spots a cop car
     approaching.  He quickly turns a corner as the cop slowly
     cruises by.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               No, Jon... you have to think like
               Castor.  Where would he go...?

     Archer gets an idea.  But as he drives on -- the cop car
     backs up -- and reappears INTO FRAME.

<b>     
</b><b>     EXT. MELROSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
</b>
     Dietrich locks up his chic art gallery.  He gets in his 
     Lexus and drives out of the parking lot.


<b>     INT./EXT. STREET - LEXUS - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
     Dietrich slows down to check out the forensics team
     swarming all over Tito's parked Buick.  Dietrich quickly
     averts his face as he spots... "Jon Archer" inspecting
     Tito's Buick.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               Jon Archer... some poor schmuck's
               in big trouble.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Yeah -- me.

     With surprising speed, Dietrich yanks a pistol from
     someplace and jerks around --

     Archer -- hunkered down in the back seat -- stares into 
     the barrel of Dietrich's pistol.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               Jesus Christ, Castor.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Drive.  And punch up your
               cellular -- I need you to make
               some calls.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               You're gonna get me busted!

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You're already busted, Dietrich.
               It's just a matter of time before
               they pick you up.

     Dietrich snakes the car past the crime scene and speeds
     off.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               Man, when you came to me about
               that bomb -- I knew I should have
               blown you off... but that's my
               fucking curse -- I just can't say
               no to a friend.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You can't say no to money.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               That's my other curse.


<b>     EXT. DOWNTOWN - LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
     Cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low-
     rent streets.

     Emerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo,
     Fitch and their sexy girl friends, LIVIA and Cindee.


<b>     INT. DIETRICH'S LOFT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer splashes water on his face -- then stops and
     listens as the DOORBELL RINGS.  He screws up his courage.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You're Castor Troy... This is your
               old crew -- you don't take shit
               and you don't take no for an
               answer...


<b>     INT. DIETRICH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
     The thugs admire the loft -- dominated by an enormous,
     in-progress mural and stunning glass-bricked floor.

<b>                             ALDO
</b>               Helluva place, Dietrich.  So
               what's the big surprise?

     Archer emerges.  The men are stunned -- the women beam.

<b>                             FITCH
</b>               Are you crazy?  You're going to
               bring the Feds down on all of us!

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Archer doesn't want you, he wants
               me!  But I'm going to get him
               first -- with your help.

<b>                             ALDO
</b>               Archer's a damn celebrity now --
               he's untouchable -- and you're
               radioactive.

     He turns to leave.  Archer wheels him around and smashes
     him into the wall.  Aldo goes for his gun, but Archer's
     too quick -- he strips him of it.

     The four bodyguards draw their weapons -- and surround
     Archer.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You wanna face-off with Castor
               Troy?  Come on, then!  Come on!
               'Cause I've had a real bad day...

     Four against one -- and everyone's sweating but Archer.
     One-by-one, the bodyguards back off.  Archer points the
     gun at Aldo -- then smiles and hands it back.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You're all forgetting who the real
               enemy is.
                      (to Aldo)
               Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled
               you in for questioning.  He
               rattled you so bad -- you shit
               your Armani suit right there in
               the interrogation room.

     Aldo blanches -- how did Castor know that?  Fitch laughs.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer
               laughed at your last arraignment,
               when you got down on your knees
               and tried to blow your way to
               freedom.

     Stunned, Fitch cringes as everybody cracks up.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               We all have a reason to hate Jon
               Archer.  We all want to see him
               dead --

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               And nobody's untouchable if we say
               he's not.

     The thugs exchange a glance... reading each other...
     considering.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               It's all worked out.  Caz has
               Archer's routine down cold.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               We start with your basic
               kidnapping.  Then -- a little
               surgery.

<b>                             FITCH
</b>               Surgery?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I'm going to rearrange his face in
               a way you won't believe.

<b>                             ALDO
</b>               You're an evil bitch, Caz.  But
               you've got balls of titanium.
               Count us in.

     Archer sighs with relief -- pleased with his performance.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               Come on -- let's drink to it!


<b>     FULL SCREEN - BLUE CAPSULE
</b>
     Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high-
     ball glass filled with mescal.  he hands it to Archer.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               How about one of your famous
               toasts, Caz?

     They all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh --
               blow jobs?

     Silence -- then they crack up.  Reluctantly, Archer
     swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge
     to puke.

<b>                             LIVIA
</b>               Enough business, Caz.  Let's
               dance.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Sorry... I don't...

     She drags him onto the glass floor.  Cindee puts on some
     MUSIC as Archer's head begins to spin.  The girls start
     "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies.  He
     tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist.

<b>                             LIVIA
</b>               Remember the Charger's game, Caz?
               The owners box?  We did it four
               times.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Sure I remember... Once a quarter,
               right?

     Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings.

     The twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he
     starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he
     struggles to regain control of his battered psyche.

<b>                             LIVIA
</b>               Caz?  Are you okay?

     He pulls away and stumbles down the stairs -- toward the
     kitchen.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               When even Castor Troy can't handle
               a tab of Quantrex...
                      (raises his glass)
               That, dear friends, is the first
               sorry whiff of old age.


<b>     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer has his mouth under the tap -- drinking greedily.
     Woozy, he takes a breath... and notices a reflection in
     the window above the sink.  Archer turns to see -- Sasha.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               -- Sasha Hassler.  Age 35.  Met
               Castor Troy in Austin, Texas, at
               Pearl Jam reunion...
                      (catches himself)
               Uh, how you doing, baby?

     She responds by slapping him -- hard.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               What the hell are you doing here?
               You're supposed to be dead...

     He wobbles, then falls flat on his face.  Out cold.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - BALCONY - NIGHT
</b>
     Castor's chain-smoking, looking out over the city --
     wondering where Archer might be hiding.  But something
     breaks his rumination.  He sees --


<b>     DOWN STREET
</b>
     A BMW pulls up to the curb.  The THUMPING MUSIC from
     within GOES QUIET, but no one emerges.


<b>     EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
</b>
     Curious, Castor approaches the car, keeping a safe 
     distance.  He can see Jamie inside, struggling with Karl.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               No... Karl, please.

     He "shushes" Jamie -- but doesn't stop pawing her.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               My father -- he's got a gun --

<b>                             KARL
</b>                      (pulls open belt)
               That wimp won't do shit.

     SMASH!  The passenger WINDOW EXPLODES inward.  Castor
     drags Karl out by his hair.  Jamie scrambles out and
     flees toward the house as...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Who are you to call Jon Archer a
               wimp?

     Castor heaves Karl into the WINDSHIELD -- SPIDER-WEBBING 
     it.  Somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind 
     the wheel.  The Beemer lurches away.


<b>     INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Castor enters to find Jamie, still shaken up.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What are you -- stupid?

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               That's just like you.  Some guy
               tries to rape me -- and you side
               with him.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Did it look like I was siding with
               him?  Did it?
                      (she falls silent)
               You want to play with scummy organ
               grinders, you better be prepared.
               Do you have protection?

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               You mean like... condoms?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I mean like... protection.

     With a fluid motion, Castor expertly SNAPS open a well-
     oiled SWITCHBLADE and hands it to an astonished Jamie.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               For me?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Next time -- slip it in low, then
               twist it -- so the wound doesn't
               close.

     She hugs him tight -- taking Castor by surprise.  But he
     responds momentarily.  About to pat her rump -- something
     makes him stop.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Go on, get out of here.

     Jamie kisses him and heads up stairs.  After she's
     gone...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               No wonder he spent all his time
               chasing me.  Who can deal with
               this family shit?

     The PHONE RINGS.  He rushes to the den and picks it up.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Jon Archer.
                      (immediately alert)
               Where is he?


<b>     EXT. LOFT - ACROSS STREET - NIGHT
</b>
     Using night-vision goggles, Pollux watches Sasha close
     her drapes.  Visible in the b.g. on the sofa -- is
     Archer.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>                      (into cell phone)
               -- I thought he might visit some
               old friends of yours.  And bro, if
               I didn't know better -- I'd swear
               this guy likes being you...


<b>     INT. SASHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer wakens.  Sasha is tugging off his pants.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Uh -- can't we just talk?

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Talk?  The only talk I ever heard
               from you was 'take it off,' 'sit
               on it,' 'I'll pay you tomorrow.'

     She pulls out some fresh clothes -- and dumps them on
     him.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Take off the rest of those rags
               and get dressed.  Then get out.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Not until I finish my business
               with your brother.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               I told him to keep those creeps
               away -- but you're just too big an
               attraction.
                      (calming herself)
               Look, if the F.B.I. finds out
               you've been here -- I'll lose my
               son.  So please, just go.

     For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon --
     but a frightened, protective mother.  And he realizes the
     effect his own relentless obsession has had on her.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I know I've done some things that
               made your life harder...

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               How would you?  You walked out and
               never looked back.

     ADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling
     Sasha's deep-seated anger.  Archer finishes dressing.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I'm not the same person you
               remember.  And for what it's
               worth, I'm sorry...

     Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a
     woman trying to hate someone she still loves.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Not a bad fit.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               They should.  They're yours.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Nice-looking kid, too

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Of course he is...

     Sasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil.
     Then...

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Adam, come here... I want you to
               meet your father.

     Archer's face pales over in shock.


<b>     EXT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Their silhouettes are visible against the shades.

<b>     PULL BACK...
</b>

<b>     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
     Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>                      (into cellular)
               We've got him sighted.  Okay,
               Pollux, pull out.

<b>                             BUZZ
</b>               What makes you so sure this guy's
               gonna set up his own brother?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I've never been more certain of
               anything.  Get everyone in
               position.  Remember -- shoot to
               kill.

     Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue."

<b>                             BUZZ
</b>               You heard the man -- let's saddle
               up!


<b>     INT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Playing with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy
     gaze.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               How old is he?

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Five.  No one knows you're his
               father.  I thought someone might
               want to hurt him -- just to hurt
               you...

<b>                             ADAM
</b>               Bang!  Bang!  Bang!

     Startled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at
     them.  Upset, she takes it from his hands.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               You know Mommy doesn't like you
               playing with these things...

     She kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to
     Archer.  Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy.

     Archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his
     big hands dwarfing the little boy's body.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               You're not holding him right...
               Caz...

     Archer isn't hearing Sasha.  He's lost in his own
     memory... the sound of a CAROUSEL... a KID'S LAUGHTER...
     a GUNSHOT...

     Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled.
     It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something 
     strong.  He regains control, dumping the child into 
     Sasha's arms.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               He's not my son.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Yes, he is -- !

     Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting 
     shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest 
     second.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Get down!

     K-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!  The WINDOW PANES SHATTER -- as 
     TEARGAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the loft.


<b>     OUTSIDE
</b>
     across the way, Castor directs the FIREPOWER.


<b>     INT. UPPER LEVEL
</b>
     Chaos.  A bodyguard is mowed down.  Dietrich and the
     others scatter and hit the floor.


<b>     KITCHEN
</b>
     Cindee and Fitch are caught in flagrante delicto on the
     floor as the kitchen is decimated by GUNFIRE...


<b>     SASHA'S BEDROOM
</b>
     Coughing, Archer crawls through the roiling smoke toward 
     the door.  He's almost out when...

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Adam!

     Her wail of fear freezes Archer.  He looks back -- and
     sees Adam in the eye of the firestorm.

     Archer's face betrays his conflict.  A child -- but his
     worst enemy's child.

     BULLETS SHRED the WALL around Adam.  Getting closer.

     Archer moves -- he crawls toward Adam.

     Just then -- a SWAT agent rappels in through one of the
     shattered windows, his weapon poised.  Archer kicks him
     hard, pitching him back through the window.

     Archer grabs Adam -- curling him into his body.  Thinking
     fast, he soaks his discarded T-shirt into a toppled
     flower vase -- then places it over Adam's face.
     Protecting him.

     He rushes to Sasha.  Together, they barrel through the
     soft, paper wall and tear out an escape route.


<b>     INT. KITCHEN
</b>
     FIRING out the window, Fitch is riddled from outside by
     an agent as he CRASHES through the WINDOW.

     Cindee slashes the agent with a cleaver.  He FIRES --
     BLASTING Cindee into the refrigerator.


<b>     LOWER LEVEL
</b>
     Archer hustles Sasha and Adam toward the staircase
     when --


<b>     FRONT DOOR
</b>
     explodes open.  SWAT agents swarm to get in -- FIRING and
     throwing FLASH-GRENADES.


<b>     ARCHER, SASHA AND ADAM
</b>
     are caught out in the open, when --


<b>     UPPER LEVEL
</b>
     Dietrich, et al, open FIRE down on the attacking agents.
     Agents drop or are driven back out.


<b>     SKYLIGHT
</b>
     BURSTS open and agents rappel down -- FIRING.  Aldo's
     bodyguard falls, riddled, off the upper level.


<b>     LOWER LEVEL
</b>
     as one agent lands, Archer knocks his gun to the floor.
     They grapple.  As the agent reaches for it -- Adam
     appears and kicks the gun away.  Just like Mommy.


<b>     SASHA
</b>
     scoops up the kicked weapon -- and cold-cocks another
     rappelling agent.  Then she FIRES, cutting a third
     rappelling agent's rope.  he drops hard to the floor --
     unconscious.

     Still grappling, Archer rips off the agent's gas-mask...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Buzz...

     Buzz's eyes reveal only hatred.  He reaches for his
     knife.  Archer hesitates, then heaves Buzz through the 
     glass door.  He pushes Adam upstairs as more agents pour
     in the front door.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Dietrich!  The painting!


<b>     UPPER LEVEL
</b>
     Dietrich sees the canvas mural above the breached front
     door -- and understands.  He opens FIRE, cutting loose
     the mural.  It collapses, billowing -- and enshrouds the
     attacking agents -- and buying time.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               Let's go!

     Archer and Sasha flee up the stairs.


<b>     UPPER LEVEL
</b>
     Sasha sees Adam huddled in the middle of the glass floor
     -- the shadows of agents moving below.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Adam!


<b>     LOWER LEVEL
</b>
     An agent aims his shotgun at the glass floor -- at the
     "target" kneeling on top of it.


<b>     UPPER LEVEL
</b>
     Archer dives and grabs the boy as the GLASS FLOOR
     EXPLODES up.  He rolls through a shower of glass -- but
     comes up with Adam safely.

     Agents and thugs FIRE blindly upward and downward through
     the floor -- desperate to hit their targets.

     Agents open FIRE from the girders supporting the roof --
     cutting down Fitch's last bodyguard.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               They're like cockroaches!

     Dietrich and Livia toss SMOKE GRENADES into the loft --
     covering their escape.


<b>     TOP LEVEL
</b>
     Dietrich leads them to the very back of the loft.  He
     pulls open a hidden door.

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               If we make it, we'll meet up at my
               Malibu place.  You remember it,
               Caz?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Off Kanan Road -- I know it.

     Archer hands Adam over to Sasha.  She hugs her little boy
     -- then embraces Archer tightly.  Hanging on -- near
     tears -- because she knows this may be the last time.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Thank you, Caz... thank you...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Get the boy out of here...

     Livia and the remaining bodyguard hustle Archer out --


<b>     INT. ROTUNDA - NIGHT
</b>
     MAC-10 poised, Livia and the bodyguard rush Archer
     through the deserted rotunda -- BOOM!  BOOM!  His escorts
     drop.

     Castor rushes down the staircase -- BLASTING at Archer.
     Unarmed, Archer instantly disappears behind one of the
     eight columns.  The columns are separated by mirrored-
     panels.

     Cat-and-mouse as Castor slips in and out between column
     and mirror.  He spots Archer dead-ahead and BLASTS away!

     CRASH!  The MIRROR SHATTERS into a thousand pieces.

<b>                             ARCHER (O.S.)
</b>               That's about a thousand years bad
               luck...

     Castor whirls, spots Archer again and FIRES!  Another
     MIRROR.  Sensing Archer behind him -- Castor turns and
     FIRES again -- this time BLASTING away his OWN
<b>     REFLECTION.
</b>
     Then Archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame -- and
     onto Castor.  They battle for control of the pistol.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               It's too late, Jon.  Your kid
               loves me.  And your wife's an
               animal.  Even I can't keep up with
               her.

     They're so close Castor's whispering right in Archer's
     ear.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Tonight I'm going to make her come
               like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate
               your death.

     Castor licks Archer's ear salaciously.  Enraged, Archer
     tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on Castor.

     He's got Castor dead to rights -- suddenly BULLETS SHRED
     the world around him.  Archer staggers away as --

     Loomis enters -- FIRING his M-16 as Archer dives for a
     doorway.  Loomis FIRES the M-16's grenade launcher.

     BOOM!  The GRENADE EXPLODES -- the doorway bursts into
     flames -- but Archer has made it through.

     Loomis tries to help up Castor -- who pushes him off
     angrily.  Castor can't follow through the flames.


<b>     EXT. ROOF - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer slams out of the interior stairwell -- but BULLETS
     force him to take cover behind the cupola.

     Pollux FIRES at him from the other side.

     Archer RETURNS FIRE -- driving Pollux back.  Stand-off.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Remember me?  Your 'baby brother'?

     Trying to get the drop, Pollux carefully crawls onto the
     top of the cupola.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               You tricked me into telling you
               things I never told anyone...

     Archer hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the
     crown.

<b>                             POLLUX
</b>               Now take it to your grave.

     Archer FIRES his PISTOL -- into the glass cupola -- and
     SHATTERS the GLASS beneath Pollux's feet.  The cupola
     disintegrates beneath his weight.  He plunges down
     into --


<b>     ROTUNDA
</b>
     Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the
     floor at his feet.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Pollux...

     Pollux is almost gone.  Castor looks up and sees --


<b>     ARCHER
</b>
     Peering down into the rotunda.


<b>     CASTOR
</b>
<b>     OPENS FIRE --
</b>

<b>     ARCHER
</b>
     Ducks the bullets as he disappears.

     Castor desperately holds Pollux -- to no avail.  Pollux
     slips away... and dies.  He turns to Loomis...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Get a medic -- now!

<b>                             LOOMIS
</b>               Forget him, sir.  It's only Pollux
               Troy...

     Castor snaps.  Without hesitation, he jerks up his GUN
     and PUTS a BULLET right in the middle of Loomis's
     forehead.

     Castor looks at the dead kid -- his rage barely abated
     as -- Buzz and Wanda arrive on the scene and see Loomis's 
     body.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               What happened?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What the fuck do you think
               happened?  Castor Troy just
               shot him!
                      (beat)
               What are you waiting for?  Go!

     After Buzz and Wanda take off -- Castor gathers Pollux up 
     in his arms -- totally devastated.


<b>     INT. F.B.I - DAY
</b>
     Dazed, Castor approaches his office.  Kim proudly holds a
     copy of Time magazine.  His photo is on the cover.

<b>                             KIM
</b>               Sir -- you're on the cover of
               Time.  They're calling you 'An
               Authentic American Hero.'

     He just pushes by her and goes into his office.


<b>     INT. FBI - ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Alone -- Castor picks up the framed photo of Eve and
     Jamie -- staring at it with unbridled hatred.

     Fury rising, he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in
     his clenching grip.  He hurls it into other Archer family
     memorabilia -- shattering more photos and souvenirs.

     Only then does Castor notice Lazarro standing in the
     doorway.  For how long -- he can't be sure.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What is it?

     Lazarro shuts the door behind him.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               We were friends once, Jon, so I
               feel I owe it to you -- to tell
               you face-to-face...
                      (a beat)
               I don't care how much hype you're
               getting -- you're through.  After
               that massacre last night, I'm
               ordering a full inquiry into your
               recent erratic -- and deeply
               suspect -- behavior.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Me -- 'erratic'?  Victor, what are
               you talking about?

     Castor casually closes the blinds between the offices.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               You start meeting with Brodie and
               Miller.  Then they die
               mysteriously.  Your best friend is
               murdered -- and you don't seem to
               give a shit.
               Suddenly you're smoking, drinking,
               acting like a man with something
               to hide...
                      (beat)
               Maybe you've been bought -- maybe
               you've lost your mind.  But I
               promise... I'm going to find out.

     Eye to eye... Castor knows he can't finesse this one.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Okay, Vic, I have a confession to
               make.  But you aren't gonna like
               it...
                      (wraps arm
                       around neck)
               I'm Castor Troy.

<b>                             LAZARRO
</b>               -- I don't understand...

     Castor suddenly jabs his fist into Lazarro's chest.  He
     pleads for mercy as Castor pounds and pounds away at his
     heart -- until it finally seizes up.

     Lazarro twitches in a death throe, then slumps to the
     ground.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Now you understand.

     He punches up the intercom button.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Cancel my four o'clock.
                      (beat)
               And send for the paramedics.
               Victor Lazarro's having a heart
               attack.

     Castor fixes himself a shot of mescal.  He checks his
     watch -- as if counting -- then kneels beside Lazarro's
     body.

     The door flies open -- and two medics rush in.  They see
     Castor vigorously pumping Lazarro's chest -- "applying"
<b>     CPR.
</b>
     The medics gently nudge Castor aside.  One medic takes
     Lazarro's pulse, then shakes his head.


<b>     EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - DAY
</b>
     Castor peers down over the city... trying to collect
     himself.  He lights up a smoke... planning his next move.
     His meditation is broken as a police chopper circles
     above.

<b>                                                MATCH CUT TO:
</b>

<b>     EXT. CITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</b>
     LAPD choppers circle... squad cars prowl... cops and FBI
     agents set up roadblocks.  The city is being sealed off.


<b>     EXT. DOWNTOWN - BROADWAY - DAY
</b>
     Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming
     undone... wobbly, wild-eyed... he suddenly picks up a
     trash can and carries it down the street in front of his
     face.

     Pedestrians gawk at this madman.  What's he doing?

     Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store.
     He swings the trash can.  SMASH!  The store's WINDOW
     SHATTERS.  An ALARM BLARES.

     Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned.  Then
     several youths leap into the window and start pulling
     merchandise out of the store.

     Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle.

     An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb.  A cop leaps
     out and chases as the looters scatter.

     The driver stands at his door, radio in hand.  Sensing
     something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister
     of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt.

     Archer sprays him in the face.  The cop gags and sags.
     Archer quickly slips behind the wheel.

     Inside:  Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows 
     darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside.  He
     HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away.


<b>     EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
     Archer slows the squad car.

     Up ahead:  Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main 
     road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic.

     Archer pulls off the road, out of sight.  He flips open 
     the portacomp and starts to type rapidly.


<b>     INT. FBI - DAY
</b>
     A DISPATCHER'S SCANNER CLICKS to life.

<b>                             DISPATCHER
</b>               All units.  I have a confirmed
               code zero-zero priority alert.
               Proceed at once to Parthenia
               Street Terminal.  That's Parthenia
               at Nordhoff.


<b>     QUICK SHOTS
</b>
<b>     A)  MOTOR POOL
</b>
         Tac squads pile into armored Jeeps.

<b>     B)  HELIPORT
</b>
         Choppers lift off and veer east.

<b>     C)  ARCHER'S HOUSE
</b>
         The surveillance CARS ROAR away.


<b>     EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY
</b>
     Archer watches as the checkpoint of cop cars pulls apart 
     and screams east on the main road -- passing Archer.  
     Once the armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west.


<b>     EXT. ARCHER HOME - BACK YARD - DAY
</b>
     A plank in the fence swings aside as Archer slips into
     the yard.  He peers out from behind the garage.

     A cop sits in a lawn chair, tuning a POLICE-BAND RADIO.

     Archer approaches the bird feeder.  Quietly, he sticks
     his hand inside -- and searches for the key.

     Just when he grabs it -- CAW-CAW -- an annoying BLUEBIRD
     hovers over Archer.  The cop looks over -- but Archer is
     gone.  All Lars sees is the bird.


<b>     INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY
</b>
     Castor arrives.  Wanda is shocked to see him.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               Commander, what are you doing

                      (looks around)
               Where's everyone else?

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               Backing you up!  Didn't you track

<b>                             CASTOR

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               You radioed in your personal
               security code.  Nobody knows that
               code but you.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Obviously someone else knows it!
               Get everybody back to their
               posts -- now!


<b>     INT. ARCHER HOME - SUNSET
</b>
     Archer tiptoes through the house -- listening.  He sees
     Cop #2 sitting at the dining room table, cleaning his
     pistol.  He slips upstairs -- toward the sound of
<b>     RUNNING WATER.
</b>

<b>     MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
     Archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing 
     the bed.  He stops.  On top of the rumpled covers:  Eve's
     nightgown and a pair of Castor's black briefs.

     Overwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has
     stopped.  Eve steps in from the bathroom.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Eve...

     The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality.
     She runs, but Archer grabs her.  She struggles -- 
     fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her 
     mouth covered.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I'm not going to hurt you.  Just
               don't scream, okay?
                      (no response)
               Okay?

     Terrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I know you -- you're the one who
               called.  You're Castor Troy.  You
               killed my son --

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               -- I called, but I'm not Castor.
               I'm your husband.

     Archer holds onto her as she struggles again.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Now, you're going to listen.  The
               last time we saw each other -- was
               in this room.  We had a fight
               after I told you I had to go away.
                      (a beat)
               My assignment -- Jon Archer's
               assignment -- was to enter a
               federal prison as Castor Troy.

     Eve is startled by this intimate information but she 
     reveals nothing.  SIRENS approach the house, the cops are 
     returning.  She keeps an eye on the door.  Playing for 
     time.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               How did he expect to do that?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               An F.B.I. surgeon gave me Castor's
               face.  He handled the transplant,
               the vocal implant, everything.
               But somehow Castor came out of his
               coma -- and killed everyone who
               knew about the mission.  But not
               before he was transformed into me.

     The back DOOR CLICKS open.  A voice booms out.

<b>                             COP (O.S.)
</b>               Dr. Archer, are you okay?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               If you need hard evidence, get it.
               Your husband's blood type is O
               negative.  Castor's is A.B.

     Archer glances at the balcony -- as FOOTSTEPS CLOMP up 
     the stairs.  Eve is about to answer -- or scream.  But 
     then...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Remember the parachute dream?  I'm
               falling, Eve... I'm falling...

     The blood drains from her face as... Archer slips over 
     the balcony and disappears.


<b>     INT. STUDY - LATER
</b>
     Eve is at the computer -- dazed and disoriented.  She
     snaps alert on hearing the front DOOR OPEN -- Castor is
     giving orders to the cops guarding the house.

<b>                             CASTOR (O.S.)
</b>               I want you guys here around-the-
               clock.  And stay off the lawn.

     Eve feigns interest in her laptop as Castor enters.  She
     tenses as he starts massaging her back.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               You're all in knots.  Maybe
               another date night will help you
               relax...

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Not tonight... I'm way behind in
               my Continuing Ed.

     He studies Eve, then grasps her firmly by the shoulders.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               You think I've been acting
               strange.  Like a completely
               different person.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               -- Yes.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Okay, I have a confession to make.
               But you aren't going to like it...

     Castor wraps his hands around her slender neck...

                             CASTOR (cont'd)
               ... I read your diary.  I've been
               trying to change -- trying to be
               more like the man you want me to
               be.

     Eve reacts to the explanation.  There is a logic to it.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               And to prove it, I'm taking you
               and Jamie away on a trip -- right
               after the memorial service.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               What memorial service?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Victor Lazarro had a heart
               seizure... right in my office.  It
               was horrible...

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Oh, my God...

     Castor pours it on -- feigning immense grief.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               First Tito... now Victor...
                      (holds her tight)
               ... please don't tell me I'm going
               to lose you, too...

<b>                             EVE
</b>                      (returns the embrace)
               Of course not.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Castor slumbers fitfully.  Suddenly, his shoulder
     twitches, rousing him.  He looks up to find Eve reading
     beside him.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               What was that?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               What was what?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Something bit me.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Probably a mosquito -- I'll close
               the window.

     Eve rubs Castor's shoulder blade until he falls asleep.  
     She gets up, closes the window, then goes into the
     bathroom.


<b>     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Eve takes a breath, then produces a lancet from her
     pocket.  She squeezes the lancet -- and a drop of blood
     splashes into a glass vial -- Castor's blood.


<b>     EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT
</b>
     As Eve gets the key in her car door -- a hand grabs her.
     She stifles a scream -- then sees... the two COPS.

<b>                             COP
</b>               Sorry, Dr. Archer.  Where are you
               going at this hour?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               There's been an emergency at the

<b>                             COP

<b>                             EVE

               But please don't wake my
               husband... he's exhausted.


<b>     EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</b>
     Nothing happening here at 4 A.M.  Nothing indeed.  The
     bored Cop keeps watch outside -- as Eve hustles in.


<b>     INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
     Eve paces anxiously as the BLOOD ANALYZER CLICKS away.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Please be O-neg.  Please...

     The MACHINE STOPS CLICKING.  It reads "Male -- Type AB."  
     She buries her face in her hands -- completely stunned.

<b>                             ARCHER (O.S.)
</b>               Thanks for believing me.

     Archer emerges from the darkness of her office -- but Eve
     pulls a pistol -- aiming it with calm authority.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               What are you doing?  Where did you

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I took it from my fake husband.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Why point it at me?  I'm the real

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's
               already dead.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               What more proof do you need?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Tell me... tell me about the all-
               night dentist.

     As Archer speaks -- Eve searches his eyes for the truth.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               ... I took a date out for chicken
               and ribs -- not knowing she was a
               vegetarian.  When the night
               couldn't get worse, she broke
               her tooth on a pebble that got
               into her three-bean salad
               Somehow she and I had fun driving
               around looking for an all-night
               dentist...
                      (a beat)
               And even though it must have hurt
               -- you still kissed me.

     Eve slowly puts the gun down, fighting off tears.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Christ, Jon!  How could you put us

</b>               Whatever happened, whatever he did
               -- I know it's my fault and I know
               I can never make it up to you --

     She pulls herself together -- regaining her composure.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               But you're damn well going to try.
                      (a beat)
               First -- how are we going to get
               you out of this?


<b>     INT. ARCHER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Castor wakes up and finds Eve gone.  His eyes narrow as
     he touches the mosquito bite -- the one that isn't there.


<b>     INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
     Eve sifts through the supply cabinet and finds a yellow
     vial.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               This will knock him out for hours.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Good.  What's his schedule
               tomorrow?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               He doesn't tell me anymore than
               you ever did... All I know is --
               tomorrow we're going to Victor's
               memorial service.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Victor... Tito... they both died
               thinking I killed them... And in a
               way... I did.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jon -- you can't think about that
               now.

     Archer takes a breath -- and pulls himself together.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               -- What happens after the memorial?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               He's taking Jamie and me away.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               And neither of you will be coming
               back.  Where's the service?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea.

     Archer reacts... the irony's not lost on him.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               What are you going to do?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Hit him with a trank dart.  Once
               he's unconscious -- I'll try to
               get to Buzz and Wanda before the
               security team gets to me.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               What else can I do?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Think up a good excuse.  I don't
               want you or Jamie anywhere near
               that service.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I can cover for Jamie.  But if I'm
               not there, he'll suspect
               something...
                      (as Archer
                       considers)
               The second you make your move, all
               hell's going to break loose.  If
               I'm there beside him -- I can take
               charge.  I'm his wife, remember?
                      (a beat)
               There's no way around it -- for
               once, you need me.

     Archer looks into her eyes -- the regrets flooding over.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I've always needed you...

     They embrace... soaking up each other's warmth.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jon -- what are the odds?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Terrible.  But it's the best we
               can do with what we have.
                      (a beat)
               If it doesn't happen, take Jamie
               and don't look back...

<b>                             EVE
</b>               It'll happen.

     FOOTSTEPS APPROACH -- they break their embrace.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Do doctors travel in packs?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Only when we're golfing.


<b>     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
     Castor and the twins round the bend -- just in time to
     see the door to the burn ward close.


<b>     INT. BURN WARD - NIGHT
</b>
     Eve quickly wraps gauze around a patient's head -- when
     Castor and his boys rush in, guns leveled.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jon!  What are you doing here?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               That's what you're going to
               explain to me.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Didn't the police tell you?  There
               was an emergency.

     Lars starts pulling at the patient's bandages.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jon -- stop it!  Mr. Alandro is
               very ill!

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Not as ill as he's going to be...

     He blanches as Lars reveals a scarred burn victim -- Mr.
     Alandro.  Eve is livid as she attends to the patient.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Sorry.  But what's a guy to think
               when his wife runs off in the
               middle of the night?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               It's my fault.  I should've woken
               you up before I left.
                      (kisses him)
               Now please let me get back to
               work.

     They leave.  Eve wipes his ugly taste from her mouth.


<b>     EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAWN
</b>
     Castor gets into his car as he confabs with the twins.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Stay here.  Watch her like a hawk.

<b>                             LARS
</b>               Think she knows?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Who cares?  She's going to be dead
               by tonight anyway.  They're all
               going to be dead.  The wife, the
               kid... and the father.


<b>     EXT. OLD RANCH - HIGH GRASS - DAY
</b>
     Archer waits as Sasha appears with a long case.  In the
     b.g., Adam plays on the Ranch House porch with Dietrich.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               How's the boy?

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               His ears are still ringing -- but
               he'll be okay.

     Archer opens the case.  Inside is a sniper rifle.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               The truck's all gassed up.
               Look, Caz, there'll be F.B.I.
               agents all over that place.  Maybe
               I can talk my brother into helping
               us.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               'Us'?  No, Sasha -- believe me,
               this isn't your fight.

     He turns to leave -- but her look draws him back.  He
     kisses her -- not passionately, but nobly.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Thanks...

     She watches him as he walks off toward the truck.


<b>     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - DAY
</b>
     Dressed in staid black, Eve joins Castor at the limo.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Where's Jamie?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               That's what I'd like to know.  She
               stole fifty dollars from my purse
               and took off.

     Castor's eyes narrow -- trying to read Eve.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Don't act so stunned, Jon.  You
               know how hard it is to get that
               girl into a dress.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I'll deal with her later.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Good.  Because I am fed up.


<b>     EXT. ST. MARY'S-BY-THE-SEA - DAY
</b>
     A crucifix gleams in the sun... and anchoring the
     crucifix is... a headstone.

     Like so many others -- except this headstone is Matthew
     Archer's.  And hidden behind it is -- Jon Archer.  He
     finishes assembling the sniper rifle.

     For a moment he acknowledges Matthew's grave... the
     regrets giving way to determination.  He looks down from
     his vantage point onto --


<b>     EXT. SEA-SIDE - DAY
</b>
     At the foot of the cemetery knoll.  Rows of chairs...
     white flowers... mourners.  A yacht is docked at the
     breakwater.

<b>     INTERCUT WITH:
</b>

<b>     ARCHER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE
</b>
     peers down through scope -- seeing...

     Castor and Eve as they emerge from their limo.

     Eve glances around, searching for Archer.  She comes eye-
     to-eye with Lars -- who is watching her every move.

     Archer TRACKS Castor and Eve as they sit in the front
     row.  The ceremony begins.

<b>                             PRIEST
</b>               We are here to celebrate the life
               of Victor Lazarro.  We all know
               him as a man who dedicated himself
               to defending this great nation --
               first, as a highly decorated
               admiral -- then, as west coast
               director of the F.B.I.  But not
               all of you know what a deeply
               spiritual man he was.  It was his
               wish that his Requiem Mass be
               performed in Latin.
                      (a beat)
               In Nomine Patris, et Filii et
               Spiritus Sancti.  Amen...

     The PRIEST begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass.


<b>     ARCHER
</b>
     fills the trank-dart with sedative.


<b>     PRIEST
</b>
     continues the solemn ritual.

<b>                             PRIEST
</b>               Domine, de morte aeterna, in
               die illa tremenda quando caeli
               movendi sunt et terra...


<b>     EVE
</b>
     checks her watch... barely lifting her eyes away...

     Castor absently pats her knee.  She's forced to return
     focus to the service.


<b>     ARCHER
</b>
     chambers the dart, twists a knob on the range-finder, and
     carefully peers over the crucifix.


<b>     THROUGH SCOPE
</b>
     Archer TRACKS THROUGH the mourners -- and FINDS Castor.
     As the cross-hairs neatly cube his head...


<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     We've come full circle from Matthew's death:  with Archer
     the sniper and Castor the target.

     The Priest's emotional reciting of the rites climaxes.

<b>                             PRIEST
</b>               Requiem aeternam dona eis,
               Domine... Amen.


<b>     FULL SCREEN - TRIGGER
</b>
     Archer's finger wraps around -- he starts to squeeze...


<b>     POV THROUGH SCOPE - FIGURE
</b>
     crosses behind Castor, blocking Archer's shot.  Archer's
     finger freezes -- as the figure turns -- hair tumbling
     away from her face.  It's Jamie.


<b>     AT SERVICE
</b>
     Eve stiffens as Jamie sits down.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               Thanks anyway, Mom --
                      (slides her $50)
               But I wanted to be here for you...
               and Dad.

     Castor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing.

     He simply takes Jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in
     hers.

     The honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles,
     commencing their 21-GUN SALUTE as --


<b>     ARCHER
</b>
     steadies himself, re-aims the sniper rifle.

     He hears MOTION behind him.  Someone's coming and fast...
     but this is his only chance.  Off-balance, Archer
     squeezes --

     THFFFT!  The SILENCED TRANK-DART explodes from the
     barrel.


<b>     FOLLOW DART
</b>
     Screaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide.
     It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during
     the 21-GUN SALUTE.


<b>     ON KNOLL
</b>
     THUMP!  Archer is cracked across the head.  He slumps
     down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters
     his ear.  As the saluting GUNS FIRE in the b.g. -- we
     don't know when, or if, this pistol fires...


<b>     AT SEA-SIDE SERVICE
</b>
     The honor guard presents the urn to Mrs. Lazarro.
     Fearful, Eve chances a glance around -- wondering what's
     gone wrong.

<b>                             PRIEST
</b>               The admiral's family will now take
               his ashes to the sea...

     As Mrs. Lazarro and her grown children proceed to the
     docked yacht, Castor touches his ear-phone...
     getting a message.

     His eyes alight on a boathouse... adjacent to the
     service.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>                      (into headset)
               Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car
               around, then meet us at that
               boathouse...

     Guests head for their cars.  Eve seizes the moment and
     steps over to Wanda and Buzz.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Wanda -- I need to talk to you.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>                      (reads her face)
               Sure... what's wrong?

     But then Eve looks past Wanda -- and sees Lars looking at
     her -- tightening his "friendly" grip on Jamie's
     shoulder.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Never mind --

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Come on, baby.  I've got a
               surprise for you.

     Wanda and Buzz watch as they head up toward the
     boathouse.


<b>     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Dim, deserted.  Filled with boat parts, tools, etc.
     Castor hustles Eve inside and locks the door behind him.

     Lunt is there -- standing over a beaten Archer.  Eve
     gasps.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Look who we caught creeping around
               -- Castor Troy.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Why is he here?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Before I turn him in, I thought
               we'd pay him back for everything
               he's put us through...

     Castor starts kicking Archer.  Over and over in the gut.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Come on, baby.  Join the fun --

     Eve can't stand it.  She charges Castor -- but he
     immediately subdues her.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Too bad.  Part of me was hoping
               you didn't know.

     He throws her down beside Archer.  She clings to him.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Did you really think it would be
               that easy, you dumb fucks?
                      (to Eve)
               Sorry, baby.  Castor Troy is about
               to murder you and our daughter...
               but I promise you won't die
               unavenged.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               This is between you and me.  Leave
               them out of this.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               It was between you and me.  Even
               your little boy -- that wasn't
               supposed to happen.  But you
               couldn't let it go.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               No father could.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Appealing to my sense of 'family'
               won't work, Jon.  I thought you
               knew me better than that

     Archer plays for time -- looking for some edge.  He sees
     a crate filled with block-and-tackle amid the shop's
     tools.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I know some things that even you
               don't know, Caz.  You have a son.
               I've met him.  His name is Adam...

<b>                             CASTOR

                      (cocks pistol)
               No more head games... First your
               wife dies.  Then your daughter.
               Then you.

     Castor smiles as the DOOR CREAKS open.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Just one big happy family...

     But it's not Jamie and Lars.  Three people emerge from
     the shadows, machine pistols poised.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Dietrich -- Aldo -- Sasha?

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               That's right, Archer.  Now drop
               'em.

     No options.  Castor and Lunt drop their weapons.


<b>     EXT. BOATHOUSE - SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY
</b>
     Lars and Jamie pull up in the car.  Lars listens to his
     headset -- knows something is wrong.

<b>                             LARS
</b>               Don't fucking move...


<b>     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Sasha's at Archer's side.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               Caz -- are you okay?

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               You're making a mistake.  I'm
               Castor -- he's Archer.  Sasha,
               baby -- just give me a minute to
               explain!

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               That's pathetic, Archer.  But
               then, your terrible sense of humor
               is legendary.

<b>                             ALDO
</b>                      (cocks GUN)
               It's pay-back time.

     Aldo aims at Castor when BOOM!  He's blown apart.

     Lars charges in -- BLASTING.

     Archer grabs a block-and-tackle as --

     Lunt dives for Aldo's fallen machine-pistol.  Archer
     swings the block-and-tackle -- whacking Lunt across the
     head.

     Castor scoops up his pistol but Eve kicks him hard in the
     balls.  He doubles over.

     Archer snatches away the MACHINE PISTOL.  Staggered --
     Lunt is quickly riddled by Dietrich.

     Castor and Lars BLAZE at the now-scattering intruders --
     driving them back amid the shot's tools and drums.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Find Jamie!

     Eve crawls through the FUSILLADE toward the exit.


<b>     EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY
</b>
     Among the last to leave -- Buzz and Wanda snap alert.
     Over the CRASHING of the WAVES -- did Wanda hear
     something?


<b>     EXT. BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Eve rushes to the car -- it's empty.  Jamie is gone.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Jamie?  Jamie!

     BULLETS SHRED the WINDOWS behind her.


<b>     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
     During the GUN BATTLE -- we INTERCUT the deaths of
     Dietrich, Lars and Sasha WITH:


<b>     EXT. SEA - LAZARRO'S ASHES
</b>
     being scattered at sea.

     Castor and Lars RIDDLE Sasha.  She drops.  Archer FIRES
     back -- killing Lars and driving Castor back.

     Archer leans beside the mortally-wounded Sasha.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>               ... Help Adam... don't let him end
               up like us...

     She dies in his arms.  Wounded, Dietrich crawls over.
     Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror...

<b>                             DIETRICH
</b>               Sasha -- !

     BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Castor wastes Dietrich.  Archer BLASTS
     back -- driving Castor outside.  Archer pursues.


<b>     EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY
</b>
     Eve runs smack into Wanda and Buzz -- they're on the run.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               We heard gunshots --

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Wanda, I've got to tell you
               something.  Something crazy...


<b>     EXT. BOATHOUSE YARD - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</b>
     Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats.
     Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun.

     Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths.
     Hearing a NOISE behind him --

     BOOM!  Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair
     hull.  He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when
     Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two
     steps -- until --

     Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps.

     The men collapse hard.  Castor's pistol clatters across
     the yard toward the docked boat.

     Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging
     their fingers deep into their throats.  They throttle
     each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is
     dislodged.

     His VOICE CHANGES, ECHOING with garbled.  STATIC.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Give up, Castor.  People are going
               to find out.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Not if I kill you first.

     They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from
     the docked boat and picks it up.  Archer and Castor stop
     dead in their tracks because --

     Jamie appears, holding the pistol.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Give it here, Jamie.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               No, Jamie.  Don't do it!

     Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now...

     Both speaking in Archer's true voice.

     And nobody is more confused than Jamie.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Listen to my voice, Jamie.  I'm
               your father.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               It's a trick, Jamie.  I'm your
               father.

     Jamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Shoot him, Jamie.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Jamie...

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Shoot him!

     Jamie FIRES.  Archer reels -- as a slug grazes his
     shoulder.  Castor snatches the PISTOL from Jamie's hand.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               You dunce.  No kid of mine would
               miss so badly.

     He aims the gun at Archer's head.

<b>                             WANDA (O.S.)
</b>               Hold it.

     Wanda and Buzz have burst onto the terrace -- their guns
     leveled.  Eve and more agents are right behind.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Just saving the taxpayers the cost
               of a trial.  So take a hike.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               You're both under arrest until a
               D.N.A. test proves who's who.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               I'm ordering you to back off!

     Several agents waver -- unsure.  But not Wanda and Buzz.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               Put the gun down --

<b>                             BUZZ
</b>               -- Now!

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>                      (beat)
               Can't blame me for trying.

     He grabs a shocked Jamie -- shoving the gun under her
     chin.

     Archer struggles to his feet as --

     Castor -- using Jamie as a shield -- backs out the gate
     to the garden.  Archer follows -- cautiously.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Say goodbye to Daddy --

     Jamie whips out the switchblade -- sinks it into Castor's
     thigh and twists.  She dives away.  FIRING wildly, Castor
     staggers back through the gate.

<b>                             CASTOR (O.S.)
</b>               You ungrateful delinquent!


<b>     OUTSIDE GATE
</b>

     As Castor turns and staggers away -- he runs smack into a
     confused security agent.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               Give me your weapon -- now!

     The agent hands over his UZI -- and Castor PLUGS him.


<b>     BOATYARD
</b>
     Archer and Eve make sure Jamie's okay.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>                      (to Archer)
               Who are you?  Will someone please
               tell me what's going on?

     Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open.


<b>     CASTOR
</b>
     limps away from the boatyard, towards the slips -- alive
     with sunbathers and yachters.


<b>     EXT. MARINA DOCKS - DAY
</b>
     Castor hustles along until he finds what he's looking
     for --

     Twin Cigarette BOATS -- racing boats -- being TUNED UP by
     their suntanned crews.  He jumps into one of the boats.

<b>                             BOAT CAPTAIN
</b>               Hey -- !

     Without even looking, Castor SHOOTS the guy dead.  In a
     flash -- Castor THROTTLES up the BOAT.  He sees --


<b>     CASTOR'S POV
</b>
     Archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat.


<b>     CASTOR
</b>
     FIRES -- peppering the dock.

     Archer knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the BAIT
     HOUSE BLOWS UP behind him.  Archer rolls into the boat --
<b>     FIRING.
</b>
     Castor's hit!  A slug grazes his shoulder.  He grabs the
     THROTTLE -- taking off.


<b>     ARCHER
</b>
     FIRES UP the second BOAT -- in pursuit.  Castor BLASTS
     back -- SHATTERING Archer's BOAT COMPASS.


<b>     CIVILIAN BOAT
</b>
     speeds toward him -- causing a near-miss.


<b>     ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
     Running parallel, Archer and Castor BLAST at EACH OTHER
     at point-blank range.  Their boats smash and pound each
     other.

     A police boat closes in on them.

     Castor FIRES at the police -- obliterating both crew and
     boat.  The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's
     craft.

     Archer's BOAT plows up and through the other.  EXPLOSION!
     Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the
     water.

     The boat lands right next to Castor's.

     Archer and Castor resume their battering... approaching
     a --


<b>     TUG
</b>
     pulling a barge.

     Castor forces Archer into its path.  At the last
     moment...

     Archer leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as --

     KA-BOOM!  Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which
<b>     EXPLODES.
</b>

<b>     CASTOR
</b>
     swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off.

     Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip.

     But the boat hits a wave...

     Castor loses the gun -- which skids away.  Archer slips,
     his head hanging over the side.  Castor tries to ram
     Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time.

     Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it.  WHUNK!  It sinks
     into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around
     his neck.

     As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts
     Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain.
     Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water.

     Archer tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds
     toward --


<b>     PIER
</b>
     Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT
     BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings.  But as they slug it out...


<b>     ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
     WHAM!  The BOAT careens off a piling -- and ROARS
     straight for the shipyard.  COLLIDING with a shoreline
     obstruction --

     The BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow...

     Archer and Castor go flying... onto the beach.


<b>     EXT. BEACH - DAY
</b>
     Archer and Castor lie dazed... then stir.  Castor sees
     the pistol lying half-buried... he reaches for it.
     But --

     Archer gets it first.  He aims it at Castor as they rise.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               You won't shoot me, Jon.  I'm
               unarmed...

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               Okay, I have a confession to
               make... but you aren't gonna like
               it... You're right, I won't shoot
               you.  Not in the face anyway.

     BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest!  He jerks and
     reels -- dropping to his knees.  He looks at Archer in
     total disbelief.  Then he sinks to the ground and lies
     still.

     Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop.  Then he turns
     and sees an FBI chopper heading his way.  Relieved, he
     turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone!

     Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning
     stabilizing screw.  Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the
     leg.  He buckles... but keeps going.

     Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to
     bury his face on the spinning blade.

<b>                             CASTOR
</b>               It'll never be over, Jon... every
               time you look in the mirror...
               you'll see my face...

     They struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer,
     closer -- slicing into "Archer's" cheek.  At the last
     instant...

     Archer reaches the anchor-chain.  He wraps it around the
     screw -- stopping the whirling blades.

     Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer
     moves.

     Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his
     wedding ring.  Just when he almost has it off -- Castor
     suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight.

     Eye contact between the two men.  Castor smirks, his
     grasp slackening... as he finally fades away.  Archer
     lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own
     finger.


<b>     ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
     The chopper lands.  Buzz and Wanda rush over.

<b>                             BUZZ
</b>               You okay, Archer?

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               What did you call me?

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               He called you 'Archer' -- sir.

     Archer finally realizes -- they actually mean him.  He
     smiles -- Jon Archer's long lost smile.


<b>     EXT. SHIPYARD - SUNSET
</b>
     FBI med-teams strap Archer onto a gurney.  Castor's inert
     body is beside him.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               Hang on, Jon... they're bringing
               in their top surgical team from
<b>               D.C...
</b>
<b>                             ARCHER
</b>                      (re:  Castor)
               How is he?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               No life signs at all.  He's a
               turnip.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               That's what they always say...

     He passes out as the FBI medics load him onto the med-
     evac chopper.  Wanda prevents Eve from climbing aboard.

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               I'm sorry, Eve.  You can't come.
                      (to Buzz)
               Take her home.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               But he's my husband!

<b>                             WANDA
</b>               But he works for us.

     Wanda gets on the med-evac chopper; it lifts off, leaving
     a furious Eve and a confused Jamie behind.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               Will Dad be Dad again?

<b>                             EVE
</b>               I hope so, honey.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               And you guys say my life is
               screwed up...

     In the swirl of dust, they watch the chopper fly away.


<b>     INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Maybe days, maybe weeks later -- no way to tell.  Eve is
     at the dining room table, catching up on medical reports.

     Sensing something, she looks up and sees a silhouette at
     the front screen door -- a man's silhouette.

<b>                             ARCHER (O.S.)
</b>               Hello, Eve.

     Pulse pounding, Eve frantically pushes open the door to
     glimpse the face of the man with Archer's voice.

     It's Jon Archer.  Eve stares -- then touches his face
     carefully, tenderly -- around the tiny residual scar.
     Then, she pulls him tight -- holding on for dear life.

<b>                             JAMIE (O.S.)
</b>               Dad?

     Jamie is there.  Archer smiles -- gently, almost sadly --
     with a softness and genuineness that Castor Troy could
     never feel, could never fake.

     She rushes to him.  The whole family hangs on, hugging
     and kissing -- for the first time ever, really together.

<b>                             JAMIE
</b>               I'm sorry I shot you, Dad.  Am I
               grounded?

     Archer smiles and holds her tighter.  But as they draw
     Archer inside, he hesitates.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               I have something to ask you -- to
               ask both of you...

     He steps aside -- revealing Castor's son.

<b>                             ARCHER
</b>               This is Adam.  He needs a place to
               live... just for a little while.

     Eve looks at Archer -- she sees what this means to him
     and, what the hell, there's plenty of time now to talk.


<b>     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
</b>
     As the family heads inside, the door closes, shutting us
     out.

<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:

<b>     INT. MATTHEW'S OLD ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer gives Adam an old teddy bear -- rocking the child
     until he finally drifts off into dreamland.


<b>     INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Archer watches Jamie sleep.  He draws the comforter over
     her -- she stirs, and pulls it in tighter.


<b>     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Eve gets undressed... waiting for Archer.

<b>                             EVE
</b>               How was your first day back?

     No reply... Eve hears WATER RUNNING.  She approaches
     Archer, who's bent over the sink, washing his face.

<b>                             EVE
