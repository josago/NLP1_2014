           We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG -
           thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to

           Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm
           wearing.
           Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is
           at a table with several other people, all staring raptly

           mingle with the stars. But the
           Industry can't allow any
           mingling. Stars have to be kept
           away from civilians, have to be
           quarantined, so they don't become
           normal. Like us.
           They pass a ravishing HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS walking the other
           way. She looks curiously at the pig as she passes. Sidney
           stares after her, longingly.

           made of squares of flashing color, compensating with
           enthusiasm for what he lacks in coordination. The women on

          This is ALISON OLSEN (20s) smart, attractive, dressed in an

           The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees
           Sidney and winces. She takes out a book and pretends to
           read. The lift begins to rise again.
           Through it's glass doors we see the different floors
           passing, different publications - each a hive of sober,
           hard work. Sidney stares at them.

           The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively
           dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of
           granite and an air of superhuman froideur.
           Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares
           tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to
           the plunge in temperature.
           For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then
           Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a
           moment, gagging.
           The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of
           having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her.
           Alison closes her eyes.
           Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger
           and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back
           of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket.
           Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the
           offending item away.
           Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a
           vice-like grip.

           They turn to see a young woman standing across the pool
           from them. This is SOPHIE MAES - a natural beauty,
           statuesque, no make-up, hair simply pulled back.
           Sophie tries to walk around the pool to join them but finds
           she can't work her way through the crowd. She turns to her
           right but finds her way similarly blocked.
           She hesitates for a moment and then with a shrug climbs
           down into the pool, the water up to her chest, and begins
           to walk through the floating flowers towards them.
           Sidney stares at her, TRANSFIXED. Alison notices this with
           some contempt.
           Gradually everyone notices Sophie and stops to look.
           Having reached the other side, Sophie ascends the pool
           steps, laughing, her dress clinging to her: Venus rising
           from the waves. The Photographers appear, snapping merrily
           away.

           Sidney sits in front of his computer reading the on-line
           New York Post Page Six. A story on the previous night is
           accompanied by a large picture of Sophie in her clinging
           dress. Above the picture is the title Venus Envy. Sidney
           stares at the picture, entranced.

           changing suddenly.
           SIDNEY'S P.O.V - Elizabeth Maddox is walking down the
           corridor towards us, face set.
           Sidney keeps on walking, staring to one side of Elizabeth.
           As they draw level, the heel of one of Elizabeth's shoes
           snaps off and she lurches sideways, colliding with the wall
           before sprawling onto the floor in front of Sidney.
           Sidney hesitates. He notices Alison watching with baited
           breath from the other end of the corridor. For a moment
           nobody moves then Sidney steps over Elizabeth's prone form
           without a word and keeps on walking.

           She is holding her Chihuahua, Cuba, which is dressed in a
           tiny coat. Sidney DISAPPEARS UNDER THE DESK. We hear a RIP

           The Woman produces a Beat-Box from behind her back and
           switches it on. She drops her coat to reveal underwear and
           stockings underneath.
           Maddox stares in frozen horror as the STRIPPER dances over

           collective gasp from the room. Sidney can't stop laughing.
           Suddenly he notices everyone in the room is now staring at
           the door. He turns to see Mrs Harding and her girls
           standing, shell-shocked, in the doorway. Alarmed, Sidney
           side-steps in towards Bob.

           down. You're here with Sophie?
           How about doing your old Rabbi a
           favour and putting in a good word

           SLOW MOTION - we move in on Sidney, sitting at the table,
           listening to the Best Actress award. This is where we first
           met him.

<b>           SIDNEY (V.O.)
</b>           This is me at the Golden Globes.
           That's my Armani tuxedo. That's a
           Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm
           wearing. I'm inside. I'm at the
           centre of everything. I'm right
           where I wanted to be.

           to stand, having just won Best Actress.

           Sidney stares at her hands - she is wearing his gold ring.
           We move back into real time, sound swells up, thunderous
           applause. Sidney claps along with the others.
           Then he stands up and goes after Sophie.

</b>           I need my ring back.
           As if puzzled by her inability to make it to the stage,
           Sophie, still smiling, tries to pull her arm free. Eleanor
           is instantly beside them, trying to disengage Sidney's
           hand.

           me that ring and told me I had to
           give it to the One. She isn't the
           One.
           The applause is still going strong. TV Cameras move in on
           Sophie as she starts to struggle, her smile slipping.
           Sidney tries to pull the ring free from her finger.
           Officials move in.

           slung over shoulder. He stares out as the cab passes the
           entrance to a PARK. A sign advertises an outdoor screening
           of La Dolce Vita.

          is the remains of a picnic, with lit candles.
          Sidney smiles and starts towards her, then stops. She is
          sitting next to a MAN. As Sidney watches she rests her head
          on his shoulder.
          Sidney watches, numb, then turns to walk away...
          BOB stands in front of him in full drag, waving
          frantically. He starts to run towards Sidney, who sighs and
          closes his eyes - as if things weren't bad enough.
          Then Bob runs straight past him. Sidney turns to see the
          Man next to Alison standing up to embrace Bob. The two
          kiss.

          back onto the picnic blanket. Then he kisses her. As he
          does so he takes the RING and slips it into Alison's coat
          pocket.
          Then they begin to dance, cha-cha-chaaing happily at the
          back of the park, as the music swells, lit by the
          flickering light from the screen.
          Suddenly Sidney freezes, staring over Alison's shoulder to
          where we can see he has accidentally thrown her NOTEBOOK
          onto a lit candle.
          It is now ON FIRE.
          Sidney shoves Alison aside and dives for the book...
