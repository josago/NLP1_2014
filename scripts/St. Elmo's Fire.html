          to get worse before it gets better.

          Young professionals, graduate students, and precocious
          undergrads populate the P.J. Clarke-like bar/restaurant.
          Kirbo quickly goes back to work waiting tables. Alec gets
          rid of a group of rowdy undergrads sitting at two tables
          pushed together. He admonishes WALLY, the burly owner.

          four years.
          Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy (still with
          sax around his neck) take their usual chairs as Kirbo
          drops off a large pitcher of beer.

</b>          The best advice I can give you
          undergrads is to fail. Failure is
          a virtue in today's society. Human
          error is a badge of honor. If
          you're the alcoholic child of a
          celebrity, you can blame them and
          earn a year on the best-seller
          list. If you're a celebrity, your
          mistake will earn you a People
          magazine cover. It's post-
          Watergate morality. Take
          responsibility for your mistakes
          and make a quick buck while you're
          at it.

          She drives off in the Jeep. Billy fumbles with his pants
          and then turns toward his house. Felicia, holding their
          baby, stands watching from the porch. Obviously having
          seen most of this, she silently goes back into the house,.
          locks the door and turns out the light. Alone, drunk and
          bewildered, Billy starts moving away from the house real-

          it slides further than he had planned and almost hits
          it. Getting out and trudging through the snow, in his
          party clothes. he bangs on the door.

          thirty-year-old wrapped in a blanket. Dale comes from
          the bedroom, fastening a man's robe and staring at Kirbo
          in disbelief.

          His entire world has collapsed. He can't swear, shout
          or cry -- he can only dash toward the car frantically.
          Falling in the snow once or twice, he eventually jumps
          into the car and tries to peel out, but it just spins
          in the snow. Meanwhile Guy has put on heavy boots and
          comes running out to the car where Kirbo stands on the
          gas to no avail.

          to get out of there.

          sip from the steaming cup.

          Alec's nervousness turns to embarrassment as they both
          start to laugh. Old feelings surge.

<b>                         LESLIE

          They look at each other for a moment.
