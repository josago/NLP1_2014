<b>          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
          DAVID AAMES, JR., 32, swings out of bed and sits on the
          corner of his mattress. it's a chilly New York City
          morning. Early sunlight glows around the corner's of his
          curtains.

</b>          open your eyes...
          He reaches behind him to shut off a slim voice-activated
          clock-radio. He rises, a comforter draped around his
          shoulders, and heads to the bathroom.

<b>          INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
          David regards himself in the mirror of a beautifully-tiled
          and well-appointed bathroom. in his thirties now, his
          looks have only deepened and improved. He brushes his
          teeth. He spots a gray hair, and holding tweezers, seizes
          and plucks it.

<b>          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
          David puts on a shirt. Checks his wallet for money. His
          bedroom is elegant and spare.

</b>
          He slips down the stairs into the expansive living area of
          this deeply-textured apartment. A stunning, inherited book
          collection lines the walls.

          the New York City streets.

          David travels the side-streets to work. He senses a
          growing weirdness. The streets are empty. He looks at. his
          watch. It's        8:12.  He continues anxiously. Runs a red
          light. Music rises.

<b>          EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- MORNING
</b>
          The most recognized piece of real-estate in the world is
          silent. It is as if the world's biggest parade has just
          left, taking everybody with it. David pulls over
          haphazardly. He exits the car, leaving it in the middle of
          the street. He begins to walk, faster now, as music rises.
          All the electricity is on. There is absolutely nobody in
          sight. David begins to run, searching for humanity. The
          billboards - electronic and still - all sell easy solutions
          to his loneliness. He pulls up short., stopping and crying
          out in anguish. There is no one left in the world.

          David hangs out of bed, his mouth in an open silent scream.
          Covers his face with both hands.

</b>          . open your eyes...
          He reaches behind to shut off the same clock-radio, and its
          voice.  He makes a relieved agonized sound into the
          pillow. Gets up, sees a pizza box... a container of
          soup... a remote control on the floor. We hear an incisive
          voice with a comforting lilt - a man we'll meet later.

<b>          A MAN'S VOICE
</b>          Well, I suppose the empty street
          meant loneliness.

<b>          DAVID'S VOICE
</b>          You're a shrink. You've got to do
          better than that.

          stereotype each other. Not all

<b>          DAVID'S VOICE
</b>          What do you want to know? I was
          about to turn 33. I ran three
          magazines, and a world-wide
          publishing house. On most days I
          actually fooled myself into
          believing it would last forever.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
          David checks himself in the mirror. Seizes and plucks that
          same gray hair.

<b>          DAVID'S VOICE
</b>          Isn't that what being young is
          about? Believing secretly that
          you would be the one person, in
          the history of man, who would live
          forever?

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
          David enters, reaching for his wallet, repeating the
          morning ritual. A figure stirs in the bed behind him. She
          leans upward, wearing David's college basketball tank for a
          pajama-top. She's warm and wicked, a mildly reformed party
          girl, the kind of girl first-novels are written about. She
          is JULIANNA GIANNI,25.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Where you going so early?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (slightly self-conscious)
          Hey, don't record any more
          messages on my alarm--clock, okay?

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Why not?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I'll think we're married or
          something.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Don't you ever say that word. Or
          I'll never come over here and
          bring you chicken soup and fuck
          your brains out again.

<b>          DAVID  (U.S..)
</b>          I guess you took my mind off it.
          She pulls a pink pill-box purse from the nightstand,
          withdraws a multi-colored phone.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Reyna, it's Julianna. I missed my
          audition.
          (dramatic, like Bette Davis)
          I lost my head. Listen, I have to

          David in his steel-and-linoleum bachelor kitchen. Julie
          swings into view. Her blouse is unbuttoned two buttons
          too many, down to mid-chest. She gives him a kiss on the
          cheek and lingers. David grabs a racquetball bag, talks to
          the next. room.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Help yourself to whatever you
          want. Set the alarm, Maria will
          clean up. Lock up when you go.
          And... you are the greatest.

</b>          Bye "honey!"

          They have a comfortable, healthy, mutually satisfying,

          David is about to enter the green sports car, then thinks
          better of it. He fires up a knock-around beater car from
          his collection. He drives into the street which is,
          comfortingly, now full of people. We hear R.E.M.'s "All
          The Right Friends."

<b>          EXT. NEW YORK SIDE-STREETS - DAY

          David drives the crowded streets.        It all seems more
          poignant today. Life is good again.

<b>          EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
          David pulls up to a lower-end apartment, checks his watch.
          Enter the hung-over BRIAN SHELBY,        30ish. In a world of
          acquaintances, Brian is a true friend.   He has all the
          qualities of Abe Lincoln and, much to his chagrin, the
          looks too. He hops in the car with racquetball bag.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Did you reserve the court?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Easy. I can't handle heavy
          conversation at this ungodly hour.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I'm sorry to do this early. I
          gotta be done by 10.
          Car phone rings. David checks Caller ID - it's his office.
          He clicks on.

          colors of the letters for the new
          issue of Rise.

</b>          What are the colors?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          And that was the desire of my

</b>          (suspicious pause)
          You fucked Julie Gianni again,

          David takes off driving.

          Oh, no man, I've got a cold. I'm
          hanging in tonight.

</b>          My dream girl... Julie Gianni...

          Brian emits another pained howl. David reaches over to
          change the music.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          What do you want to listen to?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Slow down, man.

</b>          What have we got here - Barcelona,

          Brian freezes at what he sees.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Look out! Look out!
          David turns and sees he's hurtling into the back of a car
          stopped just in front of him. Clenching he hits the
          brakes, narrowly avoiding a high-speech collision. And
          then... to his right... another car comes hurtling toward
          him... and stops within an inch of deadly impact.           There
          is an awful moment, as the second car blares on the horn.
          Traffic continues, but the lingering feeling of dread and
          confusion is still in the air.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Fuck!

          David meets Peter Brown and RACHEL, his second assistant,
          at. the front of the well-appointed headquarters of Aames
          Publications. Aames hops out of car and heads into the
          building.

<b>          INT. AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY

          David Aames Jr. turns down the corridor of Rise Magazine, a
          male youth-culture-style magazine. Rachel gives him daily
          tabloid reports, continues with the essentials.

<b>          RACHEL
</b>          The art department needs a
          decision on the colors. Yellow-

          board is pissed you're late.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You changed your hair.
          David taps on the window of the art department, in panic
          over several cover mock-ups. He gives a presidential
          thumbs-up, moves on. They look at each other, trying to
          decipher if the thumbs-up was a decision.

<b>          ART EDITOR
</b>          Did he mean the yellow-and-red or

          David passes a holdover from the old days, older
          Receptionist       (BEATRICE) who speaks uncomfortably and
          gruffly into a headset. She gives David a knowing look -
          late again.

          David walks into the office. Framed original photos from

          books. Seven very-interested and very-alert looking Older

          we hear his voice but we do not see him. It is the

</b>          David - the part where we parry
          and joust, and get to know each
          other bit-by-bit... we're going to
          have to skip it. You've been
          charged with murder. In four

          A Contentious Prison Guard (AARON) swings his feet down and
          gets up from watching a 17-inch television on a stool. He
          exits into the bigger room to quiet down David Aames.

</b>          You want me to help -

</b>          Take it easy, Face. Your whole

          With great power, McCabe advances on the guard. His
          presence, when he turns on the switches, is considerable.

<b>          MCCABE.
</b>          Stop! Please leave. Right now.

</b>          McDonald's, not once, and never
          watched television. Yet his
          biggest magazine is still TV
          Digest. He and my mother threw
          the grandest parties of the
          literary world. He ballooned,
          jumped from planes, sought
          adventure... His autobiography is
          the manual for every cutthroat
          publisher in New York. It's
          called Defending the Kingdom.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          I've read it. Page  127.           "David
          Junior was a delight as a child."
          Did I miss something here? Is
          that all he wrote about you?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I don't think he ever got over the
          fact that I was terrified of
          heights. And when he and my
          mother were run over by a drunken
          teenager on New Year's Eve, ten
          years ago...
          David Aames moves closer to the light. We see a strange
          bland expression of his mask, at first other--worldly... and
          then more clearly.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          he left the keys to the
          Kingdom to me...    51% control,   49%
          going to a group of seven board
          members who all thought they were
          first in line.

</b>          And you believe the Board, the
          Seven Dwarves, put you here to
          take control of your company.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          What do you care?

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          We're just talking. And tonight's
          Wednesday night, and I go to Black
          Angus for dinner with my daughters
          on Wednesday nights, so I'll have
          to leave soon. You understand

          McCabe gathers his things.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          With all the respect I can offer a
          man wearing a latex mask and
          spouting conspiracy theories,
          David, trust me - you've crossed
          that bridge.

</b>          Fine. Enjoy your dinner.
          Somehow the lilt in McCabe's voice draws him closer.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          There are five basic emotions in
          life. Tell me. what emotion
          gripped... him... before he

          Shadows. There is no answer, just a rustling and a growing
          sense of anticipation in the darkness.

          Shadows. Still no answer.

          McCabe now shows the invisible skill with which he has
          brought his client to the precipice. And now, with one
          word, he invites David Aames to look over.

</b>          Love?
          In the darkness, a rustling and the slight turn of a head.

<b>          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT/BACK ROOM OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
          From the darkened back room, David Aames appears with ice,
          and re-enters his party.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Who needs ice?
          Aames moves swirls is more like it - through into his
          party, which is nicely underway. Upscale. Modern. Part
          literary crowd. Part fashion crowd.       He's great in a
          crowd. Surrounded by people, David Aames comes alive.

<b>          DAVID MOVES THROUGH PARTY
</b>          catching the attention of a model.        (LYNETTE)

<b>          LYNETTE
</b>          David! Happy Birthday.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Jesus, you have the greatest taste
          in shoes I've ever seen. Bar
          none. Anywhere.
          A Woman Caterer in Whites    (EMMA) slips by with a knowing
          smile.

<b>          EMMA THE CATERER
</b>          The old place sure looks more
          crowded with people in it.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Emma, do you know Lynette?

<b>          EMMA THE CATERER
</b>          No, but I shudder to think what. we
          might have in common.
          David notices that Brian Shelby has arrived with a guest, a
          Woman who struggles with a package and a very large coat.
          On first glance, she's just another girl. On second
          glance, she's a killer. He notes her oddly funny behavior.
          She removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural
          beauty. She is SOFIA SERRANO, a 27 year-old city girl with
          a barely containable life-force. Enter PETER BROWN,
          David's male assistant with surreptitious headset. He
          gestures to a stereo appliance set up in David's living
          room.

</b>          The Living Stereo system is online

</b>          amazing prototype. They'd love an
          article on it if you like it...
          David nods, still focused on Sofia. Suddenly, he finds he
          can't take his eyes off her.

<b>          PETER BROWN
</b>          and happy birthday, sir.

<b>          ANGLE ON FRONT ENTRANCE
</b>          as David arrives to greet Brian and his guest.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Hey man. Happy birthday and all
          the usual shit people say to each
          other. How you doing?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Livin' the dream, baby. Livin'
          the dream.
          The two friends hug. David shares a quick glance with
          Brian's date, who still burdened with coat.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          (to Sofia, as in 'meet the
          notorious...')
          Meet David Aames.

</b>          (can't help but flirt)
          And to what do I owe this
          pleasure, the pleasure of --

</b>          (playful)
          -- the pleasure of Sofia. Serrano.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          We met today at the library, if
          you can believe that --

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I'm sorry about my coat. It's too
          big for your closet.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          - we were both pretending to be
          intellectuals.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No no, I think it's amazing. I
          love your coat.

</b>          I overdressed. I mean I
          underdressed.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I'll just continue like you're
          both actually listening to me.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (to David)
          Do you have another room to put it
          in?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          (invisible, re: their chemistry)
          I have ceased to exist.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Well, Madison Square Garden is
          nearby, it might fit there.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (shoves David playfully,
          as in touche)
          Happy Birthday.
          Her upbeat physicality is intoxicating. Sofia hands David
          her present.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          We picked it out together.
          Neither look at Brian. Brian takes a breath. He's been
          here before.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Thank you.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          We picked it out together. We...

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Welcome.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Stop flirting and open it.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Okay.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Let's get a drink.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Okay.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I'll leave this upstairs.
          David exits. They are left to consider his personal
          charisma.

<b>          ANGLE ON A HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY CONNECTED TO STEREO
</b>          An odd and disarmingly beautiful display of Coltrane
          performing "My Favorite Things" in David's living room.
          Sofia passes a hand through Coltrane's image, admires it.

<b>          ON DAVID
</b>          David is approached by THOMAS TIPP, a Brit, and an
          Associate board-member at Aames Publications. Tipp is ten
          years older than David, and he is the rarest of birds. A
          sentimental lawyer. And at the moment he's a bit drunk.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hey Tommy.
          David moves to address him so he can still track Sofia.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          Hey.  Listen to me. Don't blow
          me off. I'm all packed, I'm going
          back to London and I understand.
          You put me up for that other
          attorney's job, so you didn't have
          to fire me. A classy move, and
          your father would have done the
          same ---

<b>          DAVID
</b>          It's okay, Tommy --

<b>          TIPP
</b>          I became incompetent. Is there
          anything more unbecoming than an
          aging mascot? I cared about your
          father. I lived and breathed for
          him. But these guys, the board,
          they think you're stupid.  A
          corporate hazard, a rogue.
          But the word "stupid" is what David heard loudest of all.
          Nearby, we see a Woman Partner          (one of the Seven Dwarves)
          taking a quick look at David.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          But they're going to find a way to
          get you out. They're lined up for
          your office -
          David scans the room. Beneath the good cheer, he sees the
          other layer. Lying. Disloyalty. All part of the
          institution he enjoys forgetting exists. Each word bashes
          his soul.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          -- your job. Your life. Your
          position. They are working day
          and night. to cheat you out of your
          51% vote. And they are going to
          sell this tradition, this
          tradition of words, so they can
          eat at a better cafeteria. And
          what they don't know is this -
          (gestures grandly to
          books that surround
          them)
          - people will read again.
          David's gaze falls upon Sofia, who is looking directly at
          him. And for one blinding moment, something passes between
          them. She looks away. He feels saved.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (interrupting with
          finality)
          I got it.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          They even have a nickname for you
          behind your back.
          David smiles faintly. Understandingly.   Tipp kisses him
          on the cheek, boldly and drunkenly. He feels like a hero
          to himself.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          Citizen Dildo.
          David flinches, just a little.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          Now you've got great instincts.
          But I say this with complete love.
          Claim your life... Learn to be an
          Asshole... Don't be         -

          Okay. Forgive me. I still
          believe in this family. Even if
          it's only you.
          David continues tracking Sofia as he slips over to Peter
          Brown.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Get Tipp out of here, drive him
          home, and in the morning tell him
          he's re-hired with a 50% raise.
          Set up a meeting with the other
          attorneys. I'm going to be in

          Four is pretty good?

          She pulls away, and talks plainly to him.

          right way, and I'll lose my

          resists. She gets the message.

          Sofia eyes a framed smashed guitar handsomely mounted in a
          glass display case.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          So this is what's become of rock
          and roll. A smashed guitar behind
          a glass case displayed on some
          rich guy's wall.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          It was a gift, actually.
          She turns and sees it's David, engaging smile in place.
          She jumps slightly.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (apologetic)
          I like it.
          She turns and walks away, David following close behind.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Whoa, whoa, whoa.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          - how did you get all this stuff,
          this apartment, this life -
          David is looking just over her shoulder. She turns to see
          an almost disturbingly large portrait of David Aames, Sr.
          She turns back.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I see.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          How about if you help me? Unless
          I'm horning in here.

          I've got a stalker.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          It doesn't. sound life-threatening.
          Someone passes, bumping her slightly, into him.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I need a cover. I need for you to
          pretend we're having a
          scintillating conversation. And
          you're wildly entertained. I know
          it's tough.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I'll improvise    -

<b>          DAVID
</b>          She's right across the room and
          she's burning a hole in my back
          right now, isn't she?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Red dress, strappy shoes?

</b>          Yes_

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Shit.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          And she seems to be growing...
          less happy.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hmm.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I think she's the saddest girl to
          ever hold a martini.
          Julie Gianni sits on the steps watching. The girl, and the
          dress, looked much happier in the bedroom. Julie rises and
          begins to move.

          David and Sofia race up the stairs. Bad kids having fun.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          You have another apartment?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Sort of a day office. Come on -
          They arrive at the door to a smaller upstairs apartment.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I'm not going in there.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Well I am. Goodnight.
          He enters and shuts the door. Frustrated, she stands for    a
          moment, listening to the music streaming from the
          downstairs apartment. We watch her private moment as she
          decides to leave him, turns, feels the emotional pull,
          dances back and knocks sharply three times.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I hear her coming.

<b>          DAVID (0.5.)
</b>          Really?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          No.
          David pulls her inside. Shuts the door behind them.

</b>          This is Joni Mitchell. This one

<b>          DAVID

          It's the real thing. His

          David and Sofia laugh.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You know what I think? You're
          either a very good actress or you
          really do sort of like me.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I am an actress.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          There's probably not too much you

          the door opens.

<b>          BRIAN

</b>          Nobody stalks me. So I drink.

<b>          DAVID

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Here, finish my Jack and Coke.
          He messily tries to hand his drink to David, but spills it
          embarrassingly. All his cool is gone, and what's left are
          his friends covering for him, cleaning up.

</b>          These stupid glasses        -

          something. Jacks and Cokes?
          She exits, leaving the two friends.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I better hit it. I drank too much
          and I didn't fucking eat.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Don't be stupid. The party's just

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Fuck you, David. You're paying me
          to write my novel, so you own me.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I don't own you. You're
          brilliant, you're good-looking,
          you're handsome.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          But why'd you have to hit on
          Sofia?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No one's hitting on Sofia.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Fine. Whatever you say.               I'm
          crazy, I'm blind.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No, you're not blind. You're just
          drinking Jack Daniels. And when
          you drink Jack, you start. in with
          that Frank Sinatra, "She Shot. Me
          Down," gimme a cigarette, King of

</b>          But wait. You're rich and women
          love you and I'm from Ohio and I'm
          drunk. Can I tell you the truth?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Everyone does.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I dig her.        And I've never said
          this to you before, about any
          girl. But she could be... could
          be could be could be... the girl
          of my fuckin dreams.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You're not from Ohio.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I know.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          But if she fucks tip our friendship
          - she can go to hell. I won't
          allow it!         We are bros.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I feel the same way.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          (wishes he believed it)

          over)
          I'm just humoring myself that my
          opinion matters.
          Brian looks at the two of them. Life is telling him, and
          he knows it's time to go. Portrait of a man who will not
          get what. he wants. David notes the poetry in his friend.

<b>          BRIAN

          alone. Because without. the
          bitter, baby, the sweet ain't as
          sweet. Have a good time.
          He exits like a champ, a glorious sad-sack, with a hand
          flourish.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          A lot of people are scared of

          She switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl
          apartment. A life is lived here, a bed on the back-room
          floor, a bag of trash on the counter, lamp is askew. She
          makes no attempt to clean it up. He soaks in the details,
          including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and
          shelves.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Hey Paulo!
          A large goofy dog comes running at her, and then proceeds
          to slather David with love too.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I'm glad he protects you. This is
          a lethal canine.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (from other room)
          I love living here. And I refuse
          to clean up!

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No problem.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I've got to work around the clock
          to keep this place.
          David eases the dog away as he examines the oddly exquisite
          dolls. He grabs a look at her in the other room. A bit of
          leg between boot and skirt.  As he admires the dolls:

<b>          DAVID
</b>          So you're really a dancer, huh?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          For     14     years.   But I don't dance
          like you dance.

</b>          Do you want something to drink?

<b>          DAVID

          An odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos

          passionate life.
          Shot moves across the photos. A young girl living a young
          girl's hard-working and happy life. Group photos of co-
          workers. A few from a vacation. A whole new cast of
          characters, all committed, and they all look inviting to
          him. And one gloriously random photo of her in Cabo San
          Lucas, raising a toast with friends.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I like your life.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Well, it's mine and you can't have
          it.
          David examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of
          a sloshed Sofia, a guy's arm reaching for her breast.
          Dedication reads: To Sergio! Marry me!

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I do not want to know the story
          behind this photo. Who's Sergio?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          It's a nickname.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Your nickname is Sergio?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          It's a long story, and we don't
          know each other.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          So many secrets.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          That's because I'm really an arms

          Although. It must be hard
          controlling all those people's
          lives. Everyone at that party is
          connected to you for survival in
          some way, it seems.
          David looks at her, mentally assessing her level of guile.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Ever been married?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No. Ever accept any of your
          12,000 proposals?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (playful, self-
          deprecating)
          12,008.No.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          And you moved to New York. To
          dance and paint and act and deal
          arms.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Right.
          (going through CDs)
          Do you want to hear Jeff
          Buckley... or Vikki Carr?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Jeff Buckley... or Vikki Carr?
          Both - simultaneously.
          He continues looking. Flashes of the photos on her
          refrigerator.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Everyone said "don't go to New
          York." But I just think good

          good person with a good attitude.
          Doncha think?
          He regards her.  He's a little restless, and a lot
          enchanted. Is she for real?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          You think I'm naive.
          He decides she's for real. He turns back to the photos on
          her fridge.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No. I really don't.

<b>          DAVID (V.0.)
</b>          I dug her completely. Somehow, I
          had found the last semi-guileless
          girl in New York City.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I have to get to sleep.
          Truthfully -- I'm also working
          mornings as a dental assistant.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (to himself)
          Boy, am I going to the wrong
          dentist.

<b>          MCCABE(V.0.)
</b>          And you didn't immediately want to
          sleep with her?

<b>          DAVID (V.0.)
</b>          Well you know - I'm a pleasure
          delayer.

<b>          MCCABE (V.O.)
</b>          (interested in his
          romantic style)
          How does that work?

<b>          DAVID (V.0.)
</b>          (toying with the shrink)
          Pleasure delaying... you don't
          know? You keep the relationship
          casual until the absolute breaking
          point.And then, one night, or
          afternoon, or morning... it could
          be months from now... oh, you know
          how it works -

          Sofia's photos. A single crimson cloud.

</b>

<b>          WEEK/INTERROGATION # 2
</b>          David sits with the mask, facing McCabe. McCabe is hanging
          on every word.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          - actually no I don't. I've been
          married for twenty-two years.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Ah, you've got dinner with your
          daughters.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          That's right. I do.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Back then I had intricate systems
          with women you wouldn't believe.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Like... what...

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hey Doc. Don't get all melancholy
          over the thirty seconds you were
          single a long time ago.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          That's what you think I'm doing?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Yes.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Well, you may have a point.
          Let's continue. Time is not our
          friend.

<b>          INT. AARON'S CUBLICLE/PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - DAY
</b>
          Aaron watches David, a 17-inch television on a stool to his
          right. Again, strangely, it is "To Kill A Mockingbird"
          that he's watching. We hear audio from the movie through
          the glass.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM NIGHT
</b>
          David with artist's notebook in hand. Across the table,
          Sofia holds the other notebook.

</b>
<b>          DAVID
</b>          Just our shortcomings. That's all
          we're allowed to draw.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (confidently)
          I've never drawn such a true
          likeness before.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Mine's finished.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Already? Hang on. Okay - done.
          Sofia offers her drawing. It's a caricature of a good-
          looking guy surrounded by money, cars and very thin girls.
          He snatches it, studies it, and what he sees hurts him in
          surprising ways.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (embarrassed laugh)
          Jesus. That's how you see me?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Maybe I didn't add enough money --

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No. It's wonderful. It's
          something you'd see on the wall of
          a steak-house in hell, but it's
          wonderful. Sign it.
          Sofia's face falls a bit. She sees she's hurt him. She
          takes the drawing and signs it, a little guilty.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Let's see yours.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No.
          She grabs it. Its a rich portrait, filled with detail,
          humor and style. She is rocked by its elegance.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Wow. I feel bad.
          (regarding it carefully)
          You said to draw a caricature.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I know. I couldn't. I saw you
          like that.

<b>

</b>
<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Well, it's very good.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I'll sell it to you.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          You monster. How much for?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          One kiss.
          She smiles. Something is developing between them.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          That smile is gonna be the end of
          me.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (serious)
          And what happens when your friend
          calls you tomorrow?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          He only met you a few hours before
          me. He would do the same.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I see that friendship is important
          to you.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          It is. But as his best friend, I
          also know that he's trying to
          finish a novel about inadequacy
          and rejection. So the longer I
          stay, the better it is for his
          career.
          Sofia smiles, shakes her head. And yawns.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Your career is one I'd worry
          about.
          David looks down. She's hit a nerve.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I'm sorry -

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No, no. You're more right then
          you even know. I used to be one
          of those guys who was just

<b>          
</b>
<b>          36
</b>          snowboarding through his life,
          with no focus whatsoever.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          When did you change?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (pause, confesses)
          About five minutes ago.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (direct, slightly
          whimsical)
          Every passing minute is another
          chance to turn it all around.
          David shakes his head a little. Her words strike right to
          the heart of him.

<b>          DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER
</b>
          Sofia is asleep on the sofa. Clothes still on.               David
          gently strokes her hair.    Television in b.g. It's one of
          those late-night infomercials, and it's ridiculously
          compelling. The perfect thing to bond over on a great,
          lingering date.

<b>          INTERVIEWER ON T.V.
</b>          And to those who think that you're
          a charlatan?

<b>          OLDER MAN ON T.V.
</b>          I understand. The perception of a
          head frozen somewhere waiting for
          reanimation - it sounds like
          science fiction.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          What are you watching?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          It's the greatest show... it's
          called "Sofia."
          Sofia looks at him and smiles. They look back to the
          television.

<b>          ON TV INFOMERCIAL
</b>          A charming looking older-man discusses eternal life with a
          television interviewer.

</b>
<b>          37
</b>
<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (off t.v.)
          I've seen this thirty times.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          We did a story on this guy. He
          owns half of Arizona.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Is he a fraud?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          How would you ever know?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Good point.

<b>          INTERVIEWER ON T.V.
</b>          Can you unfreeze a human life?

<b>          OLDER MAN ON T.V.
</b>          Take the case of Benny the dog.
          Benny is a dog who was frozen for
          three months, and thawed out to
          live a normal life.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Oh, well that's comforting. It's
          safe for Benny. I'm in!
          David moves closer to her.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          We better watch out.
          They regard each other, and David gets up off the sofa.
          It's true. The promise is too great to not savor it, and
          walk away for now. Thrill remains in the air.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Where are you going?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I left my number on your fridge.
          He makes a courtly bow and turns. She feels the loss of
          his company.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Come here, I want to tell you a
          secret.
          He pauses a moment, and turns. In this instant, a fleeting
          instant, it's the oddest thing. He can see their entire

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          38
</b>          life together. He returns to her. Tentatively, she grabs
          a quick sweet kiss on his mouth. He stays for an extra
          moment, kissing just her upper lip, leaving no doubt as to
          the potential of their future. And then... very close she
          says:

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I meant that to be your forehead.
          David stands. He looks around the small apartment.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Thank you for the inspiration. I
          will now attempt to run my
          company, showing compassion for
          the seething throng of my partners
          who root quietly for me to fail.
          She looks at him, quite aware of his personal and business
          crossroads. Silently, she roots for him like crazy.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          For things you don't even know -
          thank you. I'm going to go to
          work. I have a company to run.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Pleasure delayer.
          He is still somewhat stunned by the evening, and the girl.
          He actually wants to run his company.

<b>          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
          David slips out onto the street. It's shabbier than the
          alluring night-time version. He'd never notice, or care...
          because David is a man with a brand new buzz.                The city is
          his. Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable.
          Life feels like a great pop song. Behind him, a car with
          its lights still on starts and advances alongside.           Behind
          the wheel is Julianna Gianni.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          David Aames.
          David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Julie Gianni.     You're following
          me.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          only a little.    I wanted to
          finish what we were talking about.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>

</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          39
</b>
<b>          DAVID
</b>          And _-

<b>          JUL IANNA
</b>          How'd it work out with our Moth
          Girl? Did she turn into a
          butterfly for you?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Yes she did.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          But I can see from your walk that
          you didn't sleep with her.
          David turns.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Let me see if I can guess. You
          haven't slept with her because...
          it's more fun when you can draw it
          out. Sex just isn't as good if
          the woman hasn't told all her
          friends she'd never sleep with
          you.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You're right on the money, Julie.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          She must be exhausted from trying
          to be witty for you all night
          long.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hey, Julie.

<b>          JUL IANNA
</b>          Sorry. You're just never there
          for your friends until they've
          already given up on you.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I'm not blowing you off! I just
          want to be alone for a little bit.
          Trust me - I have a lot of things
          I gotta take care of. If we're
          friends, which we are, you'll
          understand.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          (simple, honest)
          I'm sorry I got weird. I missed
          an audition and I just felt bad

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          40
</b>          you didn't invite me to your
          party.
          It zings him. David turns, considers her.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Do you want to make it up to me?
          I won't tell a soul.
          Slowly, he is drawn to her. His old self rallies one last
          time. He gets in the car.

<b>          INT. JULIANNA'S CAR -- EARLY MORNING
</b>
          The streets are empty. She plays a CD of a romantic sweet
          pop track with a feeble vocal.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Would you do a story about me if I
          made a CD?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Sure I would -

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Do you like my music?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (winning, truthful)
          It's vivid.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          If I weren't me, I would buy a CD
          by me.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Well, you know, if you can reach
          one person.
          Julianna is a little hurt, hides it well.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          What is happiness to you, David?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (considering)
          what is happiness?

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          For me, this is happiness. Being
          with you.
          David doesn't look at her. She speeds up, slowly.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>          JU.LIANNA
</b>          One thing bothers me. Why did you
          tell Brian I was your fuck-buddy?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I didn't tell him that. I didn't
          say that.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          When did you stop caring?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (watching the road)
          About what --

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          About the consequences of the
          promises you made.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Promises         - I thought we had an

          pulls back to see he has covered the entire floor of his
          living room with memos and paperwork from Aames Publishing.
          He stands regarding all of this information, stooped and
          wearing his bathrobe.

<b>          DAVID POV (V.0.)
</b>          I'll just say it   - I did my
          homework. I read every memo.
          Thomas Tipp was right. People
          will read again.

          David stares at his screen. Disheveled, in underwear, he
          eats red--vine licorice and M&Ms.

<b>          DAVID (V.0.)
</b>          I attended the monthly board
          meeting of the Seven Dwarves by
          video hook-up. Oh, baby. This
          was war.
          On screen before him, all seven, and Thomas Tipp too. Shot
          moves in on screen. We can feel the cool tension of their
          imminent takeover. David twitches, feels it physically.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          because nobody's buying books

</b>          I grew stronger in ways I had
          never known before. And on

          the sky... the return of David
          Aames, Jr. Citizen Dildo.

<b>          INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY
</b>
          Sofia dances at the end of a long day. A few others leave
          for the day, trying not to stare at David. Sofia is there
          alone. For a moment, we share her solitude. She practices
          ballet, twisting and turning and landing in frame, looking
          just past camera. She freezes. She catches sight of
          David, undisguised. And she begins dancing again. Harder.
          Does she even recognize him? He moves closer, attempting
          an easy-going persona. We hear nothing but the sound of
          his heart pounding, in odd counter-rhythm to her dancing.
          Finally she stops.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You won't believe this... but this
          is me smiling.
          She laughs a little at his strange new humor, keeps a brave
          front.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          It's been a long time. I tried to
          see you but your people wouldn't
          let me.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I didn't want to see me, okay.
          But then I woke up today and
          finally, a good hair day.
          David fights anxiety, smoothes his coat.

          Sure.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          What?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Let's go out and do something.

</b>          This weekend. I'll cancel an
          operation or two. We'll have fun.
          Because I am all about fun.
          She kisses his cheek, pulls back quickly, and as she
          exits... he sees her fighting tears.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          David's mirror is restored. He studies himself. Raises
          his arm higher than he has been able to. In the next room
          we hear Conan O'Brien welcoming:

<b>          CONAN (O.S.)
</b>          . please welcome, Benny the Dog.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          David watches Conan. The Owner of Benny sits with Benny
          himself. He wears a t-shirt reading: L.E. Benny is not
          the most excitable dog in town. In fact, he seems rather
          spacey.

<b>          CONAN (O.S.)
</b>          I have so many questions. To
          start off, tell us all just what
          has happened to Benny. What's
          Benny been through?

<b>          OLDER MAN/OWNER
</b>          Benny fell into the water near our
          home, and was frozen in the
          Skykomish River. And I went
          fishing, thinking he'd gone three
          months earlier', and there he was
          in a block of ice, and...
          David grabs the phone, and dials a number.

          complacency)
          He is thawed out, right?
          Laughter on the t.v. Riding the buzz of what he's
          watching, David dials.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hey listen, it's David. I'm back
          in your life. I saw you earlier
          tonight. I was just watching our
          old friend Benny the Dog on... on
          Conan... and I thought of you.
          (laughs)
          Whatever. I loved seeing you
          today. So I'll see you soon.
          You're a great dancer!
          He hangs up and feels instantly mortified. He looks at the
          phone in his hand.

<b>          INT. CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
          David moves into the thick of a high-energy neighborhood
          dance club. He wears a facial prosthetic. In the
          darkness, he doesn't stick out, not much. He spots Sofia
          and Brian, chatting, waiting for him. The sight of the two
          together recalls happier times. Sofia is dressed down.
          Brian, on the other hand, has never looked better. His
          clothes are nicer. He wears them with confidence. David
          has practiced an opening joke, clapping his hands together.
          He will be trying too hard, all night long.
          They regard him in the mask.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I am in the mood for cheap sugary
          overpriced rum-and-cokes. You
          want one?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (spreads arms)
          Is there any other kind?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I'll go get us some         -

</b>          Where's the bathroom?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Behind... over by the place next
          to the door by the chick... I
          mean, girl who looks like Bjork.
          She leaves. David turns to Brian immediately.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You look good, man. How's your
          book?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Take it off.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I can't. It's a facial shield.
          It's an antiseptic prosthesis to
          stop infections. These fucking
          doctors.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          (with all love)
          Take off the mask! It's freaking
          me out.

</b>          I can't. It's my face. This is
          my face.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Oh no. Trust me. It's a little
          different.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Sofia asked me.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          She didn't want to be alone with
          me?
          (Brian regrets his words)
          That's bullshit. Because I think
          I'm being pretty fucking cool
          about the whole thing.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Talk to a shrink!        Or you can
          call me sometime, instead of
          hiding in your apartment. Don't
          take it out on a girl you only met
          once.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (stung)
          Did she say that? I met her
          "once?" Did she say I met her
          "once?"
          Brian looks away. He's said too much.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Cut it out. I miss the old you.
          We all miss the old you. Because
          the new guy is shit.
          David turns away. The perfectly wrong thing to say.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Oh. Man. Wait. That came out
          wrong. I love you - period.
          How's your arm, man?
          David shakes his head, moves toward the bar.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Fuck you, Brian. How about no
          more sympathy? How about if
          that's the deal we make with each
          other? Okay?
          David shakes him off, goes to the bar, and rips off his
          mask. His head thuds from a migraine.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Gimme a Budweiser and a shot of
          tequila.

</b>          What did you say to me?

</b>          (leans closer, still
          looking down)
          I said - What. Kind. Of.
          Tequila.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Why don't you ask me to my face,
          bitch?
          The barman looks up, expressionless.

</b>          Patron. If you have it.

</b>          watching Sofia and Brian from a distance, talking as
          friends.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Another shot, another Bud.
          He throws bills on the bar.

<b>          BARMAN
</b>          No. This is on the house.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Why -

<b>          BARMAN
</b>          (odd compassion)
          It just is. Bitch.
          David looks across the club to see Sofia. A Clubgoer Guy
          whispers something in her ear. She shakes it off. He
          pounds down another shot at the bar, this time with the
          Barman.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Patron!
          David regards a video monitor behind the bar. Someone's
          camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another
          good-looking Young Man. She playfully shoves the good-
          looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David

          back another drink.

          Weaving at the urinal, David pees. Squeezes his temples to
          ward off a headache.

          The Clubgoers laugh. David laughs too. Suddenly, he feels
          better.

<b>          INT. CLUB         - NIGHT
</b>
          David moves through the crowd, powered by a new sense of
          belonging. The music swirls, and takes him along with it.
          He dances wildly. In the strobing darkness, he is
          anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one. David takes
          the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards. In
          profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions. David
          sees his moment. Sofia is alone near the corner of the
          club. He approaches her.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Hello again.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Hello again.

</b>          Idea. Let's start all over.
          He regards her for a moment, sees her apprehension and
          discomfort.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          How about if you help me? Unless
          I'm horning in here -

</b>          See, I've got a little problem.
          I've got a stalker.

          It doesn't sound life-threatening.
          (does himself, self-
          deprecating)
          I need a cover. I need for you to

          it's tough.

          I'll improvise.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (a touch playful)
          I don't talk like that.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          She's right across the room and

          right now, isn't she?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Red dress, strappy shoes?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          That's right!
          Their heads are close together, looking off into the club.
          David doesn't notice that Sofia is having a hard time
          playing along with this game. She is overwhelmed, holding
          it in. David continues.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I think she' s the saddest girl to
          ever hold a martini.

          David looks at her. His eyes flash at her choice of words.
          Perhaps there is hope. Sofia stares at. him, worried about
          his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn
          of a phrase. Push into close-ups as they struggle to deal
          with the discomfort of this moment.

</b>          I don't believe you just said
          that. That. is the best thing I've
          ever heard. That is hilarious.
          God, that just killed me. The way

          David, Brian and Sofia walk swiftly down the street in

          a wonderful evening.

          with me!

</b>          We'll call you.
          David and Brian walk on. Brian turns back to see Sofia
          running to the corner.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Well, it's been a real blast,
          David. I bid you good evening.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Where you going?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          My bike. It's back over there.
          We'll hang soon. Bring your mask
          if you want. I'm getting used to
          it.

</b>          (Brian's itching to go)

<b>          DAVID
</b>          What did you say to Julie Gianni

</b>          What?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You told her she was a "fuck

</b>          Never.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          And she was a little more than
          pissed about it.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          (a little guilty)
          Have you been harboring this shit
          all along? I never talked to her.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Whatever. I mean - who am I, if I
          can't. be the one who tells you
          you're not ugly? Aw, give me a

</b>          We're best friends! We're bros!
          Brian needs to rid himself of David. He turns and runs in
          the direction of Sofia.
          David feels the deep pangs of rejection. Breathing hard.
          His head hurts. His body hurts.

          David runs frantically, heartbroken and sobbing.

<b>          HIS MIND
</b>          Brian catches up to Sofia. She turns, relieved. They kiss
          messily, hungrily. Her shoes arch to reach his height.
          David runs the streets, nearing her home. The images are
          tearing his mind apart. He stops and leans against a car,
          unsteady and nauseous. Holding his head in pain, he
          manages to run further.
          David stops on the street outside her apartment. His sobs
          overwhelm him. He drops to the pavement. He passes out,
          mouth agape. The empty street visible in the b.g., his
          hand loosens its grip on the mask.

          He recoils. His vision sharpens. In the morning shadows,
          with increasing focus, we see that it is actually Sofia.

</b>          No, I'm okay -

</b>          Sofia examines him with a look of concern and
          understanding. Everything takes on a clear and sharp
          focus. Behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          And it worked. Get up.

          She stops in profile with him. She's astonished at his
          jealousy. Then:

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Apparently, you kept repeating it
          last night. You did sleep, David,

          can present the alternate
          argument. I once knew a guy who
          was a real loner. And one day he
          woke up at 40, with two daughters
          who lit his life up with purpose.
          Suddenly he goes to endless school
          plays, he gets home at       9:20                  for
          the evening discussion, and he has
          the time of his life. His

          love me... because if you don't,
          I'll just... have to kill you.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          In my next life I want to come
          back as this mole -

<b>          72

          her breasts)
          - seriously, this mole. I mean,
          you'll have to wear bikini tops to
          work, or loose-fitting shirts so I
          can breathe, but -

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I love you. I love you. I love
          you.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          - I could live right there.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Is this a dream?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Oh absolutely.
          She grabs his face, kisses him... a powerful moment, like
          few others in this life.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY
</b>
          Portrait of the couple together, moving down the middle of
          the street on fresh snow.

<b>          DAVID  (V.0.)
</b>          We talked about the big things,
          the little things, and the big
          things. But in truth, with Sofia,
          it was the in-between times.

<b>          INT. FLORENTINE'S BAR AND GRILL - DAY
</b>
          Sofia laughs. A perfect laugh. David admires her, sits
          next to her, holding her hand. Theirs is the unmistakable
          closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual
          relationship. They share a giddy open secret. Across the
          table, we reveal Brian. He's got a tiny high-tech camera.
          Sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to David in Spanish.
          David replies knowingly - "si"           - every few words. It's a
          deep communication. She exits.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          What, did she say?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (in love)
          I have no idea.
          Brian shakes his head.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          How's things, Brian?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Fine.
          David's face is huge in the Brian's viewfinder.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          How's things, Brian?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.
          Besides - Sofia is great, but by
          no means one-of--a-kind. She was a
          proximity infatuation.
          Brian, naturally suspicious and somewhat jealous,             spots  a
          writer at a nearby table making notes.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          (to writer)
          And don't use that, it's mine.
          The writer looks busted.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Where'd you get the camera?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I'm into things... you have no
          idea.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Well, as long as you're okay.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          And anyway, we're friends, aren't
          we?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Always.
          David offers his hand. They shake.

<b>          DAVID'S POV
</b>          David's gaze moves to a 40 year-old man staring at him with
          a bemused smile. A plate of food sits in front of him.
          His eyes suggest a piercing intellect, he looks at David
          with deep familiarity. David can't quite place the face.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Hey what's up with your face?
          Fuck, there's a seam opening or
          something!

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (mounting horror)
          What - what are you talking about?
          Brian laughs. The spell is broken. Friends again.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You asshole!

<b>          INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          David sleeps next to Sofia. He sits up, takes a glass of
          water from the night-stand, admires his girlfriend and
          moves to the bathroom.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          He turns on the light, fills the glass with water. Looks
          up into the restored mirror. His face is disfigured. He
          recoils in terror, knocking against a towel rack, sinking
          to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the
          lower cabinet.
          Sofia bolts upright. She sees him on the floor across the
          room, sees his face and backs up in the bed, leaning on her
          arm, screaming.

<b>          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          He awakens suddenly. Sofia is next to him, smiling.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          Was I snoring?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (still breathing heavily)
          No, I think it was me. Thirsty,
          that's all.
          She kisses his hand reassuringly.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I'm dreaming about you. Mmmmmmm.
          He gets up and goes to the bathroom.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM
</b>
          Tentatively, he flips the light on. A very relieved David
          regards his restored face. He shuts off the light quickly,
          and fills the glass of water. Splashes some water on his
          face.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM
</b>
          David climbs back into bed.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>
<b>          DAVID
</b>          (small laugh)
          I could listen to you say "mmmmm"
          for the rest of my life.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          They kiss. The kiss expands, as he moves to the back of
          her neck. He caresses her body. She kisses his
          fingertips. Her back to him. Tangled in sheets, they ease
          into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant
          for each other. He gently grabs a handful of her hair.
          His hand stops.   It's not Sofia's hair. He slowly turns
          her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of
          the woman who is not Sofia. He leaps out of bed, falling
          to the floor, the sheet tangled around him. He turns on
          the light.
          Julie Gianni hides her face from the light, like a night
          animal caught in the intrusive glare of day.
          When she speaks, it is with Sofia's cadence and accent.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          (scared, uncomprehending)
          Baby, what's wrong?
          He gasps for breath, backing away. Totally terrified.
          Paralyzed. In a low voice:

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Where. Is. She.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Who?
          His instinct is to protect his lifeline Sofia - and he
          pounces on her with a manic will to survive.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          76
</b>          Julie Gianni looks a little loopy, almost stoned.
          Taunting.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          (taunting, sweet)
          I'm Sofia.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
</b>
          David dismantles the phone, takes the cord. He ties her
          willing hands to the posts of the bed. She protests oddly,
          like an actress playing a part.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Now I'm going to make sure that I
          tie this four times. Do you know
          why, Julie? Because four times
          really means something.
          David pulls his pants on, frantically opens the wardrobe
          closet. No Sofia. Goes to the kitchen. No Sofia. Julie
          sobs quietly, sweetly, tied to the bed. She behaves and
          acts like Sofia.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          David, don't hurt me.
          David returns and sits across from her on the bed,
          terrified and barely hanging on.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Okay, I'm freaked out. It worked.
          So just tell me right now - where
          is Sofia?

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          I am Sofia.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          In one minute I'm going to call
          the police --

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          (heart breaking)
          Don't do it, honey.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I knew you'd survived the
          accident.
          She looks at him with tearful eyes.

</b>          What. accident?

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          I haven't had any accident!

<b>          DAVID
</b>          No, of course not. It wasn't an
          accident at all. It was attempted
          murder!

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          Honey, please.
          He picks up the phone. Dials 911.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Police Department? I've captured
          an intruder who's entered my home.
          He turns to her. Her eyes are yearning.

<b>          INT. POLICE STATION/INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          The flash of mug shots. We see David sitting, sweating,
          agitated waiting in a Police station holding room.
          Suddenly, the door opens and Thomas Tipp enters, flanked by
          other Detectives.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          Guys, can you give us a minute
          here? Detective Larson...
          Detective Andrews... thank you.
          The room empties, and Tipp approaches David.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          They think that I had something to
          so with this.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          I'm going to handle this exactly
          the way your father would have
          handled this. I've got it solved.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You've got it solved? Where is
          she?

<b>          TIPP
</b>          She's going to be fine.
          David hugs Tipp.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>
<b>          DAVID
</b>          Thank God you're here, man. I
          love her.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          Yeah... Now, I want you to look
          at these photos and then I'm going
          to destroy them. Sofia's
          testimony is also in here. It
          won't exist. She's not going to
          press charges.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Press charges against. me?

<b>          TIPP
</b>          David, wake up. As your friend, I
          think you should see what you did
          to Sofia. The press won't get
          hold of this if you get. away
          quickly.
          David leans back in his seat. It's all of them - everybody
          - against him. Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two
          computer discs and photos. He displays a photo to David,
          moving it into the light so he sees it clearly.              Julie
          Gianni, battered.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          This is Julie Gianni. That's not
          Sofia. This is Julie Gianni. I
          didn't do that do that to her.
          (beginning to shut down)
          Tommy, someone's setting me up.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          David, the Board and I have taken
          care of everything. They've been
          really great, actually. All of
          this is going to disappear. We're
          all behind you... even the Board.
          David looks at Tipp. It's very clear now. He's one of
          them. David attempts calm.

<b>          TIPP
</b>          (quiet, helpful)
          Get out of here.
          A migraine is thundering in David's head. His world is
          spinning backwards.

          David strides down the hallway. A Man in a crystal blue
          sport coat stands, waiting. As David passes, the Man
          confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable
          secret. Voices from other rooms, including a small child
          saying: "Mommy, mommy."

<b>          MAN IN BLUE COAT
</b>          This is a revolution of the mind.

<b>          INT./EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</b>
          Exiting, David is intercepted by a furious Brian.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          You're in fucking sad shape, man.
          Don't fucking ever hit a girl,
          man. Hit me, but don't fucking
          EVER hit a girl.
          David looks up -- sees a small security camera trained on
          them - pulls Brian out of the station.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Oh... it was Julie Gianni. So,
          Sofia was abducted by Julie, and
          now Julie is posing as Sofia.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Yes.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          You're in O.J. land, man. Julie

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I don't know what the cops have

          Julie Gianni is alive alive ALIVE.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I didn't talk to the cops. I
          talked to Sofia!

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Where is she?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          I just dropped Sofia off. And I

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Let me tell you something - I did
          not do that to her. Look me in
          the eye and tell me that it was
          the same girl you brought to the
          party. Tell me it was your dream
          girl, your "proximity
          infatuation."

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          (raw, finally)
          Yes! And you stole her from me!
          David backs away, as Brian responds bitterly, from his
          heart.

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          The one girl I really wanted, and
          you took her from me. You're
          insane. You're losing it, man.
          David nods powerfully. He now understands. Brian is one
          of them too.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You have revealed yourself.

</b>          Oh yeah, I'm with them.

</b>          Where'd you get the coat, Brian?
          Where'd you get the camera? How
          much did they pay you?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>          Listen to me, 'cause it's the last
          time we're ever gonna speak. I

          David nurses a drink, still breathing heavily. He's been
          crying. His head aches with this thought - maybe I am
          insane. A man in a classy suit walks towards him, inviting
          himself to sit at the table. His bedside manner is

</b>          David listens, as he looks at the spirited Saturday night
          crowd, lost in their revelry.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          -- and yet, they might only be here
          because you wanted them to be.
          You are their God. And not only
          that, you could make them obey
          you... or even destroy you.
          David shakes his head, exhausted and in no mood. He shuts
          his eyes, fights off a headache.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (cutting him off)
          What I'd like them to do is shut
          up! Especially you!
          Silence. David opens his eyes. They're all staring at
          him. Casually waiting for orders.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          You see?
          David looks at him with horror, backing away. Receding in
          his vision:

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          You and I signed a contract,
          David.

          McCabe is taut, following the thread. His voice calming.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Who is the man in the restaurant?
          Who is it?

</b>          Of course. Can you?

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Think about it. Think with your

<b>          RACING THOUGHTS
</b>          A woman walks down the hallway, looking back. Flash   of
          papers signed.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I signed something.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Was the man at the restaurant
          there?
          McCabe's voice becomes infinitely calm and helpful.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Fuck!

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Accept your body's resistance.

          Somebody died.

</b>          Do you understand that you hold

<b>          DAVID
</b>          It wasn't Sofia.

          David? You're about to tell me.
          Tell me what your heart and soul
          will not allow you to forget.
          David shudders. It's coming.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Did you kill Sofia?
          McCabe stands tall, stunned and curious, still pressing to
          pull the nightmare out of him.

<b>          INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK
</b>
          The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear
          the front door kicked in. David enters, slamming the door
          behind him. He looks around what was once the site of such
          happiness. The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now
          horrifying to him. He looks at a photo on the
          refrigerator. The same note: Call Dad! The exact
          expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier
          visit. Now it is Julie who is in her place.
          He opens her drawer. Just some papers. And then... the
          drawing he'd once done of her. Now featuring Julie. He
          rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment
          until he stops, collecting himself. Takes a breath and...
          Smash. A lamp is broken over his head. Julie Gianni bends
          down to help him. A shard of the lamp-base is still in her
          hand. Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl.
          Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around
          sweetness of Sofia.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          I thought you were a vandal.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (with difficulty)
          Who... are... you?

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          I'm Sofia.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          You are not Sofia... you're not
          Sofia...

</b>
<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          I'm Sofia.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Whatever.
          Julie starts to cry. Battling tears, she offers her heart
          and soul.

<b>          JULIANNA
</b>          David, honey. This will all be
          over soon. We'll be together
          again. You'll forget Julianna and
          I won't be afraid of you. Let me
          get you a cold towel.
          She exits. He struggles to rise. His head is a swirling
          mess. And then:

<b>          ON KITCHEN DOORWAY
</b>          Sofia slowly returns with towel. Her image still blurry.
          David advances, and faints into her arms.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Sofia?

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          (whispers)
          Yes, David, I'm Sofia. I'm Sofia.
          He accepts it, all of it, whatever it is, just to hold her.
          They kiss, gently, then more powerfully.

<b>          INT. SOFIA'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          They make love, emotionally and deeply. Two bodies
          yearning to possess the other. Camera moves across their
          bodies, as David wipes frame to black, as the move
          continues onto her back.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Where were you...
          Sofia doesn't answer, doesn't want to lose the moment.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I don't want to know.
          (thrusting)
          Just tell me you love me.
          David keeps his face buried in her shoulder'. He doesn't
          want to look. The passion gives way to a mounting dread,
          as he hears a voice almost like Sofia's.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>
<b>          JULIANNA (O.S.)
</b>          I love you. I'm afraid of how
          powerful this is.
          He continues moving passionately, harder now. Julie
          responds to the overwhelming surge within David. She gives
          over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a
          rocket. from hell. Harder now. Grabbing her hands and
          pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his
          own.
          Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion.
          This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking
          it. And then... slam... a pillow comes down over her face.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          What the fuck is happening?
          Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an
          advanced lovemaking session.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I want to see your face!
          She grabs at the pillow.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I want to see your face!
          David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control.
          Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence. He
          loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent
          attempt at life. Her hand smacks his neck. He's so taut
          it bounces off. She grabs at his face one last time, her
          hand is left with enough power only to caress his face.
          She goes limp. Silence. David's crying turns to a
          whimper. He looks at the pillow over Julie's head. He's
          confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline. He doesn't want
          to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath.
          He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest. With
          true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand
          will reveal who he's just killed.

<b>          ON HER TORSO
</b>          as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest. Quarter-
          inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top
          of her breasts... dreading the inevitable, not seeing it,
          and then... there it is. The mole between her breasts.

<b>          INT. HALLWAY STAIRS - DAY
</b>
          David exits hurriedly, past some tenants, down the stairs.
          He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror.

<b>

<b>

<b>

</b>          He looks horribly disfigured. We hear the sound of
          breathing, encased in a mask.

<b>          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT -  (INTERROGATION # 4)
</b>
          McCabe sits across from David. McCabe looks away, haunted
          by the admission of guilt.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I did it, didn't I? I don't...
          feel... like I killed someone. I
          feel like...

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          David, who...

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I'm in a dream...

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          . was the man at the restaurant?
          David shakes his head.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          (pained)
          Sometimes the mind behaves as if
          it were in a dream. Faces change,
          people become other people. The
          subconscious is a powerful thing.
          You treated Julie carelessly,
          didn't you, David? Your feeling
          of responsibility or guilt over
          Julie might have easily turned
          Sofia into Julie.
          (pause)
          Do you know what derangement is?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I need your help.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          All I know is, you killed your
          girlfriend and I don't know what's
          in your mind.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I need your help.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          I'd work on this case forever if I
          could, but we've run out of time.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          What will you plead?

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Temporary derangement. It's your
          best chance. They won't believe
          me.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          What do you believe?

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Believe it or not, I care about
          you. You've become like family to
          me. I don't want to give up on
          you.
          David looks at, him oddly. Suddenly, the archetype seems
          very familiar. McCabe continues with the noble concern of
          a towering father figure.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          (continued)
          But I needed more. I needed an
          answer. I... I even thought there
          was more than a good chance
          someone was playing tricks on you.
          Maybe it was the board. But I
          can't exceed my duties here. I'm
          just a psychologist, and I have to
          leave you.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Will I see you at the trial?

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          No. I'm just the opening act.
          He exits. David sits at. the table as McCabe and Aaron
          exit. He hears Aaron's television; it's the Life Extension
          Infomercial.

<b>          INT. AARON'S CUBICLE - NIGHT
</b>
          Through the glass of the psychiatric unit, we see McCabe
          and Aaron exit. Only Aaron's television, sitting on a
          stool, remains. Push in on the television, which is
          playing the L.E. Infomercial.
          Push in on the reverse. It's David at the window as he
          realizes the true meaning of "Ellie" -- L.E. He bangs on
          the glass, at first slow, then faster, yelling for McCabe.
          The L.E. Infomercial and Benny the Dog are reflected on the
          window.

          McCabe hustles down the hallway with David. McCabe stands
          tall, moving forward, like Atticus Finch with Tom Robinson.

<b>          INT. CAR
</b>
          McCabe watches David closely. Aaron the Guard turns to
          look at David behind the glass partition that separates
          them. David looks out the window at the world he's missed.

<b>          EXT. PLAZA - DAY
</b>
          The police vehicle pulls up in front of a crowded business
          plaza. McCabe exits with David. Always watching his every
          move, his every revelation. David looks upward at the
          towering skyscraper in the center of the plaza, rising high
          into the sky.

<b>          INT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY
</b>
          A Building Guard guides them through the lobby. McCabe
          trained on David. A look between the two. A Building
          Guard intercepts them.

          McCabe strides purposefully past the Building Guard. Aaron
          shows the pass, and hustles to keep up.

          handcuffs. The group moves together. Senses are
          overwhelming David, as they approach the reception station.

<b>          DAVID

          A stunning young woman rises and moves to greet them.

</b>          Good morning. I'm Libby. I'm

          Libby stares at David's masked face. It's slightly
          unsettling to her.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          He's my son. He's very shy.

          She-offers them two bound folders featuring the logo - L.E.
          - and guides them down the hallway, looking back with great
          style, beckoning, just as in David's dream recollections.

          Aames and McCabe sit and wait in a warm wood-paneled

          simple, life-affirming portraits of everyday life. It's
          well-appointed and well-marketed organization.
          McCabe regards David as the victim of a lunatic's scam.

          Life Extension, or L.E. as we like
          to refer to it, is a glimpse of
          the future... a ticket... not in
          the juvenile sense, but in the
          deeply meaningful sense that can
          only be borne in the human heart.

</b>          The DNA codes of the human body
          have been broken. Soon, heart
          ailments, cancer and so much more,
          will be a thing of the past. Very
          simply, your anguish... your
          discontent... even your death is
          no longer necessary in a
          traditional sense. Whatever
          malady that hides behind that
          mask... is temporary.
          She looks directly at David, and it stirs him. McCabe
          studies her, and the operation. He thirsts for clues.
          David flips through the folder - toward the back, a panel
          of photos of storage tanks. Lavishly and warmly
          photographed, just like next year's cars in a magazine.

</b>          Within an hour of your passing,
          L.E. will transfer your body to a
          vessel where you will be sealed
          and frozen at     196                   degrees below
          zero. Power outages, earthquakes,
          nothing will effect your
          suspension-hibernation.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          What's the "Lucid Dream" option?

<b>          DEARBORN
</b>          Good choice. The Lucid Dream is
          Life Extension's newest option.
          For a little extra, we offer the
          cryonic union of science and
          entertainment.

          "Cryo-tainment. "
          Dearborn spreads apart the paperwork on her desk to reveal
          a thin Video Monitor built into the glass table-top. Aames
          and McCabe peer into the table--top as Dearborn presses
          play.

<b>          ON MONITOR - THE PRESENTATION
</b>          An appealing presentation begins         -- Man's Life. A generic
          happy-looking Man with graphics floating out of his mouth:
          Re-Emerge ...     . Re-Store                 .Re--Invent...a voice takes over for
          Dearborn. A wonderfully comforting tone is present in the
          narration. Like that of a parent.

<b>          NARRATION
</b>          Portrait of a modern human life.

          Birth.
          (highlighting another
          stage)
          and Death. Imagine that you
          are suffering from a terminal
          illness. You'd like to be
          cryonized, but you'd rather be
          resurrected to continue your own
          life, as you know it now. L.E.
          offers you the answer. Upon
          resurrection you will continue in
          an ageless state - preserved - but
          living in the "present" with a
          future of your choosing.

<b>          VIDEO MONITOR -- THE PRESENTATION

          compartments. Music and atmosphere are seductive and
          compelling.

<b>          NARRATION (CONT ' D )
</b>          Your death will be wiped from your
          memory. Your life will continue
          as a realistic work of art,
          painted by you, minute-to-minute.
          And you'll live it with the
          romantic abandon of a summer
          day... with the feeling of a great
          movie, or a pop song you always
          loved. With no memory of how it
          all occurred, save for the
          knowledge that everything
          simply... improved. And in any
          instance of discontent, you'll be
          visited by Technical Support.

          pursuit of a dream? The dream of
          peace. The dream of achievement.
          The dream of hearing someone
          saying these words, when they
          truly mean them.
          David is deeply moved as he listens. Somewhere, music
          begins to play. It is The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations."

          That night, when Sofia left you

          life and the beginning of L.E.'s

          frozen and dreaming.

<b>          FADE UP ON MASK
</b>          A moody day dawns. David's mask is just outside the reach
          of his outstretched hand.

<b>          ON DAVID PASSED OUT ON STREET
</b>          Sofia's hand reaches in, and awakens him. Everything is

</b>          And on a day in late December, you
          gave yourself to us. You're now
          in a suspended state.

<b>          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT â€¢-- MEMORIAL - DAY
</b>
          Friends and family clog the old apartment. Shelby looks
          out into the hallway and sees an old acquaintance.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          Your friend Brian Shelby threw a
          three-day memorial in your old
          home. He was a true friend.

<b>          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
          Sofia ventures into David's apartment alone, taking in the
          environment and remembering the best moments of her brief
          encounter with David.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          You were missed, David.
          She moves into close-up, and we see the wonder and the joy
          of a perfect love, nearly attained. She soaks in the
          beautiful, painful mystery of life.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          It was Sofia who never fully
          recovered. It was she who somehow
          knew you best. And like you, she
          never forgot that one night where
          real, true love seemed possible.

<b>          FLASHBACK - DAY
</b>          David contemplates getting into the car with Julianna. He
          makes the choice that. will change this, and his next life.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          Consequences, David. It's the
          little things.

<b>          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- DAY

          Sofia exits the shot and we're left with an empty frame.

<b>          ON DAVID -- IN ELEVATOR
</b>          David turns from looking out the window of the elevator.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          (tears in eyes)
          The little things. There's
          nothing bigger, is there?

<b>          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>
          David and Ventura exit the elevator onto the rooftop.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          Your subconscious did create
          problems. Your dream turned into
          a nightmare. The glitch has been
          corrected.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          So all I have to do is imagine
          something? If I wanted McCabe to
          come back, right now -
          McCabe comes flying out of the door.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          David. Listen to me. These
          people are dangerous. We're in
          trouble. We need to get off this
          roof now.

<b>          MCC DAVID
</b>          Who turns from McCabe to Ventura.
          Ventura leads David away.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          We're now on "pause". And you're
          about to return to your Lucid
          Dream...

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          "Pause"?

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          (continuing)
          .. with all of the upgrades. You
          won't remember any of this, nor be
          charged for the technical support.
          it is now your moment of choice.
          You can return to your Lucid
          Dream, and live a beautiful life

</b>          with Sofia, or whomever you
          wish... or you can choose the
          world out there.
          Ventura gestures to the city beyond, as they come to a
          halt.

<b>          CLOSE ON DAVID
</b>
<b>          DAVID
</b>          The world out. there. And you can
          bring me back, just. like Benny the
          Dog.

<b>          CLOSE ON VENTURA
</b>          The client is starting to understand.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          Yes. Just like Benny the Dog.
          Your face and body can now be
          fixed, of course. But it's very
          different out there now. Your
          finances won't last long. Your
          panel of observers are waiting for
          you to choose.
          Ventura gestures into the camera. He begins walking
          backwards to the roof's ledge.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          There are no guarantees. But
          remember, even in the future, the
          sweet is never as sweet without
          the sour.
          David sees that Brian Shelby has now joined McCabe on the
          roof. He nods to Brian, who nods back.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          How do I wake up?

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          The decision is yours.
          Ventura glances over the edge.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          And I chose this scenario, didn't

<b>          I?

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          (enjoying that he
          understands)
          Yes, to face your last remaining
          fear of heights.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          David, don't listen to him. You
          were right. This is the Seven
          Dwarves. It's a set up! You
          can't trust him.
          David looks at McCabe with compassion.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          Don't feel bad, David. This
          winning man is your creation.
          It's in his nature to fight for
          his existence. But he's not real.

<b>          CLOSE ON DAVID
</b>          who looks on with compassion.
          McCabe fights for himself.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          I'm real. I have two daughters.
          You know that.

<b>          VENTURA

<b>          CLOSE ON DAVID
</b>          who feels for McCabe as the apparition crumbles.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          Mortality as home entertainment.
          This cannot be the future. Can
          it?
          David regards McCabe. Once dynamic, McCabe now seems
          unsure of his own existence. Slowly, always looking at
          David, he settles into the truth of his very being. With
          great nobility, McCabe shoves his hands into his pockets
          and faces his own destiny... or lack thereof.

<b>          MCCABE
</b>          (quietly)
          Goodbye.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          It's been a brilliant journey of
          self-awakening, and you've simply
          got to ask yourself -- what is
          happiness to you?

<b>          CLOSE PUSH IN ON DAVID AAMES
</b>          His moment of realization.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I want to live a real life. I
          don't want to dream any longer.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          Any last wishes?

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Let them out there read my mind.

<b>          VENTURA
</b>          I wish you well, David.
          Music rises as he turns to see Sofia. He moves to her.
          She touches his cheek. His face is restored. They
          embrace.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          Look at us. I'm frozen, and
          you're dead. And I love you.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          It's a problem.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I lost you when I got in that car.
          I'm sorry.
          She looks at him, beguiling and understanding.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          But remember what you told me
          once? Every passing minute is
          another chance to turn it all
          around.
          She kisses him.

<b>          SOFIA
</b>          I'll find you again.
          She regards her lost love, taking him in. David treasures
          his last moments with her.
<b>          
</b>
<b>          107
</b>          David takes a breath and begins backing to the ledge.

<b>          DAVID
</b>          I'll see you in another life when
          we are both cats.
          David backs up and begins to run. He arrives at the edge,
          looking down at the distance to the ground, stopping
          himself at the precipice.
          He looks back to Sofia one last time, and then leaps out
          into the celestial future. For a fraction of a moment, he
          is suspended in mid-air. And he hurtles to the ground.
          And the ground hurtles to meet him.

<b>          SERIES OF IMAGES
</b>          It is the little things, the random poetic instances of
          David Aames' life that come back to him. Music rises as he
          realizes, finally, his own true poetry and humanity. The
          images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his
          heartbeat. Father. Mother. A casual glance of a
          stranger. All combine to give his life meaning. And then,
          finally, we see the face of the one person who gave him
          purpose in this life... and the next. Sofia.
