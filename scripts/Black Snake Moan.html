               RAE is naked.

               Wrapped around her shoulders is a loose-knit spread that 
               conceals her slender form. She is in her 20's: a strawberry 
               blond, with cinnamon freckles spotted across her pale skin. 
               She is beautiful without trying.

               She stares at the distant trees. This is the South; the small 
               town of FISHERVILLE, TENNESSEE.

               Soon Rae will be alone.

               RONNIE is 25 years old. His hair is cropped in a military 
               issue buzz.

               Rae's face is wet with tears as Ronnie gently makes love to 
               her. She touches his face and sobs like a child.

</b>
               RONNIE is dressed in his National Guard fatigues, packing up 
               his gear.

               Rae is now wearing a short jeans skirt and a T-shirt with a 
               gray wolf print ironed on the front. There is a knock at the 
               door. Rae flinches. Ronnie opens the door revealing GILL 
               MORTON, Ronnie's buddy from high school.

</b>                         Yeah. Transmission's shot.

               Gill and Rae's eyes meet. Gill sees that Rae is crying.

</b>                         Gonna have a smoke.

               Ronnie shuts the door and feels a wave of sudden nausea. He 
               rushes past Rae.

               Ronnie is vomiting into the toilet as Rae rubs his head. 
               Each painful dry heave makes Rae comfort him more.

               Ronnie places his duffle bag in Gill's truck. Rae begins to 
               cough.

               Rae doesn't answer.

               Gill backs away, allowing Ronnie and Rae some privacy. The 
               two lovers stare into each others eyes and then embrace.

               Rae peeks over Ronnie's shoulder at Gill with an expression 
               of dread. Anger seizes her.

               Silence. Rae melts. Tears stream down her face.

               Ronnie removes a small digital watch and fastens it around 
               her wrist.

                         it comes up on you the hardest, right?

               Ronnie holds out his own wrist to show her his identical 
               watch.

<b>                                     RONNIE

                         each other at the same time. Wherever 
                         we are.

               Rae is shaking. He grips her by the back of her neck and 
               pushes their faces inches away. Eye to eye.

                         ain't gonna make it, Rae.

               Rae sees the fear in his eyes. She swallows her own anxiety 
               and nods.

<b>                                     RAE

               They kiss passionately.

</b>                         I love you.

               Afraid of his swelling emotion, Ronnie quickly breaks away 
               from her.

               Rae watches as her love leaves in Gill's pick-up. Compelled 
               to follow, she absently walks after the truck, down the gravel 
               drive.

               She stops. Silence. She is alone.

               An intense wave of sorrow hits, like a kick to her gut. She 
               gasps for breath as she struggles to hold back the flood of 
               her tears.

               Rae drops to her knees, right there in the gravel drive. Her 
               hair falls in front of her face, masking her grief.

               Her shoulders shudder.

               Her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly -- 
               a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning 
               sensation that consumes her.

               Tears come to her. She's not going to be able to stop it.

               Rae is gripping the watch around her wrist for comfort. Her 
               breathing is already out of her control. The dizziness is 
               already upon her. The familiar burning.

               She inhales in gasps, rocking back and forth on her knees. 
               The late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy.

                         Mm-mm... Mm-mm...

               The scratching at her leg leaves a red mark. She is dizzy 
               with anxiety. Her teeth are clenched, her face is flush.

               TEHRONNE is fucking Rae from behind.

               Tehronne is a muscular, dark-skinned, black male in his late 
               twenties.

               Rae's face is crammed up against the mirror in the small 
               bathroom. Tehronne gets faster and pushes harder -- a stark 
               contrast to her lovemaking with Ronnie.

               Rae comes. A severe coughing fit hits her. She pushes him 
               away with her ass.

               Walking with his hands shoved deep into his pockets, wearing 
               his only suit and tie, is LAZARUS WOODS (LAZ). He is in his 
               late fifties, black, a strong face under his old fedora. He 
               stares across the street into Dunn's Cafe.

               ROSE WOODS, black, early forties, stands in the cafe. She 
               looks confident and resolute in her new green skirt.

               A brown Delta Olds pulls up into a parking space in front of 
               Laz. Stepping out is REVEREND R.L., Laz's longtime friend. 
               He is also black and in his late fifties.

                         we are lost.

               Laz crosses to Rose's booth -- the distance seems to stretch 
               out into eternity.

               Lazarus steers his tractor toward his small home in a sea of

               is the head of a rose garden with a painted sign under it:

               Laz inhales smoke and exhales hate. The tractor lunges 
               forward, trampling the garden, ripping the flowers to shreds.

               MAYELLA is a heavy, forty-year-old black woman. Her blue 
               neon tube top matches her short pants stretched across her 
               healthy ass. She is flipping through the juke box selection.

               BOJO is reading a paper behind the bar. He's short and stout, 
               looking like a sad bull dog.

               Mayella lifts up her leg and stretches it over the bar with 
               a provocative flourish. Her shoe is bright blue.

               Laz pushes Deke back through the joint and slams him onto 
               the pool table. He grips Deke's throat and holds the broken 
               bottle up to his face.

               it. Laz lifts his hand. His own blood leaks from between his 
               fingers.

               He wipes the blood across Deke's face.

               Laz kills the rest of his whiskey. He squeezes his eyes closed 
               as the liquor burns his throat. He tosses the bottle into a 
               trash bag he is holding.

               Laz continues throwing out all of Rose's make-up and hair 
               products. With one broad sweep, he cleans off her vanity.

               Laz opens the front door and tosses the two bags outside.

               the woods. She is in her shirt and panties, wearing football 
               shoulder pads.

               She is completely wasted. Lost. The ground rocks back and 
               forth with each step. Trees pass in a slow-motion haze.

               Rae grips a tree to steady herself, but a team member tackles 
               her. The woods spin and distort as someone mounts her with 
               ease.

               Rae smiles as she lifts her hand up to the stars, passing 
               the writhing back of the guy on top of her. If she could 
               just grab a star she would feel safe again.

               She tries to snatch one. She can't. Her hand drops as the 
               boy stands and takes off after his friends tossing the 
               football.

               Rae lies motionless on the ground.

               Blood is on her face.

               A hasty idea. He pushes her out of the truck. She falls to 
               the dark pavement in a tangle of her own limbs.

               The door slams. Gill floors the gas. Rae lies motionless 
               alone under the stars.

               Laz tosses the bags inside his trash cans.

               He's really hung over this morning. His eyes squeeze shut, 
               he grips his neck in pain.

               His eyes open. They remain fixed beyond us. The pain in his

               Rae lies on the side of the road.

               Her T-shirt and panties are damp from the early morning mist, 
               her face caked with dried blood. Her skin is deathly white, 
               her mouth open, her eyes shut and swollen.

               Lazarus carefully steps toward her. He leans down over her 
               face.

               carrying Rae, unconscious and limp, in his arms.

               He lays her down on the couch by the radiator. He pulls a 
               quilt over her cold skin. With a twist of the valve the 
               radiator moans to life.

               Laz takes out his bandana and cleans her face. He tries to 
               wake her.

               A labored breath followed by the most pitiful cough fit. Laz 
               tries to calm her as her lungs fight for oxygen. Laz looks 
               scared as the coughing stops in a desperate wheeze followed 
               by silence.

               Laz pulls the phone off its cradle on the wall and flips

               His fingers scan down the listings and stops on POLICE

               As soon as he places the phone to his ear, he looks over at 
               Rae sprawled out on his couch. Her bare legs can be seen 
               peeking out from under the quilt.

               Fear hits him. He slams the phone down again.

               Laz crosses to the couch and gently touches her head.

               Snot and spittle has run down the side of Rae's face -- her 
               eyelids stick together as she tries to open them.

               There is a creak, followed by another. Rae has become aware 
               that someone is slowly walking up the front porch.

               The door opens. Silhouetted in the day's blinding light is a 
               white man in his 40's. His face is indistinguishable to Rae's 
               affected gaze.

               Is this a dream?

               He stands above her and lights a cigarette. The Zippo lighter 
               clasps shut. The man lowers it to his side where Rae can see 
               it clearly. A bald eagle is printed on the side, a sight 
               that makes Rae's eyes open wide in horror.

               Her breath grows deeper -- a girlish plea. This is no dream -- 
               it's a nightmare.

               A massive hand slaps down over her mouth. Her crusted eyes 
               peer above the hairy knuckles. He sucks on the cigarette. A 
               red cherry blazes at the end. The man pushes the blanket off 
               of her and grips her panties.

               Rae's eyes close. She knows what is next. In his clenched 
               fist, the panties are ripped off.

               Rae flinches awake from the fever-induced nightmare and falls 
               to the wooden floor, drenched in sweat. Weakened and shaking, 
               she scampers away, finally collapsing in the kitchen. Her 
               hand reaches out and lands on the strings of Laz's guitar on 
               the floor. She grips the steel strings with her trembling 
               fingers.

               A single bass note twangs as she passes out.

               Laz enters the empty pool hall. Tehronne is playing a game 
               with a skinny playa-wanna-be dressed in flea-market Fubu.

               CHARLIE, the owner, approaches Laz from the bar.

               Charlie nods Laz on. He crosses to the back pool table as 
               Tehronne sinks the 8. Tehronne looks at his friend.

               Rae's eyes are open and filled with fear. She struggles to 
               flee as Laz holds her in place, trying to reassure her.

               Rae is too weak to talk or move. Laz clutches her small face 
               in his dark hands.

               Lazarus looks terrified as she cranes her head back and 
               forward. Her mouth opens.

               In her sickened state, with the force of something evil and 
               deep inside, Rae clasps her open mouth over Laz's. A shriek 
               sounds in his brain as he holds her tighter, allowing the 
               kiss to grow in intensity. Rae falls to her stomach as Laz 
               abruptly stands and stumbles across the room. What he sees 
               chills him to the bone.

               Rae is writhing on the floor as if she is possessed -- a 
               rant of raspy words pour from her mouth.

               Lazarus gets spooked by what he is seeing. He looks to the 
               mantle. His weathered Bible lies in a coat of dust. He picks 
               it up as a wave of the burning hits Rae.

               door.

               Silence. Laz reaches down and picks up his Bible.

               A passage catches his eye. As he reads, the fear vanishes 
               from his face. His back straightens. His jaw tightens. He 
               looks back at his house, his faith is renewed.

               Rae is motionless. Exhausted. Her eyes are open but blind. 
               Her lip trembles. Her body shakes from the freezing water.

               Laz rubs the hair from her face gently. He reaches over to 
               the Bible on the toilet and opens it to read.

                         him.

               Rae's shivering is abating. Her eyes fight to stay open. Laz 
               touches her forehead to test her temperature.

               The faint echo of Rae's fevered panting.

               She lies on the couch wrapped in a quilt, shivering. Her 
               eyes remain closed, her face drenched with sweat. Laz has 
               cleaned her facial wounds, using a few Band-Aids.

               An explosion ignites the windows surrounding the cabin. Rae 
               jolts awake, terror pervades her as she gasps at the fire 
               ball outside the window.

               She struggles to her feet and listens. A faint sound can be 
               heard through the roar of the flames. beep beep... beep

               Rae stumbles to the door, weak and dizzy. She grips the door 
               knob and pulls the door open.

               Rae races outside, tripping down the front porch steps. She 
               looks off at the blaze in the squash field. She frantically 
               races toward the fire, the beeping increases.

               At the center of the blaze is an upside down Humvee. To the 
               left of the vehicle, a few soldier's bodies lay scattered. 
               Rae's legs lose all strength, she collapses and crawls across 
               the squash plants.

               A far away voice is heard over the roaring flames.

               Rae crawls across a fallen soldier, following the sound of 
               Ronnie's alarm. She struggles to breathe, she almost faints.

               She finds a soldier face down. With all her strength she 
               turns him over. It is Ronnie, wide-eyed and lifeless.

               An awful groan comes out of Rae -- crippling sorrow. She 
               pulls on his vest trying to wake him.

               Rae looks up. The flaming humvee is gone. She is not pulling 
               on Ronnie's vest, but the tangled vines of a squash plant.

               Laz stands at a safe distance, silhouetted in moonlight.

                         Now... come on inside with me.

               Rae looks like a terrified child. Her eyes well with tears 
               as she shakes her head. Laz takes a step toward her.

               She turns and runs away as best she can. Laz chases after 
               her. He's much older than her and a bit slower, but her 
               balance betrays her.

               Laz wraps his arms around her. Rae screams to the sky.

               And then, stillness. Rae lies limp in Laz's arms, unconscious.

               He reaches down and lifts her wrist to his face. The green 
               screen of the digital watch pulsates with the alarm.

               He pushes the side button. The beeping stops. Silence.

               Laz lays Rae back onto his couch. Her eyes open into slits.

               Rae grabs Laz's wrist. He flinches with her force.

               Struggling with exhaustion, Rae moves Laz's hand to her bare 
               stomach. She rubs it slowly up and down her form, 
               suggestively.

               Laz slips his hand away and claps it tight over her eyes. 
               Rae holds her breath, waiting to be molested, her lip 
               quivering.

               Rae relaxes and falls into a deep sleep.

               Laz backs away from her, a touch of fear in his heart. The 
               voice of Tehronne is heard from earlier in the day.

               Laz enters his home. He crosses to the kitchen and pours 
               himself a glass of water.

               Dripping with sweat, he steps back into the room, downing 
               the last of his water. He lowers the glass, noticing Rae 
               looking at him.

               Rae lifts her head off the pillow. Laz comes to her side and 
               helps her sit up.

                         that medicine in ya.

               Rae sits up on the couch, the quilt wrapped around her waist. 
               She looks at the cough syrup bottle on the side table.

               Rae lifts her head, revealing tears in her eyes. She gets 
               mad at herself and wipes them away.

               Rae struggles for balance as she attempts to stand. The quilt 
               falls away as a heavy chain slides off the couch and thuds 
               on the floor by her feet.

               Rae feels a tug.

               She looks down to see a dark chain locked around her thin 
               waist and coiled on the floor. The opposite end is locked 
               around the side coil of the radiator.

               She is chained to the house, a prisoner.

               as dust flies of the radiator with each tug.

               Laz crosses to the radiator and pats it like a proud parent -- 
               his wedding ring clicks against the iron.

               Rae is screaming and grunting as Laz, standing in his kitchen, 
               tugs on the chain around the door-jam like he's drawing water 
               from a well.

               Outside Rae struggles to hold onto the porch post. Laz pulls 
               hard, lifting her lower torso off the ground.

               Laz yanks. Rae loses her grip and slams onto the porch.

</b>
               The pulling stops. Rae picks herself up. Her knees and hands 
               are scraped and bleeding. The two stare at each other.

</b>                         Say we talk. Just take a seat on the 
                         sofa. I'll get us somethin' cool to 
                         drink.

               Laz crosses to the kitchen. Rae sits down on the couch, 
               noticing the fallen lamp on the floor.

</b>                         You may not remember. But you spent 
                         a whole half day in my tub, tryin' 
                         to cool down. Melted four ice trays.

               He finishes preparing the two waters. He crosses into the 
               front room. Rae is not there.

               CRASH! Rae smashes the lamp on Laz's head. The water glasses 
               shatter as Laz falls to the floor.

               Rae picks up a wooden chair and breaks it over his back. 
               Before she can do any more damage, Laz grabs her by the wrists 
               and throws her to the couch.

               Rae falls to the floor. Laz stumbles on his feet as he 
               clutches his bleeding head. He loses his cool.

                         keep me locked up like this!

               Rae freezes as she sees Laz undo his belt buckle. Her breath 
               starts to quiver as she deeply inhales and exhales.

                         that...

               Laz whips his belt off and wraps the buckle around his fist.

               He stops in his tracks. Rae is panting and shaking. Her middle 
               finger is scratching at her own thigh.

                              away)
                         Now take that look out'cha eye.

               Her anguished hum can be heard through her clenched teeth as 
               she rocks back and forth. Her hands wander down to her inner 
               thighs.

               Rae gets dizzy. She rests the top of her head on the floor 
               and sways back and forth. Laz rushes out the front door.

               As the wave hits, Rae twists and turns, wrapping the chain 
               around her. She grips the radiator with both hands and rests 
               her face against the side.

               The wave is about to build in to a powerful climax. Rae gasps 
               for breath.

               The door slams open. Laz drenches her with a gallon of cold 
               well water from a tin bucket. Rae inhales and freezes. Laz 
               waits and watches.

               The burning is gone.

               Laz kneels next to her and gently frees her bare ankle from 
               the tangled chain.

               They are both seated on the front porch with paper plates in 
               their laps. Laz watches with amusement as Rae tears into her 
               chicken and gobbles up the vegetables.

                         and see how they taste.

               Rae remains under Lazarus' intense gaze as the cicadas sing.

               Rae stares off at orange clouds and purple sky. She takes a 
               step to her left, walking through the parallel rows of squash.

               The chain gently rattles behind her. Laz has given her about 
               20 feet of slack. He holds the chain tight around his fist.

               Rae grins, standing proud in her wolf shirt and panties.

               Rae teases Laz by adjusting her panties. She turns back to 
               the sunset and stretches.

               Rae's smoldering eyes don't leave Laz as he chains her to 
               the radiator. Laz nervously preaches, trying to avoid the 
               sight of her bare legs curled up on his couch.

               Laz moves in close and starts applying antibacterial cream 
               to the cut above Rae's eye.

               Rae is aware that Laz is somewhere else, talking to someone

               He pours Rae a glass of water and returns to her side.

               deep, the burning is coming on.

               She folds her arms over her chest, her middle finger 
               scratching her elbow. The anxiety is too much. She rolls 
               over until the chain pulls taut against the radiator.

               Rae has wrapped herself in a tangle of chain. Her breathing 
               relaxes. Her eyes close. She sleeps.

               Laz pulls his truck next to two other fruit and vegetable 
               vendors: ARCHIE and GENE.

               Archie is an old black man in his early seventies. Gene is a 
               short white man closer to Laz's age.

               reads a note on top of the plate: BE BACK FOR SUPPER.

               She pulls off the top plate and finds sausage links, eggs,

               Rae sits down in the tub, still wearing her T-shirt and 
               panties. Looking up at the shower head above she turns on 
               the cold water and yanks up on the shower knob.

               Cold water sprays down over her. She gasps and then relaxes, 
               laying back in the tub.

</b>                         Mister Laz, I'm comin' inside...

               Lincoln can't believe what he sees. Rae is chained around 
               the waist, damp and barely clothed. Her eyes bore into Lincoln 
               like an owl zeroing in on a helpless jackrabbit.

               She rips her shirt off in one tug over her head.

               Lincoln can't move. The picnic basket hits the floor. His 
               mouth hangs open in shock as Rae steps towards him and lays 
               her open mouth on the boy.

               SLAM! Rae shuts the door.

               Laz steers his Ford truck up the drive and parks. He takes 
               his time getting out and removing the shopping bags. He opens 
               the door and goes inside.

               His curses can be heard from outside.

               Lincoln is tossed off the porch, clinging to his overalls.

               Tears and fear come to Lincoln as Laz steps out onto the 
               porch, fuming with rage.

               Lincoln backs away expecting a good beating. He starts running 
               up the drive but stops as R.L.'s Olds rolls up the drive.

</b>                         Lincoln, come on back.

               Lincoln darts past Laz and runs into the barn, clutching his 
               overalls. R.L. stops the car halfway down the drive and steps 
               out.

               R.L. stops in his tracks as Lazarus pulls out his hunting 
               rifle from the rack behind his seat in his truck.

                         Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.

               Ronnie sits next to Gill. Herman leans in wanting to be a 
               part of the conversation.

               back.

               Ronnie glares at Herman as he moves to the other side of the 
               bar. Gill moves closer to Ronnie to get the whole story.

               Gill's truck rounds the bend and up the gravel drive leading 
               up to Ronnie's trailer.

               The headlights scan across the porch as Gill parks.

               Ronnie is the first through the door, calling out for Rae 
               before he can turn on the lights.

               Gill enters. He sees that the trailer is the same as it was 
               the day he picked up Ronnie, nothing is different.

                              (tears)
                         ...and run.

               Gill is disturbed by Ronnie's sudden flood of emotion and 
               tears. He crosses to the pantry, already knowing which 
               cupboard to pull the liquor out of.

               He pours two drinks. He hands one to Ronnie.

               Gill turns away. Ronnie grips Gill around the neck from

               talk about football.

               They pull away, up the drive, and disappear into the night.

               The cicadas sing as the two stand in silence: Rae, at peace,

               pain.

               A bottle of whiskey is removed from a top cabinet above the

               Laz pulls Rae closer to him by the chain wrapped around her 
               waist. He opens the old lock with a key.

               sitting at the table.

               Laz slides his calloused fingers across the strings, spurring 
               the old guitar into an impressive wail. Rae grips the chair.

                         heart.

               A haunting slide guitar riff barks. Rae has a physical 
               reaction to the music. She is fascinated and fearful.

                         seen it with women before. I knew.

               Laz thinks for a moment. Continues playing.

                         want me to come... so I stayed put.

                         took it away. Cut it out.

               The guitar's song turns dark. Laz slides his fingers up the 
               guitar strings, lingering on low growns.

                         know. But I am a haunted man.

               Fear spreads across Rae's face. Laz is talking about something 
               all too familiar.

               Laz stops. He sways back and forth with his eyes closed. Rae 
               hears the swell of the cicadas. Her eyes dart to the front 
               door as the familiar creek of footsteps are heard.

               The door swings open. A white calloused hand appears around 
               Rae's mouth.

               She gasps in terror, clutching Laz's leg. The white hand is 
               gone. Tears come to her. She trembles as Laz sings.

               Laz. Tears have run down his dried face. He opens his eyes.

               Rae kisses Laz. He is motionless at first, allowing it to 
               happen. His hand moves from the neck of his guitar to the 
               bend in her neck.

               The passion intensifies as they squeeze the guitar between 
               them.

               Laz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his hands. 
               They are so close, they are breathing into each other's

               The guitar clangs to the floor as Laz lifts Rae in his arms. 
               They kiss, ravenous for each other. He knocks up against the 
               side table, causing his Bible to fall to the floor, face up 
               and open. The wind pushes the front door open, slamming it 
               hard against the wall.

               They turn together, kissing, Laz slowly spinning with Rae in 
               his arms. But Laz is soon distracted by the pages of his 
               Bible fluttering on the floor. The wind is blowing the pages,

               It takes a considerable effort to pull Rae away. She falls 
               to the floor, dizzy and sucking in air.

               Rae is struggling for breath. She desperately grabs at Laz.

                         I don't think I can stop this.

               Her eyes roll back briefly, almost losing consciousness. Laz 
               catches her and holds her tightly.

               Laz grips the chain and wraps it around Rae.

               As the burning increases. Laz holds Rae tight across his 
               lap, his back up against the radiator.

               Rae turns away as Laz holds her head in his lap. She bites 
               down on his middle finger as his hand moves over her mouth.

               She is gasping, screaming into his hand.

               It hits. Laz holds her.

               Rae's open mouth quivers as the sensation peaks. Her shoulders 
               slump, her chest vibrates. She is crying softly.

               mirror. She looks at the compact in her hand and decides 
               against the purchase.

               She rounds the corner and stops. She sees Sandy on her knees 
               in the center of the aisle, building a display of tuna cans.

               Rae thinks to leave, but stops. She makes a decision to talk 
               to her. She walks up the aisle and stands above her mother.

               Angela blushes. She looks around and then leans in close to 
               Laz. She sings softly, sweetly, with all her soul.

               see the people running to the front of the grocery store.

               Laz is grinning from ear to ear. He is about to speak but 
               the commotion outside the grocery catches his attention. His 
               smile fades.

               Laz rushes past the gawking customers at the end of the aisle. 
               A few male workers, including Mark, stand at a distance 
               watching Rae weep on the floor.

               Sandy is being helped up by a co-worker -- her head is 
               bleeding.

               Rae rocks back and forth, her face spotted with flour dust, 
               the mop held tightly in her grip.

               Mark tries to step closer but Rae cries out, thrashing with 
               the mop handle. They retreat.

               He lifts her up in his arms. She sobs into his chest as he 
               carries her through the onlookers.

               Angela is there. She looks confused and shocked.

               Ronnie has parked Gill's truck on the square. He starts 
               walking up to the grocery store.

               He sees Laz carrying Rae in his arms. She is sobbing into 
               his chest, blind to all around her. Ronnie freezes in shock 
               as Laz approaches.

               Laz pushes Ronnie causing him to fall backwards on to the 
               pavement.

               Ronnie watches Laz put Rae in his truck and drive away. A 
               wave of nausea hits. He turns over and heaves.

               Rae is holding her knees to her chest in the tub. Laz sits 
               next to her, dipping the sponge in the water, gently washing 
               her back and shoulders.

               Laz moves her head back into the palm of his hand to wash 
               her hair. She stares into his eyes as he squeezes the sponge

               Rae is wrapped in the quilt, laying on the couch. She is 
               awake and motionless, helpless to her depression.

               Laz sits on the side of his bed. Something is on his mind.

               We CUT TO him on his stomach searching for something under 
               his bed.

               Another old guitar case comes out, followed by another, then 
               another. Finally, Laz stands, an old maroon case in his grip.

               He opens the latches on the side and lifts the thin lid, 
               revealing a gorgeous cream colored electric guitar.

               Laz's truck groans as it bounces into the crowded parking

               Rae steps out, looking beautiful in her sun dress. Laz slams 
               the door to his truck, guitar case in hand.

               They begin walking inside. Rae's watch goes off. She quickly 
               turns it off. But a faint echo of the alarm can be heard 
               behind her. She stops and turns toward the truck. The sound

               Laz and Rae stand like strangers by the door. The place is

               a flask. He offers it to Laz. Laz snaps it away.

               Laz surprises R.L. by walking away and up onto the stage.

               Rae watches as Laz, shakes hands with some of the band 
               members. A few whistles from the crowd.

               Laz sits down at a chair off to the right of a short mic 
               stand.

               He plugs in.

               Rae watches curiously as Laz tunes his guitar -- moans of 
               electric distortion.

               R.L. sits next to her.

               The drummer kicks in. Laz tears into the strings. The entire 
               place begins to undulate and bounce as Laz returns to the 
               blues.

               Cheers. Rae watches in awe. She's never seen anything like 
               it. She is surrounded by couples dancing so close they might 
               as well be naked. But there is also a great sense of safety 
               as Laz controls the room with his music.

               Rae looks up at Laz. Laz smiles and nods. Rae takes the man's 
               hand and moves out onto the dance floor. R.L. can't be seated 
               anymore. He stands and stomps his foot.

               Rae allows Laz's voice and guitar to take hold of her. Her 
               face gets wet with sweat as she moves, making love to the 
               current in the air.

               Men are dancing all around her, but now she is in control. 
               She turns to a young man and shakes, then an old man.

               She is free, herself, and above all, safe.

               Laz smiles, unaware of Ronnie watching from the window behind 
               him. There is rage and confusion in his face as he watches 
               Rae surrounded by dancing limbs.

</b>
               Laz is taking off his shoes, getting ready to crash for the 
               night. He sits down on the side of his bed and takes off his 
               shirt, leaving his T-shirt on.

               Rae is standing in his doorway.

               Rae understands. She crosses to Laz and kisses him on the 
               cheek.

               Rae then walks down the hall to her couch in the front room.

               Laz turns off the light.

               Rae enters the dark bathroom and shuts the door behind her. 
               Her hair is shorter, a shaggy bob, bleached platinum blond.

               ARTY, always behind the door, attempts to enter, but Rae 
               pushes the door closed and locks it.

               Rae finds the light switch. She yelps upon seeing Ronnie 
               crouched by the tub.

               Suddenly feeling violated Rae yanks down on her shirt to 
               hide the fact that she's not wearing anything else.

               Ronnie attempts to get up but it's too late, Rae has already 
               squatted on the commode, pinning Ronnie between her and the 
               bathtub.

               Rae is breathing heavy, her focus is scattered. She's coming 
               up or coming down from a big burn.

               Ronnie tries to look away, trying to make an awkward moment 
               less awkward. Rae's anxiety is hitting her.

               Ronnie nervously considers this before agreeing to open his

               Ronnie leans over and dry heaves into the tub. It is painful. 
               Rae leans forward and touches his back, comforting him.

               gently rubs his wet face and sings her words of comfort.

               Ronnie begins to calm down. The sobbing abates.

               The metal music from the party outside is muffled through 
               the door. The two hold onto each other in silence.

               Rae pees. They both giggle, a welcome release of tension.

               Ronnie lifts his head from sleep - his memory of Rae has 
               vanished.

               He is leaning against the corner of the barn, his .45 in his 
               grip. His gaze slowly turns toward Laz's darkened house.

               His hand begins to shake.

               with the guitar playing. He could stay there for hours 
               watching this little girl play his guitar.

               Rae looks up and sees Laz. She stops playing.

               Laz spins around knocking away Ronnie's arm. BAM! The gun 
               fires into the wall. The guitar cracks on the floor.

               and slams him to the floor, pushing his gun into Laz's face.

               The last shout from Laz completely destroys Ronnie. His

               Laz snatches the gun from his hand and stands.

                         took that feeling away was... was... 
                         when I met Ronnie.
                              (the emotion really 
                              hits hard)
                         Cuz I love him so much. He's all I 
                         got in my life that's special. And I 
                         like taking care of him and helping 
                         him when he gets nervous. When I can 
                         do that for him... it's like I'm 
                         givin' somethin' of myself that I 
                         haven't givin' nobody else.

               wipes away a tear.

               Laz enters the pool hall and spots Tehronne. Tehronne motions 
               him back. Next to Tehronne is an old black man named PINETOP.

               Pinetop grins and produces a black velvet cloth. He opens it 
               gently and spreads it out, revealing a long, thin, gold chain.

               They both round the corner, revealing an old Chevy Caprice. 
               It is light brown except for one door that is gray, however

                         reasoned like a child.

<b>               EXT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - LATE DAY
</b>
               Ronnie turns toward the trailer. He is in his suit, standing 
               in his front yard -- Lincoln at his side. R.L. stands to the 
               side with a Bible in his hands.

                         ways behind me.

               Ronnie is amazed with what he sees. Laz leads beautiful Rae 
               down the steps as Angela tends to her side.

<b>                                     R.L. (V.O.)
</b>                         Now we see but a poor reflection as 
                         in the mirror; then we shall see 
                         face to face. I know in part; then I 
                         shall know fully, even as I am fully 
                         known.

               Rae holds firm to Laz's arm as they come together on the 
               green grass to witness and perform this union.

<b>                                     R.L. (V.O.)
</b>                         And now these three remain: faith, 
                         hope and love. But the greatest of 
                         these is love.
                              (Looks to Laz)
                         Who gives this girl in marriage?

<b>                                     LAZARUS
</b>                         I do.

               Lazarus takes a few steps with Rae, offering her arm to 
               Ronnie. Ronnie and Laz stay locked in each other's gaze.

               Laz stands next to Angela as Ronnie and Rae face R.L. 
               together.

                         each other and listen to me carefully. 
                         Do you understand?

<b>                                     RAE & RONNIE
</b>                         Yes. Yes, sir.

               They both obey -- each with a serious expression.

<b>                                     R.L.
</b>                         I require and charge you both as you 
                         stand in the presence of God to 
                         remember that love and loyalty alone 
                         will avail as a foundation of a happy 
                         and enduring home.
                              (to Lincoln)
                         Go on, hand it to him.

               Lincoln steps toward Ronnie and holds up the black velvet. 
               Ronnie takes the gold chain and carefully wraps it around 
               Rae's waist.

                         assume.

               Laz looks on -- a conflicted emotion of joy and loss.

<b>                                     R.L.
</b>                         If these solemn vows be kept 
                         inviolate, the home which you are 
                         establishing will abide in peace and 
                         your life will be filled with joy.

               Angela reaches over and takes Laz's hand in hers.

<b>               EXT. FREEWAY / INT. RONNIE & RAE'S NEW CAR - DAY
</b>
               Ronnie is at the wheel of the Chevy Caprice. Rae sits silently 
               next to him.

               Rae looks out the window as a huge 18 wheeler rolls up on 
               her side. She tries to ignore it and the tension it brings.

               She turns to see that Ronnie is sweating. Another truck is 
               on his side sandwiching them in. An attack is coming over 
               Ronnie.

               His breath is short. His chest tightens. Rae reaches over 
               and gently strokes the back of his neck.

</b>                         I gotta pull over.

               He breaks. The two trucks zoom ahead as Ronnie breaks to the 
               side. Dust flies as the Chevy skids to a stop on the side of 
               the road.

               Trucks zip by shaking the car, as Ronnie tries to get control 
               of his breathing.

               Rae tries to stay calm, stroking the back of his neck as he 
               struggles for breath. He puts his forehead against the wheel 
               to stave off the building nausea.

<b>                         FUCK!
</b>
               Fear comes to Rae's face as she notices her middle finger 
               scratching at the back of Ronnie's neck. She pulls it away 
               and shoves her hand between her thighs.

               Her eyes close as the burning builds. She grips the gold 
               chain around her waist.

               The chain, tight around Rae as she struggles. Rae panting 
               and sweating on Laz's floor. She reaches out. Her hand lands 
               on the strings of his guitar. A single string is plucked.

<b>                                                             FLASH BACK TO:

               Rae opens her eyes -- the low note still sounding in her 
               head. She places her hand back on his neck. And then, soft 
               as a prayer:

<b>                                     RAE

                         You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. 
                         You make me happy, when times are 
                         gray.

               Ronnie slowly turns and looks at Rae, his head still resting 
               on the steering wheel. The panting has slowed. Color starts 
               returning to his cheeks.

                         You'll never know dear, how much I 
                         love you. 
                         Please don't take, my sunshine away.

               The anxiety is gone. Ronnie takes a breath and looks at Rae, 
               humbled and thankful of her power to soothe him.

               Rae is smiling.
