          The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal
          container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it.
          Hertz gives it to Rick.

          He gives the finger to the EES photographer, who obligingly
          takes a picture. Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls
          after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.

          Rick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table,
          across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a
          placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an
          aide, who scurries off.

          Rick nods. We cut back to George, but he isn't George
          anymore. He has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the
          same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.

          Rick furrows his brow. He's a little suspicious of George's
          transformation, but just a little.
                         
          Now George is even shorter, even swarthier. Yet another
          actor.
                         
<b>                          GEORGE (CONT'D)

           left uninvestigated...
                         
          Rick's suspicion is increasing. He looks over to Hertz, who
          feigns total innocence.
                         
          George is now even shorter. Still another actor. His
          clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down
          over his face.

          astonishment.
                         
          George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions. The
          sombrero completely covers his head. When he takes it off,
          we see he's now played by LINDA HUNT!
                         
<b>                          GEORGE

           Totally ridiculous!
                         
          Rick is ready to ask questions, but Hertz cuts him off.
                         
<b>                          HERTZ

           all.
                         
          George nods and heads back to his seat. As he passes behind
          Hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and
          making a face.

          Hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever. The old
          geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were
          being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.

          Rick looks at his advisors--they look over at Linda Hunt,
          then emphatically shake their heads "NO." Rick looks at
          Hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins. Rick breaks
          into a big smile and gives Hertz his trademark thumbs up

          The motley crowd (LOCALS, sleazy looking MOBSTERS, rogue
          BIKERS, wayward HIPPIES, and JAPANESE TOURISTS, etc.) is
          brawling and drinking and having a heck of a time.
                         
          Some small displays and a few carnival booths are set up
          around the sides of the tent. There's a "PETTING ZOO" where
          a KID is petting a two-tailed-no-headed dog. And there's a
          "HEAVY PETTING ZOO" where a GUY is french kissing a six-
          legged goat.
                         
          A CLOWN sits in a dunk tank, heckling the customers. The

          Rick bows. The crowd bursts into applause. They yell
          "Bravo" and throw bouquets. Rick takes several curtain
          calls. The freaks cheer for him. Julie is particularly
          moved--she and Rick exchange a heavy look, laden with
          romantic potential. NOTE: We will insert an almost

          Kevin, the EES executive from the airport scene, walks into

          the stage, runs up to Kevin and hugs him. Kevin is shocked,

          strides confidently up to the podium.
                         
          Stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs. Bill steps over
          him, not even noticing he's there.
                         
          Bill takes Elijah's "Freak World" graphic off an easel, and
          replaces it with his own. Finding no place to deposit
          Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a

          Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the
          back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him,

          executives who occupy the front seats. The security goons
          are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of
          them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row. Elijah
          is onstage.

          Toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens, revealing Rick
          strapped to an operating table. On stage left there's a
          large cage containing all the other freaks. Including the
          unconscious, half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the
          freak house. The Milk Man domes to, looks around in a panic,
          grabs the bars of the cage, and screams--

          Rick searches the cheering audience for Stuey, who waves the
          Pepsi cup full of glop in the air. Rick hears Stuey's voice
          echo in his head telepathically.

          Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed
          BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds
          up a beaker of ointment.

          Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick,
          who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey.

          Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally

          Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to
          its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a
          switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade
          crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He
          drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He
          leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah.

          The lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks
          perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was
          caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile
          behind him.

          The audience applauds and hoots wildly.

           now?
                         
          The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from
          the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience.
          They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with
          their former identities printed on them. "I was NOSEY," "I
          was COWBOY," "I was the BEARDED LADY" etc. Except the Worm,
          who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, "I'm Still THE WORM".

          Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan. He
          pounces and catches the furry little bugger.

          He looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEE's feet--they're big,
          hideous monster feet! Suddenly their eyes glow bright red--
          It's Elijus and Elly Lee! They speak with Elijah's voice.

          Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on
          Rick's throat when...
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG! Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny.
          They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the
          audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. Julie
          stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. She rushes to Rick.
          They embrace.

          Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall
          monster, running towards them. He's carrying a garbage bag
          dripping blood.

          Rick and Julie sigh with relief. Stuey pulls out a similar
          leaking bag and holds it up.

          Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch,
          bloodied, but still fierce. They're about to stab Rick and
          Julie when...
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Five more shots ring out
          and they fall dead--again.
                         
          Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun.

</b>           Right, Coog. I learned somethin'
           too. That men and women truly are
           equals. That the human spirit
           transcends gender and physical
           appearance, and thus it is immune
           to the petty degradations men may
           devise. I believe it was Moliere

          As the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and
          wave at the cheering audience, Elijus and Elly Lee attack
          again. Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead.
          Well, dead-ish. Seconds later, after some more waving, they
          attack again. This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them
          to death, sort of. A little more waving, before Elijus and
          Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt. They can barely
          stand. Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. Worm head-butts
          the other. A few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand
          gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. Stuey has
          to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down
          to punch him in the chops. Ernie stands off to the side,
          charging everyone five bucks per blow.
                         
          As we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing,
          kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of America's favorite
          morning show hosts.
