<b>          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES
</b>
          Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison
          guards.

          Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the
          sneering face of just such a man.
          We follow the guard

<b>          DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY
</b>
          Paint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is
          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.
          He meets them all with--

<b>                         GUARD
</b>          Shut up, convict! Get yer hands
          off the bars!

          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,
          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --
          home of the scum of the scum.
          Meanwhile...

<b>          PRISON VISITING ROOM
</b>
          The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read
          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which
          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do
          their jobs.

          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time
          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their
          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:
          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if
          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to
          life.

          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake
          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.

<b>                         GUARD 2
</b>          Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I
          guess even a turd gets flies to
          land on it.

<b>                         GUARD 3

<b>          2.
</b>          They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,
          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at
          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:

<b>                         GUARD 2
</b>          I.D., visitation papers.

<b>          BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD
</b>          He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most
          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a
          code.
          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it
          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this
          thing must've done something REAL bad.

<b>          WITH DEVIL GIRL
</b>          Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security
          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough
          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the
          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.

<b>                         GUARD 3
</b>          She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but
          you know.
          They laugh, buzz her through.

<b>          WITH THE GUARD
</b>          The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the
          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:

<b>                         GUARD
</b>          Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor.
          Let's go, pretty boy.

<b>                         VISITING ROOM
</b>          Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured
          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face
          of a guard.
          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks
          like they're not taking chances.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>          At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She
          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER

<b>                         BELOVED --
</b>          YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A
          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a
          grubby unshaven face...
          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --
          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the
          way Elvis was in his prime.
          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on
          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.
          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and
          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl
          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.
          A guard pokes them with his billy club --

<b>                         GUARD 2
</b>          This ain't a conjugal visit.
          quit yer conjugating.

<b>                         YAZ

          anything?

          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic
          like that.
          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-
          fingered scoop of frosting.

<b>                         GUARD 2

</b>          But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A
          VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they
          consume the guard's entire face.

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          That's why.
          The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of
          grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as
          their master, snarling and hungry for blood.
          The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he
          launches his aliens, taking them all out.
          Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...

<b>          THE PRISON BREAK IS ON!!
</b>          One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM
          In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator
          glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own
          weapon.
          She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of
          his chains.

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          There's nothing sexier than a girl
          killing for me.

          She runs a hand over his bicep.

<b>                         DEVIL GIRL
</b>          You got so strong in prison.

          Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          I'm not just a man of brute force,
          you know. I prefer to be known for
          my rapier wit--
          His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --
          impaling the guard--

          The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.
          They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw
          open the door.

<b>          YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPE
</b>          Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming,
          chaos.
          Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead
          guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.
          He's a sociopathic badass... and she's no slouch either.
           Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs
          an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket-
          Propelled grenade (RPG).
          He uses and discards them as he goes.
          They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...
          But..
          They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --
          Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.
          All Yaz has left is his RPG.

          Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The
          guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.

          Allow me most honorable benefit of

          Wu walks off. Jay CLOCKS the other diners.

          haven't ordered a thing. When's
          the last time Wu let someone sit at
          a table without ordering? And
          table five over there just drank
          his third cup of duck sauce.

          Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.

<b>          MR. WU
</b>          Sorry, guys.
          Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys
          reach for their weapons.
          And IT GOES DOWN --
          It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --
          The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw
          various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
          It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping
          truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand
          combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not
          taking any chances.
          Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --

          Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white

          Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal. The
          music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample
          was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
          song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
          He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
          one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a
          quarter.
          Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,
          the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.

          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"

          We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what
          sounds like ten Harleys at once.
          Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis
          Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig
          that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.
          His skull ring gleams on his pinkie. Devil Girl sits behind
          him, hands on his shoulders.

          to make a trade for the mama?
          Yaz pulls out his alien "guns." The stoned hippie smiles
          serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths. Makes a

          followed by its brother.
          The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the
          inside-out. On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin',
          don't come a knockin'.
          The guns, finished, return to Yaz.
          Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the
          hippies. But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws
          it away.
          The head back on their way... Blood drips over the Ass, Gas

          secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their
          martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible!
          - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool.
          - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go
          clean something up.
          - An MiB barbershop quartet practices.

          Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game.

          (including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of
          wires hanging out) and lots of money.. LOTS of money...
          Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF

          agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his
          peep show window.
          One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:

</b>
<b>                         (CHEERFUL)

<b>                         SLEAZY GUY
</b>          Yeah, I know.
          The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest
          emporium of sleaze.

          The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off

<b>                         PASSENGERS --
</b>           We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS --
          Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress...
          We see -- it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK.
          And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE

<b>          PAPER-HATTED VENDOR.
</b>          DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer:

</b>          Just a few more questions about dry
          ice and I'll be out of your hair...
          A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over,
          pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans
          into the Station!

<b>                         VENDOR

          The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to
          Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot.
          Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant!
          They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner --
          And it's just some Hare Krishnas.

          The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs
          warning WET PAINT!
          The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through
          a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING"
          Jay and Kay follow...
          Through the skinny half-painted door...

          reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --

          Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case
          file picture...

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Hey. My watch stopped.
          We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something
          about it bothers him...

<b>                         KAY
</b>          C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard
          leave the atmosphere.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a
          second.

<b>          KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR
</b>          Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the
          scaffolding.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          So you guys understand all this
          time stuff, right? So is
          everything going to be okay now? I
          mean, if I saved everything, and
          Yaz is really gone, why am I even
          here? Shouldn't I not have come in
          the first place? And why do I
          still have time left on my watch?

<b>                         UNDERGROUND
</b>          The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of
          underground hallways.
          Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          102.
</b>          ,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          3:59. But Kay didn't get killed
          until...
          And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't
          come yet!!!
          Jay races to find Kay.

<b>                         WITH KAY
</b>          Unaware that his appointment with death is near...

<b>          WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL
</b>          Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay...

<b>                         WITH JAY
</b>          Running... running... searching... where is Kay?

<b>          INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...
</b>          All converging on destiny...

<b>                         WITH JAY
</b>          Running... more frantic now...
          And then he sees him!
          Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to
          the outside...

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Kay!
          And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
          Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
          Yaz pulls his guns...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          103.
</b>          Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to
          know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
          Yaz FIRES!!
          But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the
          bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
          And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND
          KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
          LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
          They look at each other -- it's over.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          See? I knew you had my back.
          Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL

<b>          MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.
</b>          As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,
          shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.

<b>                         KID'S VOICE
</b>          Dad? What's going on?
          The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape
          of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG

<b>          JAY.
</b>
<b>                         JAY
</b>          Where there is death, there will
          always be death. He saved your
          life. He swapped his for yours.
          He saved the world.
          Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --

<b>                         KAY
</b>          I'll take it from here.
          Kay steps away... but turns back.
          In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses
          Kay a modern Neuralizer.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Leave me some memories this time,

<b>          OK?
</b>
<b>                         KAY
</b>          Sure, partner. I'll see you
          around.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          104.
</b>
<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yes you will.
          Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
          Jay watches them from a distance:
          Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body
          was -- hands it to the son.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to
          have this.
          Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
          Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and
          worn.

<b>                         YOUNG JAY
</b>          Where is he?

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Your daddy had to go -- he's part
          of the space program, now. He's
          okay, he just had to take a trip up
          to the stars, but you'll be just
          fine. I'll keep an eye on you...
          They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
          launch...
          Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...

<b>          PURE WHITE LIGHT...
</b>          And it resolves into...

<b>          NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY...
</b>          Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and

<b>          THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING!!!
</b>
<b>                         JAY
</b>          Noo!!!!
          And then...
          A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and

<b>          PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE
</b>

<b>          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING
</b>
          Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security
          guard.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          It's good to see you, man.
          He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.

<b>          INT. MIB HQ
</b>
          Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.
          No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV
          he never left... It all seems the same except for quick shots
          of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee
          cart...
          Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to
          everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.
          He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.
          A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on
          winning the Bowling trophy... AGAIN.
          Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Alright, everyone, give me and my
          partner here a minute.
          They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him
          in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          It's good to see you, man. So
          good. I just... do you remember...
          I mean, do you know what I've been
          through?
          Kay just stares at him.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          You mean, do I remember that you
          travelled back in time to save my
          life and the world? Not bad,
          slick. Not bad.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          No problem. You'd do the same for
          me. I just have one question...

</b>          When you disappeared... Why didn't
          I forget you when everyone else
          did?

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Well, I don't know exactly.
          Because I was dead. But in a
          quantum reality, objects can exist
          in contradictory states... So
          multiple timelines with varying
          probabilities can exist, and the
          one you're closest to

<b>                         MATHEMATICALLY--

<b>                         JAY

          closeness... you're talking about
          our love... Across timelines!
          You're saying our love will go on!
          Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.
          Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it
          out.

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          He was a good man.

</b>          Yes he was.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          I'm glad I know that.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          So you travelled back in time, huh?

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yep.

<b>                         KAY
