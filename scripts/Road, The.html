          The intense BUZZING of summer insects and the SONG of

          hay stack. A MAN with a horse. A clapboard house with a

          lying in grass, lazing...

          Next to book shelves and an upright piano, with sheet music
          on the stand - CHOPIN. There is also a dining room table with
          leftovers from an abandoned meal - strawberries and cream.

          MONTH LATER - a warm night, the MAN is asleep with the same
          WOMAN, now pregnant, no sheets on the bed. The MAN is
          restless and wakes. A distant RUMBLING, indistinct - the MAN
          swings his feet off of the bed and goes to the window,
          anxious.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The MAN is in his shorts, sweating, putting a plug in the
          bath and turning on the taps as far as they will go. The
          WOMAN appears in the doorway in a nightdress and leans
          against the door frame watching, blearily, cradling her
          pregnant belly.

          The WOMAN takes off her nightdress and goes to the bath.

          He looks at her, surprised she's misunderstood. 

<b>          MAN. 
</b>          I'm not! Put your clothes back on. 
          She sees he's looking out the window now - there's an eery

          distant shouts and screams...

<b>          EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN
</b>
          A MAN of about forty and a BOY of ten are asleep, camped on a
          tarp under a rock ledge, the blackened chasm of a burnt
          valley spread out below. It is the same man seen earlier -
          but ten years older, thinner, malnourished, with a thick
          beard. They are both emaciated and exhausted, their faces and
          hands coated in grime and soot from the burned, blackened
          landscape around them. Ash falls on the tarp, which is bright
          synthetic blue, the only color in sight.
           The MAN is woken by something, he instinctively reaches out 
           to touch the BOY, his hand rests on his chest and rises and 
           falls with each of the sleeping BOY's breaths. 
           There is a low RUMBLE, the ground starts to TREMBLE and the 
          BOY wakes. 

<b>           BOY. 
</b>           Papa? (NO REPLY.) Papa? 

<b>           MAN. 
</b>           Shh. It's okay. 

<b>           BOY. 
</b>           What is it, Papa? 
          They listen as it grows NEARER and LOUDER, everything
          SHAKING, tree roots GROANING and SPLITTING, until it passes
          between them with a ROAR like a subway train right beneath
          them. The BOY is now clinging to the MAN and crying, his head
          buried against his chest in fear.

<b>          MAN. 
</b>          Shh. It's all right. It's all 
          right. It's gone. 

<b>          BOY. 
</b>          What was it, Papa?

<b>          MAN.
</b>          It was an earthquake.

<b>          EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b>
          In the burnt, barren landscape, through swirls of soft ash
          and smoggy air the MAN appears dressed in a filthy old PARKA
          with the hood up, a knapsack on his back, pushing a rusted
          shopping CART with a bicycle mirror clamped to the handle and
          the BLUE tarp now covering it's load. The little BOY,
          similarly dressed with a KNAPSACK on his back, shuffles
          through the ash at his side - like Depression-era Dust Bowl
          homeless.
           There is a flicker of lightning over head, then more, but no 
          thunder. 

<b>           MAN. (V.0.)
</b>          The clocks stopped at one seventeen
          one morning. There was a long shear
          of bright light, then a series of
          low concussions.

<b>          EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/ CRACKED ROAD - DAY 
</b>
           Broken asphalt, the earthquake has caused a large FISSURE to 
          open up ALONGSIDE the road, with a sheer drop. 
           THE MAN and THE BOY edge past burnt trees and scrub. 

<b>          MAN. (V.0.)
</b>          Within a year there were fires on
          the ridges and deranged chanting.
          The screams of the murdered. By day
          the dead impaled on spikes along
          the road.

<b>          EXT. LAKE - DAY 
</b>
           They trudge past a vast lake filled with dead trees... 

<b>           MAN. (V.0.) 
</b>           I think it's October but I can't be 
           sure. I haven't kept a calender for 
           5 years. 

<b>          EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY 
</b>
          They truck along with the trolley through the fog, the
          ghostly shapes of dead trees on either side and the shapes of
          barren mountains in the background...

          colder week by week as the planet
          slowly dies. No animals have
          survived. All the crops are long
          gone.

           A tree falls behind them with a WHUMP and they jump...

           The MAN forages for petrol, checking the nozzle of the pumps, 
           rummaging through empty oil cans, he upends a bin to get at 
          the empty oil bottles. 
           The BOY picks up a phone on a wall and listens to the dead 
          earpiece. 

<b>           MAN. (V.0.)

<b>          EXT. LONG ROAD - DAY 
</b>
           They head down a long straight road towards a dark, 
           forbidding looking tunnel - a turnpike. 

<b>           MAN. (V.0.)

</b>
           They are camped high up on the ridge of a mountainside. 
           There is a camp fire with wet clothes hanging to dry on
          sticks beside it.
           The MAN is erecting the tarp over string tied between two 
           sticks stuck in the ground. The BOY is sitting lighting a
           lantern using the scavenged oil inside the makeshift tent, 
           his shadow stark against the illuminated tarp. 

<b>           BOY.

           He gets out a BOOK and looks at the pictures in the

           The MAN reads him a story...

          The MAN awakens bathed in firey light as if the sun has come
          out. There is pale gray snow all around him with a quivering
          orange glow. He gets up to investigate, looks to the line of
          trees up the ridge where a FOREST FIRE is burning, CRACKLING
          in the distance. He stands staring at the fire, the warmth
          and light moving him, enlivening him and not frightening him
          at all. The BOY has got up and appears at his side, yawning.
          He looks at the sky at a single gray SNOWFLAKE drifting down.

           The BOY catches the snowflake in his hand, surprised.

<b>          EXT. ROAD/PLAIN - DAY
</b>
          They travel along the road through drifting wood smoke, smoke
          pouring off the ground like mist and thin black trees burning
          like candles on the snowy ridge.
          They reach a spot where fire has crossed the road melting the
          tarmac. Their feet stick in the molten tarmac, it sucks at
          their shoes and they stop. Just ahead they see a set of foot
          prints in the tar and study them.

<b>          BOY.
</b>          Who is it?

<b>          MAN.
</b>          I don't know.
          The MAN looks through a pair of BINOCULARS and sees: A
          stooped figure up ahead, a DYING MAN dragging one leg
          slightly, limping along. He stops and stands uncertainly,
          then continues. The BOY sees him too.

<b>          BOY.
</b>          What should we do Papa?

<b>          MAN.
</b>          We're all right. Let's just follow

</b>          Yeah. Take a look.

<b>          EXT. ROAD/HILL - LATE AFTERNOON

          The DYING MAN is getting slower and slower as they climb a
          slope, following, until he finally stops and simply sits in
          the road. The BOY hangs onto the MAN's coat anxiously as they
          approach.
          POV BOY - the DYING MAN is burnt, his clothing scorched and
          skin black with soot. One eye is burnt shut and his hair is a
          nitty wig of ash. His shoes are bound with wire and coated
          with road tar.

<b>          MAN. (CONT'D)
</b>          You see that? Two left. One for you
          and one for me.
          He places the BOY's thumb on the hammer and cocks the pistol.
          He curls the BOY's index finger around the trigger.

<b>          MAN. (CONT'D)
</b>          You put it in your mouth and point
          it up. Like this. Just like I
          showed you.
          He puts the barrel of the pistol in his own mouth until the
          BOY nods, wide eyed. He takes the pistol out of his mouth and
          uncocks it.

<b>          MAN. (CONT'D)

          FLASHBACK - the WOMAN is sitting by the window, staring out
          at the garden which is barren now, the sky gray but tinged
          with the same fireglow seen earlier, a film of gray ash
          covers dead lawn and shrubs and inside the paintwork is grimy
          and colorless now, a lot of the furniture gone. A pile of
          broken up furniture and pieces of the piano are-stacked up
          next to the fireplace. In the fireplace the scorched, ashen
          remains of piano keys. The WOMAN is now heavily pregnant. The
          MAN sets down chipped old plates and spoons, spoons beans
          from a pot and sits to eat.
          As the WOMAN starts to eat she winces and freezes with a look
          of horror, spoon halfway to her mouth. She looks down and

          Instead of cutlery it contains a pair of kitchen shears, a
          bottle of antiseptic, worn but clean towels and a pair of
          worn out yellow rubber dish gloves, all laid out in
          readiness.
          The WOMAN appears at the door, blood running down a leg.

           Inside a badly damaged trailer home, one wall half fallen 
           off, a pan of water boils on a small fire. The BOY sits 
          shivering in a blankets as he eats beans from a tin, scraping
          around for the last one or two. The MAN opens his knapsack by
          the fire and produces a packet of COCOA. He fixes a cup of
          cocoa for the boy. He hands the BOY the cup of cocoa and as
          the BOY examines it and drinks, the MAN surreptitiously pours
          himself a mug of water and sits blowing on it. The BOY
          realises the MAN has left him all the cocoa.

          wipes his finger around the inside of the empty bean tin and
          licks his finger.

          advertising MOTELS and stop. The BOY notices a sign in the
          distance, which has words painted over a faded advertisement:
          odd, nonsensical, Biblical ramblings about "bones" and "the
          dead." The MAN follows the BOY's gaze and reads: "BEHOLD THE

</b>
          They trudge along the turnpike towards the opening of a deep,
          black tunnel and the BOY suddenly comes to a stop,
          increasingly upset, unable to face the yawning mouth of the
          tunnel.

          The boy sticks close to the MAN's side. The man has the 
          revolver in his belt now and his parka unzipped, ready as 
          they nervously walk towards the mouth of the tunnel.

          cautiously ahead, acutely aware of all that's around them.
          They pass footprints in the dried sludge on the ground. Ash
          and litter blowing about and a handful of MUMMIFIED DEAD
          REFUGEES appear along the sides of the tunnel, sitting and
          lying on camp stretchers, their bags and supplies long since
          looted. They are shrivelled and drawn like latterday bogfolk,
          shoeless, a couple of men, a woman a small child and a DOG.
          The MAN stares at the group. 
          The BOY stares at the small child and then at the mummified 
          DOG, transfixed. The MAN puts out his hand for the BOY to
          take - the BOY takes his hand and the MAN moves him on.

          small hand goes up and down on his chest.
          Suddenly the MAN wakes and rolls onto his side, listening,
          the revolver lying beside him. He slips his hand onto the
          revolver and raises his head slowly. He looks around - 
          nothing but the sound of a distant DIESEL ENGINE. He looks at
          the BOY fast asleep. When he looks back at the tunnel he sees

          side to side and swinging clubs and lengths of pipe - a ROAD

          the gang.

          The BOY falls and the MAN pulls him to his feet with such

          back down again.

          The MAN and the BOY crouch in frozen silence, the Truck now
          on the overpass nearby, dangerously exposed to the view of

          blue overalls and a gas company cap, and has a long beard cut
          square at the bottom and a bad tattoo of a bird on his neck.
          He doesn't stop, just keeps coming, closer and closer until
          he's just feet away, almost on top of them. He unzips his
          pants and takes a piss. As he stands pissing his eyes roam
          around - at any moment he could look to the side and see them
          crouching there.
          The MAN is wide-eyed, gun ready, eyes darting from the GANG

          your while.
          The MAN glances in the direction of the ROAD GANG, then back
          at the GANG MEMBER, who is still eyeing the BOY. The BOY is
          sitting with his hands on top of his head, peeking out
          through his arms, terrified as the tension escalates.

<b>          MAN.

          you in the head.

<b>          GANG MEMBER.
</b>          I'll bet that boy is hungry. Why
          don't you all just come onto the
          truck. Get something to eat. Ain't
          no need to be such a hard ass.

          killed a man in your life.
          He drops his belt on the ground with a CLATTER, a canteen and
          army pouch hanging from it. The MAN eyes the army pouch, eyes
          the GANG on the road - and notices for the first time some of
          them are wearing the same army pouches.

          their lost member. The MAN is distracted by this and when he
          looks up the GANG MEMBER has taken two silent steps and is
          standing between him and the BOY, holding a knife.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          What do you think you're going to
          do with that?
          Without a word the GANG MEMBER dives and grabs the BOY, rolls
          and lands on his feet holding the BOY against his chest with
          his knife at his throat. Simultaneously the MAN drops to his
          knees, trains the pistol and fires from six feet away,
          shooting the GANG MEMBER in the forehead. He falls back and
          lies with blood bubbling from the wound, eyes open, the BOY
          lying in his lap in shock, deafened, expressionless, covered
          with gore and mute as a stone.
          The GANG hear the loud SHOT and freeze, they start looking
          around them more urgently now. The MAN grabs the dazed BOY by
          the hand and yells but in his deafness the BOY hears only a
          MUTED soup of words:

<b>          MAN (MUTED.)
</b>          Move! Let's go!
          The MAN shoves the pistol in his belt, hoists the BOY onto
          his shoulders and sets off down the road at a run.

          They crash through the woods, the MAN straining to keep the
          BOY aloft and find a path through the trees - the BOY
          clutching the MAN's head with both hands.
          There's a sickening THUD and the MAN falls, the BOY flying
          off with a cry. The MAN struggles to gather his wits, unsure
          whether he's been felled by another man.

<b>          MAN (MUTED.)

          The MAN swings the BOY onto his shoulders and runs.

          The MAN and BOY stagger through trees and the man drops to
          his knees, letting the BOY down. They are back by the
          turnpike again. They listen and watch, utterly exhausted and 
          out of breath, the MAN is wheezing, the BOY at his side,
          holding his hand, staring, in shock still.

          But he sees the MAN talking and looking around, through 360
          degrees, trying to work out where it's safe to go.

          The MAN pulls out blankets from his knapsack. The BOY sits
          staring, shocked as the MAN tries to wipe the blood and gore
          from his face but it's thick and congealed now. His hands
          tremble as he tries to pick it from the BOY's hair.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          It's okay... it's okay now...
          Frightened by the BOY's muteness, he wraps him in a blanket,
          unzips his parka and holds him close under the parka.
          The MAN picks up his revolver, checks the chamber, only one
          bullet left. He eyes the flickering shadows in the distance
          and then eyes the BOY, making minute calculations of
          distance, calibrating the space between the ROAD GANG and the
          BOY. He holds the revolver up and cocks it.

          do it? When the time comes?
          There is no moon, but not far away, perhaps 30 yards, a firey 
          TORCH makes its way through the woods. About 50 yards away
          from that another TORCH is being used to search... shadows
          flicker ominously. The sounds of TWIGS snapping underfoot and
          BRANCHES being broken as the ROAD GANG searches wordlessly,
          just BREATHING heavily through their masks and beards. The
          MAN clutches the BOY tighter, and stifles a cough.
          They remain frozen like this, unable to budge.

          They are by a thin, toxic, rust-red stream, slushy ice at the
          edges and gray froth. The MAN leans down and pushes ice away 
          and scoops up a hand full of gray water. He runs it through
          the boy's hair to wash it and the BOY flinches with cold. He
          rubs more icy water into the BOY's hair, roughly, quickly,
          with a sense of panic as he helplessly tries to-wash out
          lumps of flesh and blood. The BOY is weeping silently and
          shivering from the extreme cold as the MAN picks out the
          dried gore and washes the hair clean.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          It's no use crying. You have to
          talk to me.
          He takes the blanket and dries the BOY's hair as he talks.

          He smooths the BOY's hair down with shaking fingers, clumsily
          trying to brush it out of his eyes, a fatherly instinct to
          make the BOY neat.

<b>          MAN. (CONT'D)
</b>          Because that's my job. Do you

          When he's through the MAN lifts the BOY's thin arms, puts a
          vest over his head, then a ragged sweater, then he folds the
          BOY into his parka, zips it up to the neck and kisses him on
          the top of the head.
          The MAN grabs his knapsack, tips it upside down, rummages
          inside - it's empty.

          He starts to climb the embankment and hears: little running

          You don't remember. It was before
          you were born. There used to be so
          many thnings... 
          The BOY approaches the water's edge, shallow and clear with 
          gravel and pebbles sparkling at the bottom. He scoops up some
          water, surprised that it seems clean.

<b>          BOY.

</b>          Just don't swallow any.
          The MAN unzips his parka and slips it to the ground. The BOY
          eyes the MAN, surprised - then does the same.

<b>          EXT. RIVER/WATERFALL - DAY
</b>
          Naked, pale, filthy dirty and shivering with cold, the BOY
          frolics in the spray of the waterfall. The MAN watches him 
          enjoying himself by the waterfall, clutching his shoulders, 
          hopping up and down, he joins him.

<b>          EXT. RAVINE/ROCKFACE - (CAMP 6) - EVENING 
</b>
          The MAN has strung the tarp against a rockface to make a
          shelter. He meticulously filters water through a rag into a
          pan. In the background, the waterfall can be heard RUMBLING.
          The BOY has painted his face with CRAYONS, drawing a bizarre
          set of FANGS and dripping blood around his mouth. The MAN
          studies the BOY's painted face a moment.

          The MAN and the BOY are trudging along, away from the 
          waterfall now.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          We have to keep moving. Other

          They come around a bend in the road and immediately hear the 
          ROAR of river rapids. Up ahead they see a bridge with a jack-
          knifed TRUCK on it.

<b>          EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
          They walk out onto the bridge over GREY FROTHING WATER, and
          inspect the truck. The tyres are flat, the cab jammed against
          the railings. The trailer end has swung across the road,
          knocked out the railings and lies with it's last few feet
          hanging over the side of the bridge, blocking the bridge off
          completely.

          The MAN climbs up onto the gas tanks, wipes the glass and

          inside, pulling the door shut behind.

          He looks around at discarded detritus, old magazines and

          on a bunk and calls out.

          SNOW continues to fall on the dusty WINDSCREEN. Outside, all
          around snow falls, silently, covering the truck and the
          bridge, transforming it. They are both still awake, unable to
          sleep, staring at the transformed world, carpeted by snow.

          and walks away from the truck, vanishing into the mist.

<b>          EXT. CAMP/ROAD - (CAMP 7) - EARLY HOURS

          The MAN is alone now by the road. He takes out his WALLET and
          sifts through: money, ancient cards, driver's license and a
          picture of HIMSELF and the WOMAN on their WEDDING DAY, which 
          he studies a moment sadly.

<b>          MAN. (V.0.)

          it was her final gift... she died

          no other tale to tell.
          He lays everything out on the grey slushy ground, then flings
          the wallet into the river and walks back to camp, leaving the

           The MAN and the BOY approach the edge of the city. Up ahead a 
          cluster of three tall buildings, a dozen or so floors of
          concrete and glass, the upper floors of one illuminated by
          the flickering fire glow of candle light inside. The MAN
          stops and stares and the BOY follows his gaze.
          In one of the illuminated windows a SILHOUETTE FIGURE stares
          back at them, somebody in the building. In another window
          another SILHOUETTE FIGURE is staring out, motionless, they
          could be refugees, cannibals or more mummified dead for all
          we know.

           When they get to the end of the block they stop and the MAN
           checks around the corner before they cross the street. In the 
           distance three men appear, emaciated, slow-moving. They step 
           forward, stop and watch the BOY and the MAN.

<b>          EXT. COUNTRY RAILWAY LINE - DAY

          In the country, along the railway, they see past a small road
          to a once grand house on a rise. It is tall and stately with
          white Doric columns across the front and a gravel drive that
          curves up from the road through a field of dead, foot long
          grass. They stand there staring at it, the BOY still holding
          the MAN's hand. The MAN listens - nothing but the WIND in the
          dead bracken, a CREAK of a door or shutter rattling.

          tiles and the MAN carefully shuts the window a little so it's
          the same as when he found it. They regard the room, 
          binoculars set up on a tripod sit next to an arm chair. An 
          elaborate staircase in front of them, William Morris wall
          paper, water stained and sagging, plaster moldings and
          cornices sagging from the ceiling.
          They cross back to the other side where there is a great hall
          of a drawing room, high ceilings, huge fire place with raw
          brick around it where the wood has been stripped, a pile of 
          warm-weather clothing, boots and backpacks on the floor by 
          the hearth.

          rusted sink covered in mould, bare cupboards. In the floor is
          a hatch with a lock set in a steel plate. The man examines it
          while the BOY tugs at his arm, frightened.

          blackened remnants of a fire. There is also a wooden SMOKE
          HOUSE with thin wisps of smoke coming off it. The MAN studies
          it nervously, sniffing the air, then goes to the tool shed
          and starts sorting through tools. He finds a long handled
          spade and hefts it in his hands.

          The spade chops into the wood around the lock on the hatch.
          The MAN hacks away, then prizes up the hatch, lock and all,
          revealing a gap of darkness.

          The MAN opens the hatch fully and lies it on the floor.

          There is a terrible stench and they have to cover their
          mouths and noses with their parkas. The MAN gets out his
          lighter, lights it and tries to light the way.
          POV MAN - BLACKNESS except the small area illuminated by the
          lighter as the MAN searches: part of a stone wall; then a
          clay floor; an old mattress with dark stains. The glow of the
          flame crawls across the floor to a corner as the MAN steps
          closer, then plays the lighter along from the corner to

          shining eyes from the light, NAKED MEN and WOMEN, thin as
          skeletons like inmates in a death camp. The BOY jumps,
          shocked and the MAN freezes, staring, dumb struck by:
          On a mattress on the floor lies a NAKED MAN with his legs
          gone to the hip, their stumps blackened and burned,
          cauterized. The BOY covers his eyes.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          Jesus...
          The MAN on the MATTRESS turns to them and WHISPERS, a low
          indistinct murmur at first.

          The others join in, an eerie chorus of WHISPERING, "Help

          The MAN drops the lighter as he tries to push the BOY up the

          picks up the BOY in his arms and they sprint to a door under
          the stairs. As they get through the door the front door
          swings open and the WELL-FED PEOPLE drift inside.

<b>          INT. REST ROOM - DAY
</b>
          They are in a small rest room under the stairs, just a toilet
          and a basin. The BOY's face is level with the basin and while
          the MAN is holding the door shut the BOY comes face to face
          with the contents of the basin:
          POV BOY - bloodstained clothing soaking in bloody water and
          tallow in the basin. Around the basin are bloody red hand
          prints on the white porcelain.
          POV MAN - through a thin crack he sees the WELL-FED PEOPLE on
          the far side of the foyer, chatting casually. He is not close
          enough to hear everything they say, but close enough to see
          that the MEN's beards are trimmed and they wear well-repaired
          clothes.

          and up the stairs to change while the other WOMAN takes a few
          steps towards the rest room, then turns back towards the

          As all this goes on, the MAN is frozen, eyes wide with fear,
          he slips the pistol from his belt, cocks it and squats on his
          haunches so he's close to the BOY, desperate, unable to
          decide what to do, unable to think straight with fear.
          The BOY is staring from the door to the pistol to the
          bloodied basin as if hypnotised, in shock, babbling somewhat.

          There are FOOT STEPS outside the door as the WELL FED PEOPLE
          drift closer and then away again. The man starts to cough but
          he has the revolver in one hand and the BOY's hand in his
          other. The MAN tries to stifle his cough but can't. Then the
          BOY notices and holds his own small hand to the MAN's mouth,
          stifling his coughing as the talk goes on outside:

          torturous contemplation, the MAN very gently takes the gun
          from the BOY's hand and the BOY sits forlornly, staring down
          at his hands, afraid to look at the MAN now. When the BOY
          looks up again he is staring down the barrel of the pistol,
          the MAN aiming the large revolver at the BOY's forehead.

          The MAN and the BOY trudge the empty aisles, only litter
          remaining, the once brightly-colored packaging strewn around,
          it's contents long since looted.
          In the empty gun section there is a deer's head mounted on
          the wall. The BOY stops and stares, mesmerised while the MAN
          searches the empty shelves for ammo, finding only empty
          boxes.
          The MAN glimpses a woman's face staring dolefully from an
          aisle - an emaciated, dead beat SCAVENGER watching them,
          vanishing as quickly as she appeared. 
          On their way out they come to a pair of vending machines 
          tipped over, the sodas looted, coins scattered around in the
          ash. The MAN sits beside one and feels inside the gutted
          machine, eventually producing a single unopened can of COCA

          He helps the little BOY off with his knapsack and sits him
          down and opens the can of COKE ceremoniously. The BOY looks
          startled and sniffs the fizzing can as if it's the strangest

          They head out of the mall now towards the road, lifeless

          They trudge through the suburbs on the edge of the city, past
          what used to be the local ball park, now barren, dead, a vast
          flat expanse of ash and cracked, scorched earth, forlorn
          stands and bleachers blackened by ash and soot.

<b>          BOY.

          They walk up a once tree-lined suburban street, barren now,
          ash and dust layer what used to be front lawns, post boxes,
          picket fences, porches, crazy paving. The MAN stops outside a
          typical, suburban clapboard house with a dead, cracked yard
          where the lawn used to be and a bare flag pole. The BOY eyes
          the MAN enquiringly.

<b>          BOY.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          It's the house where I grew up.
          They go up to the house - clapboards have been removed for
          firewood leaving studs and insulation exposed. The BOY stops,
          reluctant to go further, and the MAN takes a few more steps
          then turns around to check on him.

          The MAN takes the BOY's hand and they approach a basketball
          hoop by the garage. The MAN is momentarily overcome with
          emotion as he recalls the details, but it doesn't mean much
          to the BOY.
          After a moment the MAN goes up the steps - frightened, but
          horribly compelled at the same time. The BOY follows
          nervously.

</b>          We'll be all right. Come on.
          He goes through the front door - the BOY stays where he is,
          rigid with fear. The BOY notices a stuffed toy dog in the
          window, staring out at the garden and his curiosity takes
          over. The BOY goes inside carefully.

<b>          INT. DINING ROOM/HOME - EVENING

          The pine panelling is stripped from the walls, there is some
          broken furniture but much has been taken for firewood. They
          go over to the fireplace and the MAN examines it. He runs his
          fingers along the mantle where there is an old drawing pin
          still stuck in the wood, nostalgia overcoming his fear.

<b>          MAN.

          Christmas when I was a boy. We'd

          Much of the woodwork and the floorboards have been stripped
          and taken for firewood - there are gaping holes.
          By the fireplace is a small pile of bones - and--in the grid
          are more burnt bones and the skull from the family cat. The
          MAN takes it all in sadly but the BOY is unmoved.

          The floorboards CREAK horribly, swollen from rain or ripped
          up, as he creeps into the living room. The timber cladding is
          stripped from the walls, the ceiling plaster is collapsed,
          beams exposed. The MAN pads through to the kitchen.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN/OLD HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          The kitchen is similarly dilapidated, the cupboards stripped
          bare. On a shelf by the window are dusty jars of fruit,
          preserved. He grabs a jar, prizes open the lid and finds a an
          oily slick of black mucus floating in the top, like rotted
          mushroom spores. He sniffs it suspiciously, holds it up to
          the light.

          The BOY is sitting on the steps of the porch drawing with
          crayons on a pad taken from his knapsack. Across the road is
          another big old house, much of the clapboard missing, swathed
          in dead brambles - the BOY suddenly looks up and stares at
          it, distracted.

<b>          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY
</b>
          The MAN comes outside and regards the deadened yard, old
          garden hoe and spade, gardening equipment and several dead
          apple trees. He goes over and examines the ashen ground and
          digs about to unearth several small, dark brown, shrivelled 
          spheres spaced several feet apart - apples. He bends down and
          picks one up, examines, sniffs. He gathers up the strange
          apples and stuffs them in his pockets.

<b>          EXT. PORCH/OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The BOY is still staring at the house across the road when he
          notices A GHOSTLY FACE, completely still, in a window. The
          BOY drops the pad and crayon and stands, surprised, not
          believing his eyes - it is the face of a SMALL BOY roughly
          his age, which disappears almost immediately, receding back
          into the gloom like a ghost.

          trees sees a clearing - snow and a mass of BLOOD RED
          FOOTPRINTS, the icy snow stained blood red like a sorbet. A

          The BOY copies him, leaving his own maze of tracks. They run

          TWO MEN come prowling on the ROAD, they are MILITANTS from
          some sort of ARMY, wearing the same red neckerchiefs and
          carrying weapons, searching, predatory.
          WIDER - we see that only 30 feet away, concealed amongst the
          trees, the MAN and BOY are crouched in blankets, watching.
          The two MILITANTS stop and look around, as if they sense the
          BOY and the MAN - who freeze, frightened to breathe. The
          MILITANTS sniff the air menacingly.
          One of them walks over to a stone by the side of the road,
          leans down and starts sharpening his lance, made from a the
          straightened coil spring of a car. The MAN and the BOY watch -
          wide-eyed. Eventually the MILITANTS walk off up the road.

          on the ground and blankets on top. Out of the murky sky more
          gray snow is falling. The MAN is distracted by a sudden
          noise, the LOUD CRACK of sheering wood - this time very
          close. He looks around just as:
          Out of nowhere a tree branch sails down, barely missing them, 
          landing with a heavy WHUMP just feet away. 

<b>          MAN.

          He tries to get the BOY to his feet but he is limp, staring 
          around blearily, exhausted.
          They hear another loud WHUMP. Then the GROAN of timber and
          another WHUMP as trees start to keel over around them. The
          MAN grabs the BOY and runs as best he can through the snow
          and falling trees. They have abandoned their blankets, tarp
          and backpacks.

<b>          MAN.

          They rush through the woods as more and more trees fall one
          after the other, WHUMP, WHUMP, WHUMP, great loads of snow
          falling from limbs to the ground with a BOOM, setting the
          woods shuddering. The BOY is getting bogged in the snow and
          the MAN stoops and scoops up the BOY and they cram themselves
          under a fat fallen tree to shield themselves.

           The BOY is wrapped up inside the man's coat, wet and

          down and sleep now.

          town, the BOY at his side, fields stretching out before them,
          the land flattened and dead, ravaged fences running the
          perimeter. In the yard are a few dead trees, a fence, a metal
          tool shed, an old barbecue on the patio made from a 44 gallon
          drum. The MAN slides the patio door open and peers inside

          it has been stripped, the wooden frame gone from the window,
          the bureau ransacked and chopped up - only a summer dress on
          a wire hanger on the back of the door remains. He glances at
          empty drawers on the floor and a cupboard before turning his
          attention to the bed.
          He blinks and sways a moment, trying to focus on:
          POV MAN - underneath the filthy, dusty blankets a thin, dried
          head pokes out, the blankets pulled up to the chin. On the
          pillow are long hunks of rotted hair.

          He takes hold of the lower hem of the blanket and tows it off
          the bed, revealing a desiccated corpse. He ignores it,

          He stops suddenly. He stamps about a bit, listening. He
          continues on into the shed. Beside the shed sits an
          INDUSTRIAL GARDEN TROLLEY. The man reappears, spade in hand.
          He digs the spade into the dead grass and hear's it CHOMP
          into wood. He digs more urgently, increasingly exhausted,
          until a door is revealed in the dirt.

          fresh water and cartons containing as many tins of food and
          supplies as they could manage. The BOY trails along behind.
          They are a strange sight, clean clothed, clean shaven, short
          haired, in their new jumpers - and now both wearing new
          surgical masks which they raise off their faces to speak.
          The MAN keeps checking behind him.

          The BOY watches anxiously as the MAN gets out his own
          BINOCULARS and looks through them.

          silent as he hobbles ahead. He wears layers of torn clothing
          and his feet are wrapped in rags and cardboard tied with
          green twine. They slowly approach and the man stops, turns
          and watches them suspiciously as they draw level.

           spits it into the misty ground.

          Some distance away the BOY looks back at the THIEF, still
          crying.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          You have to stop crying.

<b>          BOY.
</b>          I can't.
          The BOY looks back one last time as the THIEF disappears from
          view - still just standing there, utterly lost.
          The MAN stops and puts his shoes on. He walks back up the
          road to the bend but the THIEF has gone.

          The MAN looks helplessly at the tearful BOY as he fits his
          shoes on for him, the tears streaking the soot on his face.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          What do you want to do?

<b>          BOY.

          The MAN looks back down the road, weighing it up.

          The MAN stops and faces-the innocent BOY angrily, stares,

          As the light fades to darkness they look for the THIEF to 
          give him his clothes back and call out "Hallo!" Etc. After a
          moment they stop.

<b>          BOY.

</b>          I don't know. I think so.
          They keep walking, hands cupped to mouths, hallooing
          mindlessly. The MAN stops to rest and watches the BOY a
          moment, he has stopped crying as he calls out for the thief.
          Finally the MAN piles the THIEF's shoes and clothes in the
          road. He puts a rock on top of them.

<b>          MAN.

          They find a spot to stop and sit, exhausted. The MAN opens
          the first aid kit he took from the boat, selects various
          pills, crushes them up, pours a cup of water from a ferry can
          in the trolley, and hands them to the BOY.

          that's not going to happen. 
          They look at each other a moment, unsure, the BOY shivering
          and sick-looking. The BOY lies down and shuts his eyes. The
          MAN puts a blanket over him. The MAN walks away a few paces
          and coughs endlessly, a nagging cough that won't go.

<b>          EXT. ORCHARD - DAY
</b>
          THE MAN'S DREAM - a dream and a memory of an early summer
          day, the MAN and the WOMAN are in an orchard, lying in the 
          sun on a picnic blanket, an array of food, bread, fruit and
          wine beside them. The MAN lies back and the WOMAN cradles his 
          head in her lap, stroking his brow. She brings her face down
          and gently plants a simple kiss on each of his eyelids, then
          on each of his lips.
          POV MAN - the WOMAN's face, smiling a dazzling, radiant 
          smile, framed by sunlight and the indistinct shapes of leaves
          and blossom and petals against the sky - to him she is
          angelic. Then he kisses her on each eye and on the lips too -
          their ritual caress.

          POV MAN - the BOY is kneeling beside him, watching him 
          calmly, no longer sweating and shivering, recovered. 

<b>          BOY.

          The MAN rouses himself, sits up and just stares at the BOY,

           thirstily. The MAN reaches out and strokes the BOY's hair as

          They are down by the water. Small pleasure boats are half
          sunken in the grey water. Faded colored bunting and painted
          signs advertise ICE CREAMS, FOOD and a FUN FAIR. The BOY
          helps the man push the trolley through the sand until they 
          can go no further, they stop and drop onto the sand,
          exhausted.

</b>
          On the port side of town the MAN wheels the trolley through
          the deserted docks past rotten piers, a row of empty wooden
          warehouses and a rusty red tanker washed up. He is COUGHING
          and the sound echoes off the warehouse walls. The BOY is
          trailing a few paces behind, they're not speaking now.

<b>          EXT. BACK STREET - EVENING
</b>
          As they pass the last of a row of deserted warehouses the MAN
          slows down to let the BOY catch up. But the BOY is now
          studying the ground intently. He bends down and picks up:
          POV BOY - an old cardboard match box, it's decals faded. He
          pushes the match box open to reveal a perfectly preserved
          Beetle. 

<b>          BOY.
</b>          What is it?

<b>          MAN.
</b>          It's a Beetle. 
          Suddenly the beetle twitches, then activates its wings and
          flies out of the box with a BUZZ and upwards into the sky...
          The BOY and the MAN stare up at the flying creature, amazed

<b>                         AND:
</b>          Without warning something WHISTLES over their heads very
          close and hits the wall beside them with a loud CLATTER. The
          MAN lunges at the BOY, landing on top of him to cover him and
          tries to grab the trolley which tips over, spilling 
          everything out.
          The MAN desperately tries to take cover while he looks over
          his shoulder and sees:
          POV MAN - in the upper window of a warehouse a man is drawing
          a bow and arrow aimed right at them.
          In desperation the MAN covers the BOY and tries to scrabble
          away but there's a DULL TWANG of bowstring and an arrow THUDS
          into his leg.

          and scrabbles around for the pistol but it has fallen from
          his belt onto the cobbles and scattered out of reach. He
          spots the flare gun and seizes it, resting it on the trolley 
          and aiming carefully at the empty window. When the lone
          ARCHER appears again he squeezes off a shot and the flare
          goes rocketing up towards the window in a firey arc, ablaze
          with color, clean through the window. They can hear the
          ARCHER SCREAMING inside and see the colored light still
          flaring from the window.

<b>          BOY.
</b>          Oh Papa!

          He bursts into the main room and trains the gun. At the far
          end a WOMAN is sitting with the prone form of the ARCHER. The
          floor is burnt in a huge patch left by the flare and is still
          in flames.

          looks sick and thin and desperate. He looks at the ARCHER,
          lying there dead, his chest and one arm and his face burnt,
          still smoking. The WOMAN covers his face with the blanket and
          the MAN doesn't know what to say, ashamed. He goes.

           POV - again from a distance, as if a third party is watching,
           we watch the BOY and the MAN hobble into a CAFE. 

<b>          INT. CAFE - DAY 
</b>
          One wall of the CAFE is merely a pile of rubble, opening out
          to the sea. The opposite wall is a photographic mural of lush
          green woods. The MAN tries to pull the arrow out but just
          pulls the wooden stem out. He takes off his bloodied trousers
          and examines the gaping wound with a flap of flesh and the
          arrow head, made from a SPOON, buried inside.

<b>          MAN.
</b>          See if you can find the medical kit
          from the boat. Quickly.
          The BOY rummages in the trolley, finds the kit and hands it
          over. He stares as the MAN slowly extracts the spoon, wincing
          in agony. The MAN dowses the wound in antiseptic from the kit
          and searches through the kit for a needle. He finds a suture
          needle in a sterile envelope, rips it open with his teeth
          and, using the light coming in through the parlour windows he
          threads some silk thread into the needle. He starts to suture
          up the wound, grimacing in pain as the BOY watches in
          silence, until eventually offering:

<b>                         BOY
</b>          Does it hurt?
          The MAN just looks at him in disbelief - beat.

          The MAN pulls the trolley slowly, finding it a great effort.
          The BOY helps pull, eying the MAN with concern. The MAN stops
          and rests on the trolley and the BOY pulls on a few more feet
          then stops and looks back as the MAN COUGHS for a long
          painful moment. He takes the bloodstained surgical mask from
          his face, his breath foggy in the cold, he wrings out the
          blood and saliva, puts his head between his knees and coughs
          until he can cough no more, gasping for breathe, bloody drool
          unspooling from his lips into the sand like scarlet twine

          They are trudging along a concrete boat ramp by the beach
          road, the beach below, the BOY carrying a small-suitcase now,
          the MAN carrying sacks and bags. They stop and the MAN leans,
          impossibly breathless, his lungs packing up. They stop at the
          water edge, where the road reaches the sea.
          The BOY takes his hand gently.

<b>          BOY.

          The MAN can't answer for breathlessness.

</b>          Well, what are we?
          The MAN sits heavily on the ground, totters as the BOY stands 
          watching him, eyes welling with tears.

          spreads out blankets.

          together in the early morning sun light. The MAN wakes and
          looks at his sleeping wife, smooths her hair tenderly, very
          much in love, as she sleeps.
           His hand on her wakes her, she looks at him surprised and

          and flap its flippers. And we were
          in that house we used to live in

          red ski parka with the hood up appears carrying a shotgun
          over his shoulder and a belt of shells.
          He goes over to the BOY, he is the same bearded and scarred 
          man seen earlier, watching them in the sand dunes. The BOY 
          doesn't flinch, but his hand goes to the gun at his side.
          When the man speaks he has some sort of speech defect,
          possibly caused by missing teeth.

</b>          Okay.

<b>          BOY.
</b>          What about my papa?

<b>          VETERAN.
</b>          There's nothing else to be done.

<b>          BOY.
</b>          I think I want to say goodbye to
          him.

<b>          VETERAN.
</b>          Will you be all right?

<b>          BOY.
</b>          Yes.

<b>          VETERAN.
</b>          Go ahead. I'll wait here for you.
          The BOY turns around and heads down to the beach.

<b>          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) - DAY
</b>
          The BOY trudges through the sand over to the corpse of the
          MAN which is now neatly wrapped up in a blanket from head to
          toe. The BOY kneels beside him and starts to cry silently and
          whisper.

<b>          BOY.
</b>          I'll talk to you every day. And I
          won't forget. No matter what. No
          matter what, Papa.
          The BOY dries his eyes, takes a breath, gets up and walks
          back to the road...

</b>
          As the BOY walks out of the dunes holding the gun, a MOTHERLY
          WOMAN who is standing with the VETERAN comes towards him.

<b>          MOTHERLY WOMAN.
</b>          Oh. I am so glad to see you.
          The BOY just stares at her, bemused - a short distance away
          stands the rest of the family - a BOY his age and a GIRL. The
          BOY stares at the OTHER BOY and recognizes him - it's the
          same BOY he chased earlier.

</b>          Then the BOY notices a threadbare mongrel of a DOG, waiting
          with them.
          The MOTHERLY WOMAN goes over and puts her arms around him.

<b>          MOTHERLY WOMAN. (CONT'D)
</b>          We've been following you. Did you
          know that? We saw you with your
          Papa and we tried to catch up but
          you were too quick for us.

<b>          VETERAN.
</b>          There was some discussion about
          whether to even come after you at
          all.

          As she's chatting, the MOTHERLY WOMAN gently takes the gun
          from the BOY and hands it to the VETERAN.

<b>          MOTHERLY WOMAN.
</b>          We're so lucky. We were so worried
          about you. And now we don't have to
          worry about a thing.
          She kisses the BOY on the forehead and holds him at arm's
          length and looks at him.

<b>          MOTHERLY WOMAN. (CONT'D)
</b>          How does that sound? Is that okay?
          He stares but says nothing...
