    A tall, handsome man in a dark suit emerges from a Lincoln

    Bumpy Johnson, an elderly but still sturdy black man,
    elegantly dressed - cashmere overcoat, gloves, Homburg -
    stands in falling snow atop a flatbed truck - as he does
    every Thanksgiving - tossing down turkeys to the poor -
    like a benign king.

    Legend:   Harlem

    A younger man, the gunman from the club - Frank Lucas -
    Bumpy's driver/bodyguard/collector/protege - watches from

    Whispering gunfire from a television set veiled by
    foreground snow: Soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam in
    1970. A rich, cultured, authoritative voice offers:
<b>                            BUMPY O/S
</b>               This is the problem. This is what's
               wrong with America.

    The war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with
    price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window.

    People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let
    Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass.

                 Where's the personal service? Does
                 anybody work here?

    Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to
    stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display
    window full of Japanese stereo componentry.

</b>                 What right do they have cutting out the

                 Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks -
                 putting Americans out of work?

    He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer.

<b>                              BUMPY
</b>                 What am I supposed to do with a place
                 like this, Frank? Who am I supposed to

                        (pause)
                 This is the problem. This is the way it
                 is now: You can't find the heart of
                 anything to stick the knife.

    Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in.
    They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he
    sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down.

<b>                               FRANK
</b>                 What is it?

    Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused.
<b>                              FRANK
</b>                 Somebody call an ambulance!

    But the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the
    emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash
    registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of.
    Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly -

<b>                              BUMPY
</b>                 Forget it, Frank. No one's in charge.

    Limousines from the funeral disgorge mourners: family,

    through the enormous crowd that has gathered to watch. FBI
    agents in cars snap pictures with long lenses of Italian

    A white Bentley pulls up, disgorging Jackie Fox - the
    original Superfly - and his entourage. With his trademark
    tinted Gucci glasses on, he happily poses for anyone with a
    camera - including the Feds - before going inside.

    The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here:
    a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem
    gangster, Robin Hood and killer.

<b>                              REPORTER ON TV
</b>                 He was a Great Man, according to the
                 eulogies. A giving man. A man of the
                 people. No one chose to include in their
                 remembrances the word most often
                 associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson:
                 Gangster.

    Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment,
    heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners
    circling the place like vultures:

    Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and
    tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present
    coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian
    capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar.

<b>                              TOSCA
</b>                 White wine, please.

    A white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down
    next to Frank.

    Frank doesn't say. It feels unseemly to him to be talking
    about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery
    glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.

<b>                              BANKER
</b>                 Bumpy set something up for you?

    Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where
    Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.

<b>                              TANGO
</b>                 Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while
                 you're at it.

    Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his
    jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. He
    takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens
    a drawer and removes an ashtray. He holds it out to Tango -
    who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.

</b>                 I know you're hurting, Frank.    So am I.

    Frank sits back down with Charlie Williams, an older dope
    man.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                 You going to be all right?

<b>                             FRANK
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                 I'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he
                 made me promise, anything ever happened
                 to him, I'd make sure you didn't go
                 without.

<b>                              FRANK
</b>                 I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people
                 here owed Bumpy money when he died. A
                 lot of money. If they think I'm going
                 to forget to collect, they're wrong.

<b>                              CHARLIE
</b>                 That's the spirit. Go get them.

    On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime
    figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered
    that Bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..."

    The door opens the length of a chain, revealing a wise guy
    in an undershirt, who, when he sees the subpoena, start to               
    close the door -

     Rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one

     Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of

     As a police captain counts the stacks of money, Lou Toback,
     Richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his
     night out interrupted by this emergency. He crossed to where
     Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner. Quietly:                    

<b>                            TOBACK
</b>               How much.

</b>               What happened to the rest?

     It's a joke but isn't funny, not even to Toback. He regards
     his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place -
     who are watching them and the money being counted. Toback
     walks over to the captain, and, quietly:

     As Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him -
     knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect,
     but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted. Neither will           
     ever be trusted again. He climbs into his car, drives off.

     Tango and his bodyguard come in and approach Frank's table
     where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast.

     Frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't
     full. He swallows finally, but then only reaches for his
     coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating Tango.

     clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a
     $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of Tango.

        The clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on R&R
        and Asian women. A trio of ex-GI's plays authentic Southern
        blues on a small stage. Ham hocks and collard greens come
        out of the kitchen. Smoke chokes the place.

        Frank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or
        stoned, sits alone at a table with a Coca-Cola and surveys
        the activity: Dope being rolled. Dope being smoked. Dope
        being shot. GI's and prostitutes climbing a staircase.

        His eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the
        tables as if checking on the GI's well being. But at some,
        his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder.

        The Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching
        Frank watching him from across the room. He squints through
        the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in
        a kind of shock, more to himself -

      the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark
      30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago
      torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument.

      He parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past
      an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive
      heat. It's riot weather.

      Richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like
      it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at
      the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance.

      The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney:
      tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they

        Rivera suddenly tries to get tough -

                     make that kind of accusation against your

        He takes out his car keys, turns to leave. Comes past                   
        Richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a            
        line of puncture scabs and scars.

                     Same as you. No one.

        Richie squeezes Rivera's hand around the car key.

                     kill you.

        Richie squeezes Sander's hand so hard the car key cuts
        through the skin, drawing blood.

</b>        Silence. Marshland. A beat-up Chevy parked alongside a
        perimeter fence. Frank waits by the car as a military Jeep
        with its lights out comes across a firing range. It slows,
        stops. In it, the silhouettes of three servicemen, black,
        armed with M-16's. Silence again, before:

<b>                                  ARMY CAPTAIN
</b>                     Open the trunk.

        Frank does it, then stands aside as the other servicemen
        drag four large taped-up duffel bags from the Jeep to his
        car, lift them into his trunk and slam it shut.

<b>71      INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                           71

        The duffel bags, still closed, on a table. Frank regards
        them, nursing a drink, putting off the moment of discovery
        that he has perhaps spent his life's savings on nothing.

      The German shepherd watches as Frank removes the tape from
      one of the bags. He pulls it open - has almost no reaction -
      except to breathe again - then opens the next, and the next.

      And we see: Several brick-like packages of No. 4 heroin
      wrapped in paper marked with Chinese writing, stamped with
      a label: two lions on their hind legs, paws on a globe,
      and, in English: DOUBLE UOGLOBE BRAND 100%.

      The duffel bags are elsewhere. The only evidence of any
      drugs is the small amount Frank has given a chemist - who
      looks like a Harvard student - to test. It responds                     
      instantly. The young man looks at Frank.

                   like this. No alkaloids, no adulterants,

      The chemist opens a leather travel syringe kit to shoot up,             
      but Frank gives him some to take home instead.

      The chemist gathers his things to leave, offering a last                
      piece of advice -

      A clapboard house set down on a piece of land that was
      probably once worked by sharecroppers. An elderly woman
      framed in a lit kitchen window, doing dishes.

      Dark yew trees and scavenged, discarded cars and car parts
      like patches of rusty snow. Crickets and bullfrogs. From a
      mound of dirt, a young man hurls a baseball to another with
      a catcher's mitt exactly sixty feet away. The kid's got a
      major league arm.

      his early 30's works on a stock car.

     Frank and the dog in the back yard of a suburban house.
     His neighbors - those he can see - are white. He hears a
     sound - cars arriving - and crosses toward the house where
     a sold "For Sale" sign leans against a half-built kennel.

     Out front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - North
     Carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just
     arrived. Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here,
     the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives
     and kids, and their mother.

     Teddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as
     sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar
     parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for
     trespassing.
     The front door opens and Frank comes out, trailed by his
     dog. He first gathers his mother in an embrace, then each
     of his startled brothers.

     The house is alive with the noise of family and scent of
     home-cooked food as the extended Lucas clan - there's more
     than twenty of them - sits around a big dining room table
     passing the platters around. Frank, at the head of the
     table, clearly loves having them all here.

     year-old boy seen pitching in the North Carolina back yard -
     tries to shrug.

     that was parked at the Teaneck house, driven by Frank's body-

     Before the last word is out of Tango's mouth, Frank's got a
     gun pressed against his forehead. Silence. Everyone backs
     away - the bodyguard, too. Tango's girl pulls her arm from
     his and takes off. Eventually -

     It's as if life on the street has stopped. No one moves;
     everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants.
     As Tango laughs at the thought -

<b>                               FRANK
</b>                  Yeah, that's right.

     Frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like
     someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties
     the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street.

     Then it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but
     Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's
     suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops
     it in the "jar" and sets it next to the body.

     Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the
     astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the
     place. Tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he
     tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar.

     Joe bows graciously, gives a little wave to the crowd, and
     sits back down as the band starts up again.

     At another table, Frank sits with Charlie Williams and
     Rossi, slightly older dope men. Like Frank, they favor
     expensive tailored suits. Their dates, too, are nicely
     dressed - not too much make-up or jewelry. Frank's glance
     moves from Joe Louis and his wife to a beautiful young woman
     at the table.

     adjusts his hat. Frank tries to explain to him:

     celebrity like Joe Louis asking to borrow money, but nods.

     entourage. Frank watches him make the rounds, lingering at
     Miss Puerto Rico's table and holding her hand longer than he
     should with his girlfriend on his arm. Frank glances to
     Teddy wearily, then to Doc, alone at the next table like a

      The cop pretends to arrest them all, but what he doesn't
      pretend is the hand he puts on Jimmy's girlfriend's breast
      as he frisks her.

<b>                                JIMMY
</b>                   What is that?

      It was quick but Jimmy saw it, even though his girlfriend
      didn't react. The cop, oblivious, is cuffing Teddy now.

      The room explodes with a boom and the detective crumples to
      the floor, clutching at his leg, blood running through his
      fingers onto the carpet. Frank stares.

      As Spearman follows the truck, the George Washington Bridge,

      The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue
      grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car
      stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on.

      Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is
      talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to
      go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the
      block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the
      restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who
      has to double back quickly not to be seen

      Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading
      crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck
      on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck.
      Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries               
      over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.

      The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and
      tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets
      his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags
      the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in.

      He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic,
      screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead
      - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his
      mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding -

      The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another
      red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple
      car-lengths ahead - in sight.

      From around a corner, striding toward him, come four men
      looking like Gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair -
      the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as
      they enter the restaurant.

      Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy
      basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst
      in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on
      the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in
      a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to
      protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol.

      Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but
      take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride
      out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they

</b>                   Monopolies are illegal in this country,
                   Frank, because no one can compete with a
                   monopoly. If they let the dairy farmers
                   do that, half of them would go out of

                   as enlightened. Ask them, What is civil
                   rights, they don't know. They're not as
                   open to change from the way things are

                   to them so there won't be any
                   misunderstanding. That's what I mean by
                   peace of mind.

      Frank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in
      this matter. Still, maybe it's not so bad.

<b>                                FRANK

                   as you want.
      Tosca slips on his best poker face. Fifty thousand a kilo
      would be an extraordinary coup for him.

      A TV: Muhammad Ali, the black man's black man, and Joe
      Frazier, the white man's black man, at their 1971 Madison
      Square Garden press conference where Ali says as much.

      Most of the guys watching it. Richie isn't. He comes
      over to Table of Organization. Tacks his Bar Association
      notice to it. Regards the photographs, like tentacles of
      octopus yet to have a head.

      Only the lowest section is made up of blacks (including
      Charlie Williams and Jackie Fox, but not Frank Lucas). The
      rest of the faces are white and stop about midway up.

      the first early fans arrive, pointing out that the fight,

      Frank chooses a linen jacket from his extensive color-

      lingerie, puts on make-up at a vanity. He comes up behind

           side of the closet, lays it on the bed next to Frank's suit
           jacket. She takes hold of the zipper but doesn't
           immediately pull it, hoping perhaps to create some dramatic

      than all the Italians'. Detective Trupo notices this, too.
      Richie focuses on the Chincilla's date, a stunning girl, a
      beauty queen, then shifts back to her boyfriend who's now
      shaking the proffered hands of other Italians, then Don
      King. Joe Louis himself - who barely acknowledged Richie's                
      existence - comes over and playfully exchanges "punches"                  
      with the man in the chinchilla coat.

      Richie tries to find the guy in the chinchilla coat, but
      he's hidden by a flag. Then he glimpses him again just as
      Ali shakes his hand before climbing into the ring -

      Flashbulbs pop throughout the arena as Robert Goulet
      begins the National Anthem. Ali pointedly doesn't sing
      along. Richie frames the shadowy figure in the chinchilla

      some men in bloody white coats.

</b>                Brand names mean something, Jackie.
                Consumers rely on them to know what
                they're getting. They know the company
                isn't going to try to fool them with an
                inferior product. They buy a Ford, they
                know they're gonna get a Ford.

      he expects to get hit. The SIU detectives arrive.

      Trupo reaches in the driver's side window, takes the keys
      from the ignition and comes around to the trunk. Frank and
      Teddy exchange a glance as it opens. Silence. Then -
<b>                             TRUPO

      Six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light.
      Frank and Trupo regard it in silence. Then -

                   leaving the big guy alone? You know who

      What Richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at
      this point he's got a problem.

      Ana hangs tinsel on the tree as Frank gives the shepherd
      some dog toy presents he's bought. More to himself:

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                   Bumpy hardly ever went out at a certain
                   point. He stayed in - read - watched TV -
                   played chess. I thought he chose to lead
                   a quiet life. He didn't. He couldn't go
                   out without something happening.

<b>                                ANA
</b>                   We can still go out.

</b>                   Where? With who? Everyone I know is
                   under surveillance. I can't even be with
                   my family at Christmas anymore.

      He gets up, pets the dog, and looks out the window at
      Christmas angels stretched across the street, at people on
      the sidewalk, wondering perhaps which of them are undercover
      cops, at Trupo's car, still parked outside.

                   doesn't matter. It doesn't satisfy them.

                    The French Connection, Fernando Rey, the
                    exporters Frank has put out of business.
                    Now, I can take care of him in New York,
                    but I don't want to have to worry every
                    time he drives across the bridge to
                    Jersey someone's gonna take another shot
                    at him.

       Richie gives nothing away even as it stuns him that Trupo
       would speak to him this blatantly.

                    their aim could be better. We need to
                    keep this cash cow alive.

       Jimmy Racine comes in - sees Trupo - and leaves - but not
       before Trupo has seen him. And now he sees the Lucas Table
       of Organization he didn't notice when he came in. Gets up
       and walks over to it now and takes a closer look. Sees
       Frank's picture at the top, like Enemy Number 1.

       dive for cover, shouting "Vietcong," and returning the fire.
       Frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots
       into the trees. Bullet-severed palm fronds rain down.

       Nate cuts the mule-train tether in the middle, slaps at the
       animals. As the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees
       the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. Smoke from
       all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen Thais
       and Americans lying dead on the ground.

<b>                             US ATTORNEY
</b>                That was a military transport plane. If
                there was heroin on board then someone in
                the military would have to be involved.
                Which means that even as it fights a war
                that's claimed 50,000 Americans lives,
                the military is smuggling narcotics.

                Army is in the drug trafficking business -
                and is trying to prove it by desecrating
                the remains of young men who've given

       sound fades.

       Half the apartment doors are gone. TVs and radios echo,
       voices argue, infants wail. The detectives come around a
       corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a
       sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door.

       They step back. Consider one other. Spearman volunteers
       with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. He walks
       up to the guys with the guns.

                   with Teddy and it's none of your fuckin
                   business except to knock on the fuckin
                   door and get him.

      As the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, Spearman yanks it
      hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the
      floor. The shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets.
      Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as
      Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door -

      The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy,
      panicked, runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in
      yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere
      inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back -
      crawling across the floor like an infantrymen -

      Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his
      pistol. But Teddy's gone. He sees a tapestry of a tiger on
      a wall. Pulls at it, finds a big hole knocked into another
      dark apartment, climbs through, sees an open door -

      As Richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls
      echoing in the stairwell. He starts down, taking the stairs
      five at a time, chases Teddy down two flights -                      

      Teddy yanks open a door, runs down a corridor, bangs into            
      an apartment. Richie reaches the apartment just as Teddy is          
      goes out onto an exterior balcony -                                  
      Richie continues along the interior corridor, running                
      parallel to Teddy on the balcony, who trips over some debris         
      and garbage, looking over his shoulder for Richie -                  

      Richie cuts through another apartment to head him off, but           
      the door to the balcony is nailed shut. So are the windows.          
      Richie looks around, grabs a small portable television and,          
      just as Teddy runs past, hurls it through a window at him,           
      hitting him in the head.                                             

      He falls hard, dazed. Richie hurries through the broken              
      window. Teddy comes to and fights back, until Richie breaks          
      his femur with his bare hands. Teddy howls in excruciating
      pain -

       Frank, on a wooden folding chair at Bumpy's grave, hears
       the gunning of engines and barking of cops. He turns to see
       Doc being handcuffed on the ground by the Towncar. Glances
       to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise. Richie.

       Richie arrives at the grave. Regards the monument to
       Ellsworth Johnson, and Frank sitting calmly regarding him.
       Richie glances around the peaceful surroundings ...

       in the mirror. Under the fluorescent lights - maybe under             
       any kind - his skin is a shade of death. He splashes water

      The courtroom doors swing open and Richie sees Frank Lucas,
      in a tailored suit, escorted in without cuffs by an amiable-           
      looking federal marshal.

      As Frank moves through the gallery, Richie sees it's full of
      the gangster's friends, many of them celebrities, who smile
      and greet and fawn as if the Pope has arrived.

      Richie has evidence tables covered with cash, weapons,
      stocks, bonds, property deeds, pictures of Frank's holdings,
      heroin in blue cellophane.

      Frank has celebrities, community leaders, Joe Louis himself
      who will testify to Frank's benevolent character. The Champ
      hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and
      Richie wonders if he should just give up now.

      Richie sees it in slow motion: the hands reaching out to
      Frank, the pats on his back, lipsticked mouths of beautiful
      women offering kisses and words of encouragement, his old
      mother giving him a hug.

      He watches Frank's head turn slowly, his eyes passing his
      phalanx of attorneys, the jury, finally settling on Richie
      in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table.

      Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask,
      Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - can
      you see how insignificant you are?                                     

      Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally, Frank                  
      brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within            
      the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team.

      Richie slowly lifts himself from his chair, steps forward,             
      turns to look at the jury that's studying him, finally finds           
      his voice:

      The attorneys get up and leave. Richie takes their place.
      Frank regards him a moment, offering the same knowing smile
      from the courtroom. Richie offers nothing.

<b>                                FRANK

                   in the trunk of a car, did you?

      Richie doesn't say. Frank searches his face for some clue
      to where on earth he's from.

                   The question is would you do it again?
                   That was a long time ago. It'd be very

      Frank gathers his few personal belongings and puts them in
      a box. Stands with the box and waits for the cell door to
      open. The Table of Organization and files are gone.

      Legend:   Frank Lucas was convicted of Conspiracy to
                Distribute Narcotics and sentenced to 70 years.
                He served 15 of them.

      Legend:   Federal authorities confiscated over 250 million
                dollars from him in real estate, equities and cash
                in US and foreign banks.

      Richie, too, is packing, putting personal items into boxes.

      Legend:   The day after he convicted Frank Lucas and 30 of
                his Country Boy relatives, Richard Roberts borrowed
                $400 from his credit union to help pay for a 3-day
                vacation to the Bahamas.

      Richie, carrying the box, switches off the lights and closes
      the door behind him on his way out.

      Legend:   Six months later, he quit the Prosecutors Office
                to become a defense attorney. His first client was
                Frank Lucas.

      Frank steps out into sunlight, free but owning nothing but
      the cardboard box in his arms. Looks out across the parking
      lot to see if anyone has come to pick him up. Sees Richie
      by his car, hand raised above his head like a flag.

      The two of them stand outside Richie's car on the same
      corner Frank shot Tango. Frank looks up at the street signs
      that used to say 116th Street and 8th Avenue. Now they say
      116th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

<b>                              FRANK

      He considers the street itself. It too has changed. The
      corner groceries, as Bumpy prophesied, really are gone now.

      pants, bandanas tied around their heads.

      Frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one
      of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter. The
      gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do
      something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on
      Frank's face, thinks better of it. The others stop.
