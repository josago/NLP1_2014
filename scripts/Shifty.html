<b>1   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING
</b>
    A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer,
    makes its way along a stretch of motorway.


<b>2   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING
</b>
    At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes
    closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the
    bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He
    pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play
    on his MP3.


<b>3   INT. COACH. MORNING
</b>
    Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff
    face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera,
    Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music
    from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day",
    a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and
    comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye.

    The track will play over the following opening scenes, the
    credits fading subtly in and out in white text.


<b>4   EXT. STREET. MORNING
</b>
    We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent
    through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to
    house the east end after the Second World War.

<b>                                                      CUT TO:
</b>
    We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through
    those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up.

<b>                            SHIFTY
</b>
    Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a
    fence, making a short cut.


<b>5   INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING
</b>
    Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset,
    pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water,
    holding his nose.

<b>6    INT. COACH. MORNING.
</b>
     Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on
     his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just
     catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN.


<b>7    INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING
</b>
     Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of
     cocaine onto a clean glass table.


<b>8    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
</b>
     Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white
     dressing gown, prepares breakfast.


<b>9    EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING
</b>
     Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping
     over a fence at the end.


<b>10   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
</b>
     Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits.


<b>11   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING
</b>
     In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He
     climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real
     enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation.


<b>12   INT. COACH. MORNING
</b>
     Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same
     strip of waste land Shifty just walked across.


<b>13   GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING
</b>
     Glen splits the cocaine into two piles.


<b>14   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. MORNING
</b>
     Trevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His
     mind is racing, thinking about the morning ahead of him.

     Jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water.


<b>16   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING
</b>
     The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his
     shoulder.

<b>     A BEAT.
</b>
     He turns and walks off.


<b>17   TREVOR'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING
</b>
     Trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror, he rubs his
     face, he seems a little more with it.


<b>18   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING
</b>
     Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one
     half of the cocaine. He mixes it carefully.


<b>19   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE / BACK GARDEN. MORNING
</b>
     Shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house.


<b>20   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. DAY
</b>
     Chris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his
     shoulder. He looks around at the old place. Soaking it in.


<b>21   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING
</b>
     Glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes
     it with citric acid. He sucks it up into a syringe.


<b>22   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE . MORNING
</b>
     Shifty quietly opens the back door to the house.


<b>23   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. MORNING
</b>
     Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad
     facial burns on the side of her face. He injects the cocaine
     mix into her arm. She lays back on the bed, taking on the
     rush.
<b>                                                           4.

<b>24   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING
</b>
     Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of
     paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He
     stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our
     soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head
     phones, walks to the door and knocks gently.


<b>25   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
</b>
     Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears
     the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts
     it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris.

<b>                         SHIFTY
</b>               Fucking hell, man...

     Shifty can't help but smile.

     A smile creeps across Chris' face.

<b>                         SHIFTY
</b>               Yes, rude boy.

<b>26   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING
</b>

<b>     CLOSE ON: WATER GUSHES FROM A TAP.
</b>
     Chris stands splashing his face from the sink. His bag
     perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror.
<b>                                                           5.

<b>27   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / SHIFTY'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING
</b>
     Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and
     pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New
     DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's,
     lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side,
     books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked
     pile of mobile phone bills with the word "PAID" scribed
     across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of
     Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning
     sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He
     stands, staring.


<b>28   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
</b>
     Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast
     ready. Shifty turns to face him.

<b>                         SHIFTY

</b>               In case of emergency's, man... you
               know it.

     They both laugh. Shifty lays sausages into a pan.

Chris laughs.

          bruv.

Shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan.

</b>          Fucking random.

Shifty covers the sausages with a lid. We hear someone moving
about upstairs. Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer,
opens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large
bag of sweet corn.

<b>                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
</b>          I've got a few things to do today
          geezer, you can stay here if you
          want, just chill out.

He rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out
tightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack. He places
them in the pockets of his hooded top. Chris watches Shifty
closely, but doesn't say anything.

<b>29   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / STAIRWELL / KITCHEN. MORNING

     We follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and
     walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old
     boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth
     Vader into passing stools. Katie a three year old baby girl
     eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst
     talking on the phone.

     Shifty's brother, walks in. Mid 30's, portly. He sees Chris.

     Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and
     grabs a glass of orange juice from the side.

stare.

Chris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw
nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the
ice by talking about a more trivial topic.

               discreetly, but he lunged her from

     Bob's hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob
     turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment
     then turns and walks away. Trevor's face is awash with

     Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the

     Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before
     Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what
     he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small
     yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a
     smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments
     falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie
     walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully

      hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty
      peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway -
      a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the
      hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal
      a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays
      out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old,
      Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the
      films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty,
      cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to
      the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just
      staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed.
      Shifty stares him out.

     At that precise moment a plain clothes police car comes
     heading toward them. The siren blares out. Chris and Shifty,
     caught between a rock and a hard place, turn and sprint.

     Chris runs, suddenly Shifty overtakes. Chris is fast but
     Shifty's like a whippet.

     Malik's legging it down an alleyway, he throws the bag over a
     wall and goes over after it, he vaults, landing knee deep in
     a shitty garden pond.

</b>               This is bollocks.

     Shifty vaults a brick wall, Chris follows. The drop on the
     other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor
     hard. Suddenly they see something that grabs their attention.


<b>87   EXT. CYCLE TRACK. DAY
</b>
     Shifty and Chris come swerving around the corner on the
     crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen. Shifty's knees are
     near his chin, and Chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag
     whipping off the back.

     It's not perfect but it's better than running. Shifty starts
     cracking up laughing. Chris' face looks a little more
     serious, however. He doesn't find this all quite as funny as
     Shifty.

     is stood up, leaning on his knees, breathing hard.

     out a pack of fags.

      Shifty stands at the river side. Chris beyond, watching.
      Shifty reaches into his jacket and pulls out the .38
      revolver. He throws it into the river.

</b>
      The bus pulls away. Chris settles back, and offers Shifty one
      of his head phones to share. Shifty takes it and sits back,
      looking out the window. The track we heard at the beginning
      of the film begins to play: Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day". It
      plays softly over the following scenes.

      CAMCORDER: Jasmine peers into the lens. She then turns the
      camera and follows Trevor who plants himself on the other
      settee, he looks uneasy.

<b>                          TREVOR
</b>                Babe, do me a favour.

      There is a colossal banging sound.

<b>                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>                What the fuc...

      Trevor's up on his feet. The banging becomes a crash as
      something gives way.

      Three heavyset men in balaclava's charge into the front room.
      Jasmine screams, dropping the camera on its side yet still
      giving a viewpoint on events. Three men are on Trevor, he's
      receiving a serious beating.

<b>      THE MUSIC ON THE SOUND TRACK BEGINS TO GET LOUDER.
</b>
      A man grabs Jasmine by the hair and drags her to the middle
      of the room, she attempts to fight back, feisty as ever. This
      is bedlam. Suddenly someone rushes in from the left and lays
      a vicious right hook to Trevor's head. He goes down like a
      lead weight. Jasmine's crying, fear washing over her. A child
      cries out from upstairs.

<b>                            VOICE (OS)
</b>                Tell that fucking slag to stop
                crying... NOW!!

      Two hooded men drag Jasmine off to another room. She's
      fighting back clawing at them. Trevor's face is pressed
      against the cold lino flooring. Someone has grabbed the
      camera and angles it on Trevor's bloodied features. Congealed
      blood envelopes his eyes and nose cavities.

</b>
      A hand moves into shot and grabs hold of his face, squeezing
      his cheeks so he looks sadly comic. Trevor's eyes flicker
      open.

      Trevor fails to comply. The hand slaps him hard and grabs his
      face again.
