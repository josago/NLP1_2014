<b>          INT. FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING
</b>

<b>          
</b>          Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS.
          BERRY. The word "Work" is on the blackboard.

<b>                                MS. BERRY
</b>                    "Work." Today we're going to

          QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside
          their desks, addressing the class:

                        A liar? I don't think you
                        mean "a liar."

              Max shrugs.

<b>              INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY
</b>

<b>          
</b>              FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
              manner is utterly genuine and convincing.

<b>                                  FLETCHER
</b>                        A dark street. . . a stormy
                        night... two desperate men
                        struggle... one man is taken
                        to the hospital, the other to
                        ja il. The prosecutor wants
                        you to believe this is an
                        open-and-shut case of a poor
                        man, brutally victimized.
              He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.

<b>                                  FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                        Well, for once I agree with
                        t he prosecutor. This is an
                        open-and shut case -- but the
                        true victim is my client.
              Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.

<b>                                  FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                        Put yourself in his shoes for
                        a moment--walking home from
                        church, alone, in a
                        frightening part of the
                        suburbs.
              As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM

<b>              OUT:
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                    You're nervous, timid, looking
                    over your shoulder -- when
                    suddenly, you encounter him--
                          (pointing at the
                           old man)
                    pouncing from the shadows.
                    You quiver in fear. The
                    streetlight flashes on
                    something shiny in his hand--
                    a knife?

          Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
          weapon. The jurors RECOIL.

<b>                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>                    And in that terrifying instant
                    you do what any respectable
                    citizen would -- you defend
                    y ou rse lf. Only after you
                    shatter his arm and collarbone
                    do you realize it's all a
                    mistake... the man was merely
                    walking away from an ATM
                    machine, the apparent flash of
                    metal caused by his bank card.
          He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.

<b>                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                           (CONCERNED)
</b>                    As you stand over his
                    crumpled, though potentially
                    still-dangerous form, your
                    he art goes out to him. You
                    want to help. First, you
                    gather up the many bills he
                    dropped, to stop them from
                    bl owi ng away. Second, in an
                    effort to get the name and
                    number of someone to notify,
                    you take his wallet. Finally,
                    you leap into the man's Lexus
                    to head for assistance, when
                    suddenly a police car speeds
                    up. You breathe a sigh of
                    relief: "Someone to look -after
                    the injured man! Oh joy!"
                    But do the police applaud your
                    initiative? Do they hail your
                    heroism? No-- they arrest you
                    and throw you in the slammer!
          He walks along the jury box:

                   a society -- persecuting
                   people because they're large?
          Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.

</b>                      Nothing. I just nailed my

          Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.

<b>                              AUDREY

          Max doesn't respond.

<b>                              AUDREY (CONT'D)

                    anything-- whatever you want
                    most in the world.
          When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..

<b>                              AUDREY (CONT'D)
</b>                    Max, your dad is sorry. He

          Max doesn't believe it.     <
          He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   In
          VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.

<b>                               MAX (V.O.)

                    couldn't tell a lie.
          He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A
          strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up,
          up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.

<b>          
</b>          PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is
          adorned with Fletcher's shoes...
          To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...
          To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing...
          To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to
          Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--

<b>                                MIRANDA
</b>                    S o . . . was it good for you?
          Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing
          way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.

<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>                    I've had better.
          Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing
          compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.

<b>          INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>

<b>          
</b>          The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully
          kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF
          CLOTHES follow.
          The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.
          A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her
          broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING

<b>          
</b>          An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With
          regret and wonder he remembers:

<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>                    "I've had better?"

<b>          
</b>          Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in
          the mirror, mouth foaming.

<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>                    "I've had better?!"

<b>          INT. HALLWAY OF FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator.

<b>                               FLETCHER

                    "I've had better?"
          I t arrives. He steps in.

<b>          INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MORNING
</b>
          The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a
          beautiful young WOMAN.

<b>                              FLETCHER

</b>                    No. Just the ones I want to
                    bang like a drum.
          Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...

<b>          INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
</b>
          We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door
          opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps
          out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.

<b>          EXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING

          A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he
          is accosted by a BEGGAR.

<b>                              BEGGAR

          But he continues walking.

<b>                              BEGGAR
</b>                    Could you spare some?

</b>
<b>                               FLETCHER
</b>                    Unquestionably.
          Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered
          truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.

<b>                                BEGGAR
</b>                    Will you?

<b>                                FLETCHER
</b>                   Because I resent your

                   unpleasant mixture of disgust
                   and guilt. Further, I don't
                   believe you'll use the money
                   for food, but I believe you'll
                   use it for, at worst, drugs,
                   or, at best, whiskey, or
                 . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.
          As Fletcher heads up the stairs...

<b>          
</b>          A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,

          wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters
          with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.

<b>                              DANA

<b>                                DANA

<b>                               FLETCHER
</b>                    Our case is simply this. . .
          Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T
          GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but
          succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.

                    your track record, I expected
                    a little more.
          Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
          the brief.

<b>                                FLETCHER   ..

                   writing!
          But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished
          Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.

<b>                                DANA

</b>          He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS
          HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out.

                    objections to my client's
                    case.
          Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
          world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.

                    same ethical objections, Mr.

<b>                                JUDGE STEVENS
</b>                    I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
                    wants the substitution of
                    counsel, I'll allow it. Is
                    that what you want, Mrs. Cole?

                   Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
                   she is entitled to nothing.
                   We have in our possession an
                   audiotape made by a licensed
                   private investigator of an
                   explicit act of sexual
                   congress with a man who is not
                   her husband.

<b>                             JUDGE STEVENS
</b>                   Sounds pretty damning, Mr.

<b>                             FLETCHER
</b>                   It certainly does.

<b>                             DANA
</b>                   However, my client has no
                   desire to see his ex-wife
                   destitute. Against my advice,
                   he's willing to offer her a
                   cash settlement of.two point
                   four million dollars.

<b>                             JUDGE STEVENS
</b>                   Two four seems like a pretty
                   fair offer, Mr. Reid.

<b>                             FLETCHER
</b>                   Fantastically fair.
                   Phenominally fair. In fact,
                   I'd say beyond fair, bordering
                   on stupid.
          Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
          refreshing.

<b>                             JUDGE STEVENS
</b>                   What are you suggesting, Mr.

                   willingness to proffer such an
                   offer betrays a lack of faith

<b>                             FLETCHER

                    you make even the lamest case

                    you. Even Clarence Darrow

          Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.

                    cut a spectacularly promising
                    legal career off at the knees.

                   Fletcher. I must confess--
                   after last night's incident, I
                   was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was
                   tempted to do whatever little
                   things lie in my power to
                   scuttle your chances of making
                   partner.
          Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.

                   that 's not fair. Fletcher
                   didn't mean to insult me."

                    Preferably, with me. Whatever

          They both look to Audrey.

</b>                    All I want is for Max to be
                    happy.
          Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the
          stairs. He's still upset.

<b>                              AUDREY

          Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,

<b>          TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.
</b>
<b>                                FLETCHER/TERMINATOR

</b>                    You mad at me?
          Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:

<b>                               FLETCHER
</b>                    You wanted me to stop lying.
                    But lying isn't the problem. ..
                    Why we lie ~ that's the
                    problem. Sometimes we lie to
                    make someone else feel better.
                    But sometimes we lie because
                    the truth gets in our way...
                          (touches him)
                    But being an adult means you
                    sacrifice some things for more

<b>          
</b>                    important things. Much more
                    important things. I was so
                    stupid, Max.
                          (pointing to his
                           own head)
                    Malfunction in vector one.
                    All this time you've been here
                    and I could see you anytime I
                    felt like it. And I...
                    didn't. Please don't go to
                    Boston. Max, I love you more
                    than anything else in the
                    world and you know it's true.
                    I couldn't say it if it
                    weren't true. Not today.
          A moment as Max studies his father, then:

                    He's telling the truth, Mom.
                    He's not allowed to lie. I
                    made a wish and anything Dad
                    says has to be the truth.
                          (to Fletcher) ..
                    Right?
          But Fletcher's looking at his watch...

<b>                               FLETCHER

</b>                    Max, you made the wish at

                    for the last seven minutes.
          Max steps away from Fletcher.

<b>                              MAX
</b>                    So then, you were...

<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>                    No! It wasn't a lie. I just
                    wanted to be honest with you
                    and tell you -- there was no
                    wish to guarantee it anymore.
                    You just have to believe me.
          Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself
          Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.

                     Mommy... do we have to go to
                     Boston?
          Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.

</b>                     No.      We don't have to.
          Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll
          never let you go."

          Fletcher smiles. . .

<b>          EXT. PARK - DAY

          A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is
          seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a
          baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...

          Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He
          sees Audrey.

          He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops
          for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.

          A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the
          ball to Max.

          Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too.
          There may be better things in life... but at this moment,
          it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly.
