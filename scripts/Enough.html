          other times, they're loosely spaced or sharply angled or
          individual words flash up one after another. i.e., titles

          FLURRY OF MOVEMENT, WAITRESSES setting up for lunch, Slim
          joking with GINNY (28, knocked around but still spirited; two
          kids at home from different guys; she somehow maintains a good
          attitude). Slim views Ginny as her idol: for her attitude, not
          her life. Catch them in mid-conversation, Ginny slightly
          offended, working-class accent:

          Ginny and Slim converge carrying dirty dishes, piling them up
          for the BUSBOY, TEDDY (21, Hispanic). They haven't stopped
          moving for two hours, but now they can take a breath, survey
          the scene. Slim notices Ginny has a wet spot under her arm.

<b>                         SLIM

          (as someone comes in)
          Your turn, I'm sweatin' too much.
          Slim gives her a look, grabs a menu, goes over to where the new
          customer, whom we will call for the moment OUR HERO, is seated.

</b>          Waiting for somebody?
          He shakes his head. She can't help noticing he's very
          handsome.

</b>          Finneaan's Wake by James Joyce. A

          hardest hardest, just the hardest
          one it's actually possible to read,
          and I figure if I can get through
          that one, I can do the others.

          Ginny grins. Slim writes up a check for a CUSTOMER at the
          counter. When she finishes, the turkey burger is up.
          She carries it to the table:

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          Who's the rose for?
          He shrugs.
          She's busy, so she starts to go:

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          Enjoy your grub, huh?
          She's seven feet away when she hears:

          He smiles, offers the rose:

<b>                         OUR HERO
</b>          You.
          She smiles back-their eyes meet... a sudden utterly magical
          moment. This is also the moment to.note OUR HERO should be
          played by a famous actor doing a cameo. Because at this
          instant the scene changes.
          The man (MITCH) in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we haven't
          noticed because all we've seen is the back of his head - turns
          and looks at Slim. Stands. Looks down at Our Hero...

<b>                         MITCH

</b>          The bet. How much is it?
          Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face -

          hours, starting noon today.
          Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which
          looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger -

          He pushes again and Mitch,s hand shoots out like a snake
          striking. Grabs him by the collar. Lifts him. A frozen
          moment, more violence just a breath away, and a sense of things
          about to spin out of control... Our Hero's eyes are popping;
          he tries to hide his fear:

<b>                         OUR HERO
</b>          Take it easy, M...man. She and
          I were just having some fun -

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          (to our Hero)
          Was it two hundred or five?

<b>                         (VERY CALM)
</b>          I want to know what I'm worth.
          Our Hero gestures to Mitch: would you mind putting me down?
          Mitch reluctantly obliges.
          Our Hero does his best to recollect his dignity. Looks at
          Slim. Drops a ten on the table and smirks:

<b>                         OUR HERO
</b>          The bet was two, but now that I
          know you? Way too high.
          A pained look flashes across Slim's face -
          Our Hero starts toward the door, but Mitch steps in his path.
          Speaks quietly but with authority; there's a physical power in
          his words. Since he's protecting Slim, the power is

<b>                         COMFORTING:

</b>          Don't come back here, buddy. Ever.
          Our Hero nods nervously.
          Mitch steps back 3 inches, just far enough to let our Hero
          leave. Which he does with considerable relief.
          Slim's leaning vs. the counter, shaken, tears in her eyes -
          Mitch tugs his baseball cap, mutters as he heads for the door:

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Sorry to get in your business.

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          No. Hey. Thank you.
          He nods, keeps going.

<b>          SLIM (CONT.)
</b>          (blurts out, grateful:)
          I... I can't believe you actually
          said something.

          If I'd kept my mouth shut, I'd'a
          felt bad later.
          Good luck, huh?
          She nods.
          He ambles out the door. A touch of the cowboy in him.
          She shakes her head, looks at Ginny.
          Ginny gestures as if to say, well?
          At first Slim doesn't get it.
          Ginny gestures more urgently: Come on. What're you waiting
          for? She looks toward the door -
          Slim follows her look. PUSH IN ON SLIM'S FACE as she tries to
          work up the courage...

<b>                          FLASHES:
</b>           Wedding photos. Mitch has lots of (surprisingly upper crust)
          family, Slim has a few friends. The more photos FLASH, the
          more pronounced (and sad), the contrast. FLY RIGHT INTO:
          Bacchanalian DANCING. French Champagne has flowed; shoes and
          inhibitions were abandoned hours ago. THE CAMERA weaves
          through the DANCERS to find:
          Slim and Mitch, dancing close, never quite touching, every move
          intense, physical, like subtle public sex. Their eyes are
          locked; she runs her veil down his body, his hand lightly
          touches her ass; they slow down and stand, lips a millimeter
          apart but not quite kissing, the sexual tension building...
          We see how crazy they are about each other, how completely
          physically involved - and how much fun they have.
          Watching them is Phil, with Mitch's parents, MRS. TYLER (58,
          confident, at ease with her power and family money, and
          likeable despite monstrous flaws) and MR. TYLER (someone Mrs.
          Tyler married in a moment of cupidity).

<b>          MRS. TYLER
</b>          Mitch was kind of.. .evasive. Is her
          father dead too?

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          Dead to her. He left when she was
          two.

<b>          MRS. TYLER
</b>          Oh. Well, I'm happy to pay for the

</b>          You don't get along with your son?
          She gives him a look. She's both offended by, and appreciative
          of, his bluntness. Looks out at Mitch:

<b>          MRS. TYLER
</b>          He's like my father. Which means, I
          guess, that he'll do very well.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          He's done well to get Miss Slim.

<b>          MRS. TYLER
</b>          Yes, he has, hasn't he? He's married
          down, but he's gotten value.
           As Phil reacts, he notices his wife, SALIMA, has joined him.
          With her are two kids (5 and 2).
          Salima's looking out at the floor: not at Slim, but at Ginny
          and her dance partner. We see a thought cross her mind. She
          bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids.
          They whoop their response, run out to Ginny (who looks quite
          uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress).

<b>          FIVE YEAR OLD SON
</b>          Mom! Mom! Mom! Can we spend the
          night at Phil and Salima's house?
          Ginny looks over, winks at Salima, and kisses her kids:

</b>          Don't eat at their ice cream, huh?
          They squeal with pleasure and run off.
          Ginny turns back, resumes dancing with JOE (24, handsome in a
          casual way, a good guy):

          sexual encounter.

          She pulls him into a kiss, and...well: he's not a bad kisser...
          We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving. Suddenly:
          tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him...

</b>
<b>                         SLIM
</b>          For ever and ever?
          He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions:

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          You're safe with me, Slim. You're
          safe, and it's okay to be happy.
          We deserve it.
          They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over,
          waits. When they break:

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          I'm sorry, I gotta get up five
          o'clock to buy green beans.
          He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand:

          give money to groom. You don't
          need it, but...

          could possibly have.

<b>                         PHIL
</b>          No substitute. I am real thing.
          She kisses him, and he goes. They look after him.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          He really loves you.
          She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of
          course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away.
          Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top
          of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is
          this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers:

          He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor.
          Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You
          have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true...

          the furnishings are simple, casual, friendly.

          the office. Slim. Coming toward him. He sees her. Sees her
          expression. She stops. He realizes:

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          You saw the doctor?
          It's so obvious from her face that she barely needs to'say it:

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          I lost this one too.

</b>
          Slim lies in bed. Very pale, a light dust of sweat. We assume
          she's between contractions. Mitch's face inches from hers;
          smothering her with kisses.
          The Nurse brings the baby in, starts to give her to Slim -

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Can I hold her?
          The Nurse looks at Slim,. who nods, and gives Mitch the baby.

          Slim looks adoringly at father and daughter: the sight is
          almost unbelievably sweet.
          His cell phone rings. He keeps dancing, ignoring it.
          After one ring, it stops.
          He's kissing the baby's head over and over, just like he kissed
          Slim, and staring into the infant's eyes -

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          She looks just like my baby
          pictures.
          His cell phone rings again. As if the previous call had been a
          signal.
          Slim looks at him as the phone keeps ringing.
          With some difficulty, juggling the baby, he turns the phone
          off.
          But he doesn't look at Slim.

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          Who was that?

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          I don't know. Who cares? Some
          construction thing, I guess.
          She stares at him.
          He stares at the baby.

<b>                         MITCH

          Remains of a picnic. Slim's playing with their daughter,
          GRACIE, now 4. Says something and Gracie laughs. Slim laughs.

          on, tries to join in, but it's forced-and besides that:
          they're not even looking at him, not inviting his laughter;
          it's all between the mother and child.
          So he stops trying. Just watches them. And before his eyes,
          they become - for an instant - strangers. As this reaction,
          and the subtle hostility it engenders, flicker across his face,
          Slim looks up at him -
          For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf
          between them...
          Then Gracie says something. Slim turns back toward her, the
          "girls" are laughing again...and Mitch is not.

          She's in the bedroom now. It's underlit, full of shadows. In
          scary-movie nomenclature, she's exposed, vulnerable; it feels
          like someone's going to leap out and attack her at any -
          Not this time. She throws on shorts and a t-shirt -

          She looks in on Gracie, sleeping peacefully. Consoling image.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
</b>
          She's washing dishes, bored, humming to herself. The counter's
          covered with take-out food containers: she didn't cook.
          A noise. Pager. Not beeping, just humming slightly: she
          wouldn't even hear it except it's on the tile counter.
          Sounds vaguely like a vibrator. Lying there, just a few feet
          from her. With Mitch's wallet and keys, his cell phone.
          She looks at it. .knows she shouldn't... decides not to...
          Can't resist. Dries her.hands methodically on a dishtowel.
          Picks up the pager. Reads: 33.
          She stares, realizing: it's code.
          She looks at the cell phone. Wonders whether...
          Looks toward the hall. We HEAR the shower still running...
          She picks up his cell phone. Tentatively - she's not sure this
          will work - she presses: RECALL 33.
          The phone flashes NAME, but instead of a name there's: .
          She stares at this, glances again down the hall-takes a deep
          breath.. .and presses SEND.
          Waits... listens nervously...

          Dialtone.
          Slim goes into slow motion. How oddly her arm moves downward.
          She looks at the phone. Blinks. Presses OFF.
          Scans the room as if she's never seen it before.
          One of Gracie's toys lies on the floor. Slim stares at it.
          Reaches down to pick it up, but instead of the toy moving up,
          her body moves down. She slumps to the floor. Sits. Stares.

          A warning: stop it and stop it now.
          Her face: shock. Confusion. Outrage. She raises her hand to
          her cheek. Touches her skin where his fist landed...

          Hears the front door close.

           FOUR JAGUARs lined up. At a respectful distance sit an old
          Toyota (the maid's car) and a pick-up (the gardener's truck).
          Slim parks near the truck.
          Her hand moves to the door handle, but she can't bring herself
          to open it. She sits... paralyzed, a failure.
          In this prolonged pause, Mrs. Tyler bursts out of the house -

          Slim still frozen in exactly the same spot. Still carrying
          Gracie, still with her hand on the knob. Listening. Turning
          her head this way-that way. She hears the COOING DOVE NOISE
          come again from outside.
          That settles it. She pulls the door -

          Phil nods skeptically, and Ginny herself doesn't seem so sure.
          They look at the house-and wait. . .and wait... We want to
          scream: "GO IN! GO! SAVE HER!"
          Suddenly something. Subtle. Was that A SOUND from inside???
          They go on alert. . .step forward... listen more closely...

          Sound of a beating. On Ginny's horrified reaction -
          Baseball bat. Phil smashes a window.
          They climb through the hole into the house -

          Mitch moves and they stare in horror. Lying at his feet is

          First FBI Man stands over Joe, keeping him silent.
          Joe watches the Third FBI Man search the room...
          And then Joe blinks. Moves his eyes, and looks right in Slim's
          direction. He realizes where they must be hiding.

          They head for the door.
          As he goes, "First FBI Man" (a.k.a. John Boy) runs his knife
          along the couch, spilling out its contents...
          .passes the tv set and stabs the tube...
          .runs his knife along the wall, making a vicious scary mark.
          And they vanish. We hear the door SLAM.
          The horizontal band through which Slim was looking widens -

          Gracie's crying. Slim hugs her, says to Joe:

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          Jesus, are you okay?

<b>                         JOE
</b>          I guess.
          (feels his neck)
          I needed a shave, anyway.
          The phone rings.
          They look at it. It can't be who they think it is...
          it rings again. Joe goes to it. Hesitates. Answers:

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Hello?

<b>                         MITCH'S VOICE

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Hello, yes, how are you?
          Joe points at phone: "It's him." He nods toward Gracie,
          indicating Slim should take her into the next room. Slim does.

<b>                         MITCH'S VOICE
</b>          (calm, friendly)
          I assume Slim's called you.
          Joe thinks for a split second, then:

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Of course.

<b>                         MITCH'S VOICE
</b>          Will you give her a message?
          (off his silence)
          If she calls again, I mean.
          Slim and Gracie are in the next room, but Slim's looking
          through the door back at Joe.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          I don't know. I'm on her side
          here, not yours.

</b>          Her side? Come on, Joe, you're a
          smart person. Let me say two words,
          okay? "Lug nuts." You don't want to
          worry they're loose every time you
          get in your car. And how 'bout the
          windows to your apartment: are they
          still locked? A person could go
          crazy thinking about stuff like that.

<b>                         JOE
</b>          Goodbye, Mitch.

<b>                         MITCH'S VOICE

          Joe hangs up. Slim comes back out.

</b>          Wow. Charming.

<b>                         SLIM

          Joe shakes his head - more at Mitch than in answer to her
          question.

<b>          SLIM {CONT.}
</b>          I shouldn't be here -

<b>                         JOE

<b>                         JOE
</b>          (calm, forceful)
          Slim. You can be here anytime.
          She nods. They both know what he's saying: if he's willing to
          take this kind of risk, he's either a very good friend (which
          he is) or he's still in love with her (which he is, also).

<b>          JOE (CONT.)

<b>                         PHIL

          Jackson.
          And he kind of does: arms flailing, not quite connected to his
          body. Just as when we're enjoying this comic sight -
          EXPLOSION behind them -
          They're thrown TOWARD CAMERA -
          Debris flying everywhere -
          They lie on the. ground. Not moving. Are they dead or just
          stunned? Slowly they raise their heads. Blink.
          Look back at the restaurant:
          Starting to go up in flames.

          Joe stares at her, concerned.

          She- goes to the window, parts the curtain: OUTSIDE in the

          time she's been Erin: a colorful elastic bracelet, probably a
          Swatch.
          She gets out of bed and looks out the window -
          Cold morning -
          She goes toward the hall...

          Moving down the hall... each open door feels like a trap ready
          to spring...
          She glances into "Queen Elizabeth's" room... We half expect
          some sort of reaction or exclamation - "Queen E." may be gone -
          but instead "Erin" keeps right on going...
          Vanishes into the bathroom.

          slightly in the wind from the window.
          She wipes herself.
          Still staring at the curtain...
          She stands, pulls up her pajamas...
          Stares.
          Yanks the shower curtain aside -
          Nothing.

          Drinks a little o.3 from a carton.

          GRUNTS, BANGING vs. the walls.

          Toward his face...
          At the last instant he realizes what she must be doing -
          But it's too late. She presses a button -

          "Erin" coming back onto the road, fighting to keep control, and
          the road narrowing more and more, down to one tight lane. This

          their small suitcase in on top.
          "Erin" reaches up under the driver's seat and pulls out a

          She moves quickly to an attacking position, standing over him.

          I'm in a big city now, meeting with

          Sees a guy in a GREEN TRENCHCOAT across the street.

          Sitting by the window is TOVA. As Slim walks over, Tova pulls
          on a wig which matches Slim's haircut. There is now a strong
          resemblance.

</b>          I was a cop. I got shot, took

          Slim thinks about Tova's voice. Takes out her cell phone.

          He walks around the place in the dark.
          In his boxer shorts and t-shirt. He looks vulnerable...

          He walks right toward Slim, curls around the counter -

          water. Auto-dials her cell phone.

          She hangs up.
          Retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out
          tools, equipment, etc. Picks up a screwdriver and starts
          searching the apartment, checking the phone line, following it
          to the place where it enters the apartment.
          MONTAGE INTERCUT WITH FLASHES of Slim' a face: a running tab
          on her emotions. Intensity, focus, determination, fear,. ..and,
          as the sequence builds: concern about what she doing...

          Finds the electrical box, opens it, finds the main switch.
          Removes all the knives from the kitchen... hides them...
          Walks the apartment-familiarizing herself with every inch of
          it-occasionally she moves a piece of furniture slightly... we
          realize: she's assessing fighting spaces. angles...
          She looks from one piece of furniture to another, back and
          forth, gauging the distance between them.
          She eats a snack from his refrigerator...

          Uses a metal detector to search the apartment:
          in a drawer of the night table beside his bed, she finds a
          pistol. Removes it. There are papers in the same drawer,
          notes or something. She throws these in the trash.
          She takes out three letters. As the CAMERA sweeps over one of
          them, we hear her voice:

<b>          SLIM (V.0.)
</b>          ". .thanks for letting me come talk
          about Gracie. And I'm glad you're
          willing to admit your temper, and -
          let's not mince words - the physical
          abuse you subjected me to."
          And glances at SECOND LETTER:

<b>          SLIM (V.0.)
</b>          "Perhaps with your new attitude,
          we can really work something out.
          Per your last letter, I'll see you
          the evening of..."
          She puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was.
          They're not in envelopes; they're loose, open.
          She picks up the metal detector, resumes her search.
          The machine beeps insistently around his desk. She can't find
          anything. Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the
          drawers: a second gun is in there.
          With the gun are papers: reports from private detectives
          looking for her, an assessment of his custody rights...
          She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper.
          Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie. Rips it up.
          Puts the metal detector back in the duffle.
          Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants.
          Takes the distinctive red bag (from the electronics store) out
          of the duffle. There's a machine inside. She plugs it in,
          tucks it behind the couch.
          Puts her cell phone beside it.

          Barefoot, she begins to glide around the space. Backing up.
          Moving with ease and grace, sliding deftly to the side as she
          approaches a couch, desk, chair. She's building on her earlier
          reconnaissance: learning where the furniture is and how to
          navigate around it...

          only now her sliding is smooth, graceful; almost a dance.
          As if hearing a distant signal, she slows to a stop.
          For a long moment she stands perfectly still. Poised. Like an
          animal in the forest.
          There's a chair facing the front door. She glances at it. No.
          She walks behind the couch, turns off the machine, picks up her

          Mitch enters, closes and locks the door.
          Turns on the light.
          He walks back to the rear of the space, hangs up his coat.
          Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket.
          The lights go out.
          Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness.
          He looks out the window, sees:
          The neighboring buildings still have light and power.
          He cocks his head, listening.
          Silence.
          Walks to the door of the bedroom area. Waits.

          the coffee.
          He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters
          Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to
          be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor -

<b>          SLIM'S VOICE {CONT.}
</b>          I found it, Mitch.
          His hand leaves the drawer.
          He thinks.
          Picks up the phone, listens. Dead.
          Looks around... can't see her...
          Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes
          out his cell phone. We see the GLOW of its dial.
          He punches 911 and pressed SEND.
          The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on.
          He stares at it.
          Tries again. 911, SEND.
          Again it goes dead.

          Walks out of the bedroom area.
          Looks around the vast space.
          Spooky. Slanting light and dense shadow.
          He doesn't see her.

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          Fair to whom?
          As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area
          between two couches.
          She has no weapon.
          She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms
          just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny.
          He moves toward her.

<b>                         SLIM

          What you were going to San Francisco
          for: the chance to get me alone?
          He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses.
          He begins to stalk her.
          And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in
          the way she was practicing.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          I don't understand, Slim.

          She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants
          to know where he's going to attack.

<b>          MITCH (CONT.)

          She does not respond.
          He throws three punches. None of them hits her.
          He's unfazed, keeps stalking...

          Her expression remains neutral, focused.
          He takes this to be agreement.

<b>          MITCH (CONT.)

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          You don't have the guts.
          She just looks at him.
          He blinks, worried for an instant. Covers it with a smile:

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          It's not self-defense when you

<b>                         SLIM
</b>          So far you're attacking me.
          He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in -
          She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps
          over the couch to avoid being hit.
          He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good,
          and she's waiting for him as he stumbles -
          With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose.
          He goes down. Stays there. For the first time it occurs to
          him: this might not be easy.
          He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood.

<b>                         SLIM

          He resumes stalking her. Only he's angry now, and it's scary.

          She reacts -
          He sees it, rushes her -
          Punching as he goes. From the standpoint of pure physics, he
          makes a terrifying force. Until:
          She steps back, grabs his arm, whips him vs. the brick wall -
          He hits it, bounces off.
          Cut on his forehead, blood streaming down his face.
          He stares at her... breathing hard... trying to put it together:

          terrifying form of combat: a huge person attacking a tiny one.
          If he should hit her even once, a glancing blow, she will go
          down, she will break, it will be over.

          wild, almost comical. Others come so close we hear-the wind,
          feel their power, feel his sweat on her...
          CONTINUE this terrifying choreographed dance with destruction
          for as long as it will hold. At every instant, we fear for her
          bones and her life. Sometimes she leans back like Muhammad Ali
          to barely slip a punch, and we see terror on her face, married
          to determination. She knows the score. and the odds.
          Finally, in frustration at so many misses, he grabs an ashtray,
          hurls.it at her -
          it flies over her head -
          He punches again and again, wildly.
          She remains untouched.
          He stops. With all the blood, he looks like a wild animal.
          He makes a great effort to pull himself together...

          I don't care how long it takes.
          We both know: Ionly have to hit
          you once. Once, and it's over.
          She laughs at him.
          This is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can
          stand. He rushes at her again, fast -
          She starts left -
          He blocks her way -
          She starts right -
          Again he's blocking her -
          She lunges to the left, through a narrow space -
          He punches, grazing her hair; punches again, just missing, and
          a third time. We feel the awesome power behind these blows.
          She's in the clear again. Smiles casually. Clearly part of
          her strategy is to keep him angry:

          against his head -

          She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed -
          Right into the opposite wall.
          The top of his head hits the wall.

          Goes to him. Wary.
          Gives him a reflex test -
          No reaction. He's unconscious.
          She tests his neck for a pulse.
          Apparently he's still alive, because she raises her hand
          over her head.

          She retrieves her cell phone, turns off the cell-phone blocker,

          Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp.
          She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side -
          - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull.
          Still sends her crashing to the floor.
          Now she does not move.
          He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but

          Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it -
          Rage.
          He pulls his foot back to kick her -
          Her eyes are open, just a slit -
          His foot swinging forward...
          As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it -
          He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her -
          But she's already rolling, out from under him... and up -
          Coming to her feet -
          He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug...
          SLOW MOTION. She's ready. Her face alert. Center of gravity
          low. Arm low,.fist low... As her motion unfurls:
          Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly
          executed, is the most difficult,
          powerful, and beautiful of punches.
          Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of-
          gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin -
          as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the
          central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely.
          Mitch flies backward...
          There's a table behind him.
          His head cracks on the table.
          His neck snaps.
          He lands on the floor: twisted, broken.
          Slim stares at him.
          There's no way a living man could assume the position now
          occupied by her former husband.

          Her face registers what she feels. Horror, relief.

          Listens: no one there.
