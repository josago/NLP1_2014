               This story takes place during a World Series between the 
               Mets and the A's. Canseco plays for Oakland, and Strawberry 
               is still with New York.

<b>                                         DAY ONE:

<b>                                   GAME THREE: LT WINS
</b>
<b>               EXT: EARLY MORNING - LT'S HOME - QUEENS
</b>
               This typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other 
               neighboring, nearly identical HOUSES.

               The MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING, LAWN MOWERS, and 
               SHOUTED GOOD-BYES are heard coming from many HOUSES on this 
               close-knit block. A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside 
<b>               LT'S HOUSE.
</b>
               LT, hurried and harried, stumbles out his FRONT DOOR. He 
               heads for his CAR, parked askew in the DRIVEWAY.

               LT is some 40 years old. His natural swagger makes up for 
               his lack of conventional good looks. He is obviously hung-
               over.

               LT squints, pained by the SUN. He fumbles with his SHADES, 
               puts them on.

               LT's TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of 
               the HOUSE, bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy. 
               The hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS. 
               Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip 
               them up.

               LT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN 
               YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot. Many 
               other members of LT's EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP 
               and the LAWN.

               As the TWINS cross the LAWN, the bickering turns physical. 
               They start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES. The TWINS 
               pile into LT'S CAR.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

<b>               INT: MORNING - LT'S CAR - EN ROUTE TO/AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL
</b>
               The CAR is obviously LT's home away from home. FOOD DEBRIS, 
               BEER CANS, VODKA BOTTLES and other garbage litter the 
               interior.

               An impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats.

               An old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD.

               As the TWINS get in, LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit 
               detritus.

               To little avail. The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations; 
               they have evidently seen it all before.

               As LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL, the three play wild rough-
               house.

               The CAR swerves crazily.

                         Strawberry!

               The TWINS whoop and shout, celebrating LT's -- and their own -- 
               favorite player.

               They pass the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BUS. It has stopped for a 
               moment taking on KIDS. LT cuts off the TWINS' tirade.

<b>                                     LT

                         the nuns whack the shit outa ya both.

               LT and the TWINS banter back and forth, poke each other and 
               box around. The apparent hostility of their words is balanced 
               by the laughter and gung-ho play of the rough-housing. The 
               TWINS yell cat-calls as they drive past a BLONDE PEDESTRIAN. 
               LT joins in.

               ANGLE - Through the WINDSHIELD, the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL comes 
               into view. A CROWD of UNIFORMED KIDS is gathered outside. 
               SEVERAL NUNS turn the CROWD into two neat rows, and usher 
               the KIDS inside.

               The TWINS get out. Join the line of students entering the 
<b>               SCHOOL.
</b>
               The instant the KIDS have left the CAR -- LT takes out some 
               COKE. Snorts it. He takes his GUN out of hiding.

               LT steers with his knees as he drives off toward the City.

<b>               EXT: AFTERNOON - QUEENS - CRIME SCENE
</b>
               ANGLE - A CAR WINDSHIELD. Blood-spattered and shot up. The 
               DEAD BODIES of TWO GIRLS are in the front seat.

               LT gets out of his CAR and makes his way through the COPS 
               and GAWKERS.

               The BET COP comes up to LT.

</b>                         Two Black kids came up out of nowhere 
                         and shot those chicks. Then they 
                         laughed as they walked away. The 
                         Press is gonna call it the "Giggling 
                         Man Murders." I'll tell ya. What a 
                         world.

               LT gives a cursory glance to the crime scene. A couple of 
               COPS greet him; LT keeps walking.

               The BET COP digs his attitude.

                         Mets!

               FOLLOW LT - over to a GROUP of COPS. They greet him and 
               everyone immediately crams into a parked CAR. The CAR stays 
               parked for the duration of their meeting.

               Now that LT, the BET COP and the OTHER COPS are inside the 
               CAR, they can do business. LT pays several COPS their WINNINGS 
               for last night's game. CASH and congratulatory banter is 
               exchanged.

               Now LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME, 
               the FOURTH GAME of the World Series. LT urges the COPS to 
               bet against the Mets.

                         This game's going to Oakland. Not a 
                         doubt in my mind, man.

               Silence. The COPS think about it for a moment.

               BET COP speaks up first; hands LT some CASH. When he talks 
               to LT, his fawning posture is obvious.

               COP ONE SHRUGS his assent, gives CASH to LT. The OTHER COPS 
               follow his example, place their BETS on OAKLAND.

               The COP BETS total $800 -- on OAKLAND. LT has obviously been 
               the bookie for this precinct for a long time. He takes care 
               of a lot of action and has these guy's faith.

               LT nods a goodbye, quickly gets out of the CAR. The BET COP 
               and the OTHER COPS remain inside.

               JC nods, bemused by LT's manic behavior. JC, in contrast, is

               Religious/hip artifacts abound. It's a nice, if messy 
               apartment.

               However, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500 
               that ARIANE quotes as her rent.

               ARIANE is LT's mistress.

               BOWTAY, her girlfriend, lounges on the COUCH. BOWTAY plays 
               the third when LT is in the mood for a menage a trois. She's 
               around a lot.

               BOWTAY is already zonked out on something. Maybe LUDES.

               LT gives her the COKE. ARIANE takes some immediately. BOWTAY 
               sloppily partakes.

               Before LT can even sit down, the GIRLS start bitching.

               ARIANE lifts BOWTAY to her feet. BOWTAY staggers into the 
               center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. It 
               happens to be appropriate for the scene.

               BOWTAY begins to recite the monologue from the very end of 
               the play. "When will the world be ready to receive thy 
               saints?", etc.

               BOWTAY messes up a line; ARIANE lashes her with a BELT.

               BOWTAY doesn't move, continues reciting. ARIANE joins in 
               from time to time.

               LT is turned on.

               He begins KISSING ARIANE, then goes down onto the floor.

               The KITCHEN is very bachelorette. No FOOD or COOKING 
               IMPLEMENTS in sight.

               LT is messing around, looking for something to DRINK. He

               A display of FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES extends onto the

               Closer now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing 
               with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much 
               English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues 
               fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.

               A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET.

                         the block when I caught up with them.

               The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his 
               side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same 
               time --

               The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out 
               the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy.

               The YOUNG UNIFORMED COP rushes out of the MARKET, GUN raised 
               in one hand, BEER CAN in the other. He's relieved that a cop 
               wasn't shot, but the whole situation makes him uneasy.

               LT grabs the BEER, points to the KOREAN OWNER.

               LT swaggers around the store, GUN in hand, drinking the BEER, 
               assessing the inventory with a proprietary air. He pretends 
               to SHOOT at various products. Plays around.

               ARIANE gracefully takes a hit of her own.

               They are both very high, already. Beginning to NOD OUT.

               A CARTOON EXPLOSION wakes LT. He jumps up in a panic.

               LT bounds off the COUCH, Still half-asleep, he crawls to the 
               TV, turns on GAME FOUR. The LITTLE GIRL starts CRYING.

               An ANCIENT AUNT pokes her head into the LIVING ROOM.

               LT leans into the TV, transfixed, as --

               with runners on base. LT CHEERS.

               DOORS SLAM (OFF). The TWINS have come home from school.

               They burst into the LIVING ROOM, loud as Hell. Furious about

                         and gone home.

               LT curses and stomps around. The TWINS mimic his every move. 
               All three are pissed. The rest of the FAMILY pays no mind.

               LT is furious. He COKES UP. DRINKS heavily.

               Tired of the SPORTS STATIONS, LT turns on 911. There is a 
               call for an uptown MURDER SCENE.

               CU - A YOUNG BLACK DEALER, eyes open, shot dead.

               LT drives up, sizes up the scene. It's fresh territory. He'll 
               milk it for what it's worth.

               LT ignores his colleagues, the COPS ON THE SCENE. He knows 
               some of the DEALERS and STREET CHARACTERS on the sidelines.

               He heads straight for them.

               LT greets an impressively beautiful, six foot tall 
               TRANSVESTITE. He takes her aside.

                         But there's a ki under the back seat.

</b>                         I'll put it in my trunk.

               LT saunters up to the MURDER CAR, DEAD WILLIE still in the 
               front seat. LT is obviously berserk to get the KI, but he 
               can't show it. LT susses out the situation.

               Around him, POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting 
               fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE -- to no 
               apparent avail.

               LT uses his Lieutenants' privilege to enter the MURDER CAR 
               and begin his own investigation.

               TIRE TRACKS are discovered nearby. The OTHER COPS are 
               distracted.

               LT takes his shot. He reaches for and finds the KI of COCAINE 
               under the BACK SEAT. LT slips it under his COAT and emerges 
               from the MURDER CAR.

               Outside the MURDER CAR, LT makes to stand up. In the act, he -- 
               DROPS the BAG of COKE!

               LT is stunned. He can't believe the KI is actually in the 
               shitty, gutter water, in plain view of the other COPS.

               The COPS spot the KILO of COKE. Even those COPS that were 
               far away, somehow know what has happened. They quickly gather 
               round the MURDER CAR, LT, and the KI.

               The PLASTIC BAG filled with WHITE POWDER floats on the DEEP

               LT is silent wrath incarnate.

                         What d'ya know... A kilo of 'caine...

               Among the gathered COPS, only a SERGEANT is not quite 
               convinced.

               The other COPS ignore the query.

               LT walks away.

               LT has successfully covered himself, but he walks off cursing 
               and mumbling.

               VERONICA is laughing demonstratively in the background.

                         I can't fucking believe it...

               LT is further away now from the scene of WILLIE'S murder and 
               his own debacle. LT overhears something. Cuts off his 
               muttering.

               A group of COPS are talking about the big news from the early 
               morning.

                         they'd rape a nun, man...

               LT stops in his tracks. The erotic import of this conversation 
               has seized LT's imagination. He heads toward the cluster of 
               COPS, cuts in.

                         raped?

                         gave it to the nuns but good.

               The COPS turn away, continue to talk among themselves. LT 
               walks away.

               LT pulls up. Parks near a group of OTHER COPS, waiting by 
               their CARS.

               HOSPITAL fauna passes by in the background: DOCTORS, NURSES, 
               PATIENTS in all stages of recovery or relapse. The HOSPITAL 
               itself rises in the background. It looks like a prison.

               LT leaves his CAR, heads for the GROUP of COPS. He joins 
               them, sits down on the HOOD of a nearby CAR. The COPS are 
               all DRINKING heavily.

               Present are the BET COP, and several other FAMILIAR COPS 
               from previous scenes.

               The COPS keep DRINKING. All of them lounging around on or 
               beside the CARS.

               LT watches quietly, taking it all in. As if following the

               COPS avoid each others' eyes. Competition has begun. No one 
               shares information, each after the reward for himself.

               LT comes down off the CAR HOOD. Now he has to feign pride in

               LT has to convince the COPS to keep betting -- he can't afford

                         television-time for commercials during 
                         the series? Especially if it's a New 
                         York team? They won't close the gold 
                         mine after only four games. It'll 
                         last a full seven. Too many people 
                         wanna milk it for what it's worth.

               SEVERAL COPS, including some of the COPS who have been hanging 
               out in front of the HOSPITAL, go double or nothing on OAKLAND. 
               LT takes their BET MONEY -- $900.

               One COP doesn't go along with the deal. LT painfully pays

               LT sits back on top of his CAR, DRINKING heavily. He toasts

               The HOSPITAL is an inferno. LT exploits his cop privileges; 
               shows his BADGE to the GUARDS.

               He wants to get into the inner sanctum. Beyond where even 
               COPS were allowed to go. He wants to get to the NUN.

               A sexy NURSE stops him.

<b>                                     NURSE

               LT can't help but check her out and flirt.

               The NURSE looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the 
<b>               CORRIDOR.
</b>
               LT continues his hunt.

               He comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with "QUARANTINE" 
               SIGNS. One too many, perhaps. LT senses the NUN is inside.

               He has to open the DOOR, but hopes he won't get a blast of 
               disease in his face. He CROSSES himself -- wearing a smirk, 
               but nonetheless. Going on instinct, LT opens the door a crack.

               He's right. It's the NUN. He positions himself outside the 
               DOOR, keeping it open a few inches. He peeks inside without 
               being seen.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

<b>               INT: LATE NIGHT - THE NUN'S HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM
</b>
               From just outside the door, LT peep-toms on the NUN while 
               she is being examined. He sees her stark naked, laid out on 
               a table, her legs spread wide apart.

               The DOCTORS, NURSES, COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if they 
               are automatons. They don't grasp either the humanity or the 
               trotitism of the scene. LT does. The image of The Alabaster 
               Nun turns him on no end. Yet there is also a deeper pathos 
               to the scene.

               And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful. She doesn't speak. 
               Looks like a Pieta.

               A DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a FEMALE 
               COP. The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-backed 
               pad. As if it's a parking ticket.

               The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to 
               be apparent to LT -- and the NUN -- alone.

                         They inserted a crucifix eleven 
                         centimeters into her vaginal aperture, 
                         breaking the hymen membrane. Then 
                         they pursued the same course with 
                         their natural organs of sexual 
                         penetration. They used a sharp object, 
                         probably a hunting knife with a curved 
                         blade, to carve a cross between her 
                         shoulder blades, entering the flesh 
                         an average of nearly one centimeter 
                         throughout the area of the wound. 
                         They --

               Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks 
               up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes.

<b>               INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT
</b>
               LT has been there for some time. They are alone. They've 
               both been DRINKING and COKING.

               LT is carrying on about the NUN. As he speaks about various 
               subjects, his tone changes radically. From contempt and 
               cynicism to profound reverence. From decadence -- to awe. 
               ARIANE, too, manages to switch from one attitude to the other.

</b>                         Have you ever seen a naked nun? I 
                         tell you, man, I went to school with 
                         the nuns, I've seen hundreds since 
                         then and I've never even seen a nun's 
                         belly button, you understand? But 
                         this nun, let me tell you. What a 
                         beautiful lady...
                              (snaps out of his awe)
                         And where'd the Church get the 50 G 
                         in the first place? The fucking Church 
                         is the biggest scam going. You know 
                         what's the real killer? It costs 
                         $8,000 per kid for them to go to 
                         parochial school. I've got three 
                         kids in there already, with two on 
                         the way! Christ. That fucking reward 
                         is my money, man! But that's Church 
                         policy. The Pope is the world's 
                         biggest bookie. Makes people bet on 
                         their own salvation! Double or nothing 
                         on Heaven. You go to Hell -- then go 
                         to Hell. In the beginning was the 
                         Word, and the Word was bullshit.

               ARIANE can't stop thinking about the rape.

                         because she wears a penguin suit, 
                         the church puts up 50 G for the guys 
                         who dared to rape her. Do you think 
                         they'd put up a dime if you got raped? 
                         Of course not. Or even for your little

               LT snaps out once again, grabs the TELEPHONE. He dials LITE.

               He's not in. LT leaves ARIANE'S NUMBER on LIMELITE'S BEEPER.

                         you cigarette burns!

               LT stubs out his CIGARETTE on the back of his hand. He does 
               the move with intensity and bravado.

               ARIANE responds by calmly doing the same. But she does it 
               entirely impassively, and rubs the CIGARETTE into her flesh 
               longer than LT did.

               ARIANE comes over to LT and starts kissing and licking his

               LT hesitates.

               ARIANE kneels down in front of LT. As if in prayer.

               She starts giving him head.

               LT hangs up, thinks ARIANE won't resurface the God Question.

               ARIANE does, even as she gives him head. Every time she 
               speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. This dialectic

               LT cries out. Snaps to attention. Looks at ARIANE.

               ARIANE gives him head again. LT is more excited now than

               As if in answer. LT begins to RECITE THE ACT OF CONTRITION

               This turns on ARIANE. She stops talking. Writhes and grapples 
               him.

               LT is reaching climax. When describing Jesus rising again --

               LT has an orgasm.

               the CAR.

               POV LT - A CAR with only one TAILLIGHT. A Cyclops in the 
               darkness. Under a STREETLIGHT, JERSEY PLATES are visible. So 
               are the two inebriated, leather-clad GIRLS inside. LT pulls 
               them over.

               LT comes on to them. He's way out there. The GIRLS are 
               smashed.

               LT notes their "Heavy Metal" CROSSES, and questions them.

               LT gets into the CAR, looks around. He finds a BAG OF POT.

               LT waves the POT in front of the GIRLS.

               The GIRLS are petrified.

               LT grins. He takes out his own ROLLING PAPER, starts to ROLL 
               a JOINT with their POT.

               LT stumbles into the CHURCH. Alone now, he notes various

               blind drunk.

               The enormous, graphically bloody CRUCIFIX confronts him.

<b>               INT: MORNING - CHURCH/CONVENT
</b>
               LT wakes up. Ruckus all around him. The COPS are there in 
               force -- including some of the guys from the BAR, the UPTOWN 
               MURDER and the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. They are privately 
               checking out the Scene of the Crime, looking for leads that 
               will give them an advantage. Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to 
               talk. The NUNS are in a circle of interrogators. At first, 
               LT can't even see them.

               The ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped. They carved 
               crosses on her.

               In the background, the questioning has already begun. The 
               interrogators become increasingly frustrated. It can be heard 
               in their voices. They want the reward, and -- despite a 
               certain constipated "respect" in their attitude -- the COPS 
               are willing to browbeat the NUNS to get it.

               LT silently bums a COFFEE off a COP and staggers into the 
               ring.

               LT hangs back in the crowd, staring at the YOUNG NUN as the 
               COPS interrogate both NUNS.

<b>                                     COP 1

                         Anything at all?

               The ELDERLY NUN speaks up.

<b>                                     ELDERLY NUN

                         anything, but I did hear them. They 
                         were young. And there were two of 
                         them. They spoke Spanish. One of 
                         them was named Julio.

               LT, on the sidelines, turns to an OLDER COP. LT mutters his 
               commentary

<b>                                     LT

                         Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics 
                         named "Julio".

               The ELDERLY NUN lowers her head. Shamed.

                         am so sorry, Officers.

               Now the COPS are magnetized by the YOUNG NUN. She does not 
               appear to need GLASSES. Evidently, she could give the COPS 
               what they want.

                         tell us anything?

               LT watches the YOUNG NUN as --

               POV LT - The YOUNG NUN smiles a quiet, intractable smile.

               COP 2 is screaming mad, but tries to hide it.

               LT has observed their interaction. Though he would have loved 
               to have heard some information from the YOUNG NUN, her 
               defiance gives him even more pleasure.

               The MONSIGNOR comes forward to "translate" the NUNS' stubborn 
               silence. He is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition -- 
               this is his big chance. He would like to be Cardinal some 
               day, but never will be. He enjoys the spotlight as he 
               pontificates.

</b>                         Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years 
                         old. I'm not from this Church, of 
                         course, but I assume they'll be 
                         getting her a new pair of glasses. 
                         Apparently she's legally blind without 
                         them. The Sister who suffered a rape 
                         is just 17. She arrived from Ireland 
                         only a couple of months ago. This -- 
                         event -- is just too much for them 
                         to take!

               The MONSIGNOR clears his throat demonstratively, takes a 
               dicitous tone.

</b>                         Listen. The Church would like to 
                         know who did it just as much as the 
                         NYPD. These arrant criminals broke 
                         the laws of man, and the laws of 
                         God. The Church wants nothing more 
                         than to see them behind bars. That's 
                         why we're offering the $50,000 reward 
                         to whomever brings them in. I'm sure 
                         our hero will be one of New York's 
                         Finest.

               The YOUNG NUN shoots the MONSIGNOR an offended look.

               It appears for a moment as if the YOUNG NUN makes eye contact 
               with LT. But he can't be sure.

               LT leaves the crowd, disappears out the DOOR.

               Suddenly the NUN appears.

               LT hides, watches as the NUN enters the CONFESSIONAL Once 
               she is ensconced inside, LT stealthly approaches the 
               CONFESSIONAL and from right outside -- a tantalizing proximity -- 
               he listens as she confesses to the PRIEST. (This is an elderly 
               PRIEST with a striking, unusual voice. Not the MONSIGNOR 
               from the COPS' interrogation of the NUNS. Scene 20.)

                         It has been two days since my last 
                         confession. Father, my sin is a 
                         terrible sin. A sin of omission. 
                         There was another sin that happened 
                         at the same time, and in the same 
                         place, but my sin I think was graver 
                         stil.

                         you yesterday morning. I expected 
                         that you would want to speak to me 
                         about it. But you could have come to 
                         my office. Your being here, in the 
                         confessional, implies that you, 
                         Sister, have done something wrong. 
                         You haven't. I assure you. I feared 
                         you might have misplaced feelings of 
                         guilt. If you condemn yourself because 
                         you experienced feelings of... 
                         curiosity or even... pleasure, you 
                         mustn't --

               The NUN LAUGHS. At first, it sounds like crying. But it is a 
               strange, low laughter.

                         natural, so -- No. I have sinned. 
                         And you must listen if you are to 
                         prescribe an appropriate act of 
                         contrition, and to absolve me. Father, 
                         what would you do if you had but one 
                         day in which to use your arms to 
                         serve God?

                         the Mother Superior died, and I kept 
                         the cool, damp cloth on her forehead 
                         freshly moist. Father, what would 
                         you do if you had but one day in 
                         which to use your legs to serve God?

                         elsewhere? Nothing. Nothing at all. 
                         There were always two of us in the 
                         act. The act was half my own. It 
                         does not seem to me the act was half 
                         the act of a once of Christ.

                         loss of my virginity. The rape forced 
                         upon me a choice. As a vessel of the 
                         spirit. I could have imbued my vagina 
                         with God. Or, I could have turned 
                         away from God and voided my body of 
                         spirit, so that all that was left 
                         for those boys was a lump of flesh. 
                         I chose the second path. The easier, 
                         path. The path of the material world. 
                         The path no nun has the right to 
                         take. And so, I sinned.
                              (beat)
                         My vagina spread, but spread no word. 
                         It opened, on nothingness. It gave 
                         nothing at all and left nothing 
                         behind. No trace of my act, yes my

                         in the landscape of God.

               The NUN'S description of the RAPE is both a turn on for LT 
               and a matter of profound curiosity. Something divine. His 
               silent reactions embody both decadence and awe. This apparent 
               paradox can find unified expression in his character, though 
               at other moments it threatens to tear him apart. The tension 
               between the two polarities will propel him toward his destiny.

                         sperm -- hatred to love. And maybe 
                         to have saved their souls. They did 
                         not love me. I ought to have loved 
                         them. As Jesus loved those who reviled

                         did not rape a nun. But a nun has 
                         been raped. And the nun must now 
                         atone for her sin. For a God-given 
                         part of her was wasted. A part which 
                         other women use for procreation, for 
                         conjugal fulfillment, for expressions

                         saw fear. They should have met the 
                         eyes of a lover, And felt the presence

                         two boys whose prayer was more 
                         legible, more poignant, more 
                         anguished. Two young men who threw 
                         themselves upon the altar and took 
                         me with them. And I did nothing for 
                         them. I can only hope that someone 
                         will.

               LT can't help but start up. As if, telepathically, the NUN 
               knew he was there and cried out to him. Asked him to complete 
               her mission.

               LT senses the confession is over. As the PRIEST begins to 
               speak again, LT snaps to and returns to his original hiding 
               place, near the CANDLES.

               LT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL, KNEELS, holds 
               her ROSARY BEADS, and begins to whisper the ACT OF CONTRITION -- 
               what LT recited as ARIANE gave him head.

               The NUN does penance. LT watches her, still hidden, and 
               transfixed.

               above the writhing crowd.

               LT pursues him. Finally catches him.

               They mime the deal. LT buys some COKE for immediate use.

               LT does the COKE off his wrist as he moves through the CROWD.

               LT trembles, frantic and manic-high, as he goes to his meeting 
               with LITE. LT plows his way through the CROWD, heading toward 
               the back of the club and the entrance to the V.I.P ROOM.

               Even this state, when he sights ACQUAINTANCES. LT turns on 
               the charm and works the room.

               LT nears the V.I.P. ROOM.

               POV LT - The entrance to the V.I.P. ROOM is guarded by a 
               PURPLE VELVET ROPE and an effete DOORMAN.

               When the DOORMAN sights LT, he lifts the ROPE, nods 
               respectfully at the habitual patron.

<b>               INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB - THE V.I.P. ROOM
</b>
               LT arrives.

               The V.I.P. ROOM is more laid-back, less populous than the 
               throng-filled cave outside. The MUSIC is muted here, and 
               more interesting.

               PARTIERS sit at the BAR, or at COCKTAIL TABLES. CHIC WAITRONS 
               serve the clientele: HOTSHOT BOHEMIAN REGULARS, DRUG DEALERS 
               and HOPEFUL RICH ADDICTS. In the privacy of the V.I.P.ROOM, 
               drug use is hardly concealed.

               LT sashays over to LITE'S table, sits down. LT has taken on 
               an attitude of false bravado. He greets LITE with a crazy 
               grin. LITE is grim, doesn't respond in kind. He's not amused.

               LT orders a VODKA.

               A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers LT's VODKA. LT orders another 
               one, flirts with her -- she's gone in a flash. LT downs the 
               VODKA in one shot.

                         I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking 
                         Catholic.

               This breaks LT up. He laughs until he cries. LITE watches 
               the spectacle. Falls silent. They sit quietly for a moment.

               LT, impatient with the delivery of his second VODKA, takes a 
               bottle cut of his COAT and re-fills his GLASS. DRINKS it 
               down.

               LITE tries changing the subject.

               LT looks as LITE as if he's crazy. He shakes his head. Sing-
               songs at him as if trying to teach an impaired student.

               A change comes over LT. He leans in, gets seriously excited. 
               LT is possessed by his memory of this afternoon's game.

               LT shakes his head. Repeats himself in that sing-song, 
               didactic way.

               LITE stands up. He writes the BOOKIE'S NUMBER on a MATCHBOOK 
               and gives it to LT.

               LITE leans over and gives LT a final warning.

               LT LAUGHS. He's already onto the next thing. He checks out 
               the GIRLS at the other TABLES.

               LITE takes to go. Then decides to try once more to get LT's 
               attention.

               LT is still laughing as LITE leaves the V.I.P ROOM.

               Before going out the door, LITE turns to look one more time 
               at his friend.

               POV LITE - LT is engaged in a clumsy come-on. Oblivious. The 
               last thing LITE sees is LT grabbing a COCKTAIL WAITRESS' LEG 
               and falling out of his chair. LT LAUGHS all the way to the

               LT elbows his way through the crowd.

               He makes moves on GIRLS. Banters with PATRONS. At the DOOR, 
               he hesitates before going out, dallies with the BOUNCER.

               LT felt safe in the CLUB. New he's gotta go OUTSIDE. He's

               staircase.

               STRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE.

               LT climbs. He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready. To LT, it 
               seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn.

               On one landing, he comes upon a PIT-BULL. A GRANDMOTHER pulls 
               him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH.

               On another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the 
               shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out 
               of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT 
               down with him.

               On another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE. 
               It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he 
               reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking.

               A cheerful apartment. Quite different in atmosphere from the

               JC reaches into a bookcase, looking for something.

               Meanwhile, LT looks around the room.

               POV LT - A SHRINE is in the corner. CANDLES are lit before 
               PLASTER SAINTS, AFRICAN DEITIES, other icons abstruse and 
               exotic. A large "MADONNA AND CHILD", painted on black velvet, 
               hangs above the SHRINE. The MADONNA AND CHILD are BLACK.

               LT takes this all in. JC startles him.

               JC is holding a CIGAR BOX. He opens it. It's full of CASH. 
               JC hands it to LT.

<b>               EXT: NIGHT - STREET NEAR ARIANE'S APARTMENT
</b>
               LT walks through the streets on the way to ARIANE'S. He 
               carries the CIGAR BOX.

               Suddenly, a SHOT rings out.

               ZOOM IN ON - CU LT  Horror. Doubtless it was meant for him. 
               LT panics. Freezes. As in a dream, he cannot run.

               POV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in 
               the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that 
               create the mescarole canyon of the STREET.

               LT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own 
               terror.

               Suddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself 
               against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears --

               A BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness.

               It is almost as loud as the "SHOT".

<b>                                     BRASH FEMALE VOICE

                         up the ass!

               LT can't believe that there is no "SNIPER", there was never 
               any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE!

               ANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly.

               Evidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED.

               LT is still pressed against the wall, GUN at the ready. He 
               cannot be relieved. The terror is with him.

<b>               INT: LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

               LT rushes in, triple bolts the DOOR behind him. He immediately 
               pulls the DRAPES.

               ARIANE walks away, speaks with her back to LT.

               LT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY 
               under it.

               LT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a 
               MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S 
               NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky

               LT makes the strangulation gesture again. ARIANE laughs at 
               him.

</b>                         Then c'mere. I got something for 
                         you.

               ARIANE pulls out a pristine NEEDLE.  LT comes but flinches 
               at the sight.

               Apparently BOWTAY overheard that drugs are on the way. BOWTAY 
               appears out of the KITCHEN.

               BOWTAY sits down near by, awaiting her DOSE.

               ARIANE starts preparing the DOSE. She's got all the 
               paraphernalia: SPOON. COTTON, a CANDLE FLAME, etc.

<b>                                     ARIANE

                         I'm gonna add some Downtown. They 
                         call this thing a speedball, honey, 
                         but then you must know that...

                         like that nun. And I'm gonna rape 
                         you.

               That decides it for LT. He sits down like a little boy and 
               lets ARIANE shoot him up with the potent mixture of COCAINE 
               and HEROIN.

               ARIANE shoots up BOWTAY, next.

               They do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic 
               connotations.

               When LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds, 
               sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there.

               Then he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES. 
               Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters.

               Then he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic.

               ARIANE LAUGHS at his antics.

               Finally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with 
               total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this --

               The PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes 
               who it may be. He slowly answers the phone.

               LT can hardly speak. He is NUDE, and communicating from 
               another world syllable by syllable.

               ARIANE LAUGHS, decides to go with it.

               LT, out of breath from his tirade, lets the Downtown half of 
               his dose kick in but good.

               He sits down in the same EASY CHAIR in which he nodded out 
               the morning of the desecration.

               Nodding out, he stares out the same WINDOW. His eyes close.

               VARIOUS ANGLES. The still-desecrated CHURCH in all its

               Suddenly --

               LT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the 
               white light of noon. For a moment, he watches her from a 
               distance.

               The NUN knows he is there. After a time, she gets up, goes 
               to the altar, kneels. As if waiting for him.

               LT staggers down the center aisle. He's carrying the CIGAR

               LT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar.

               ANGLE - The CHALICE is still missing.

               They are all alone. At the ALTAR, before the CRUCIFIX, LT 
               confronts the NUN face to face. The NUN holds her ROSARY

               LT finally speaks. He thinks she'll be turned on by his offer

                         where it ought to be. It's a holy 
                         thing, you know. A holy thing.

               The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN lets go of the CHALICE. Now LT holds 
               ten CHALICE in his hands, alone. He speaks as if entranced.

                         Let's go.

               Suddenly purposive, LT grabs the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN by the 
               arm. Starts pulling her out of the CHURCH. He holds the 
               CHALICE with the other arm, picks up the CIGAR BOX on his 
               way out. Manages to carry both items.

               When LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN reach the door to outside, 
               they both pause to GENUFLECT.

               Then LT grabs her again and they rush out.

               toward the FENCE'S SHOP.

               He still holds the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.

               PEOPLE watch them pass and make way. As if they realize that 
               something is happening -- on several levels at once. The 
               GAME has begun. It is on TV in every BAR and SHOP WINDOW. In

               POV LT - The GAME is playing on a couple dozen TV's in the 
               FENCE'S SHOP' The Mets are still losing!

               The FENCE, and elderly Black man, is sitting in one of many 
               EASY CHAIRS. He doesn't seem surprised to see his WIFE. Or

               The FENCE seems to study LT.

               POV FENCE - LT. Wretched.

               LT leaves. CHALICE in hand.

<b>               EXT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE STREETS IN THE BARRIO - MONTAGE
</b>
               LT stumbles through the streets, questioning people about 
               "JULIO and PAOLO". No one knows anything. LT stops people at 
               random, getting really desperate. He shows people the CHALICE, 
               asks them if they've seen it before. No one has.

               LT plays both ADDICT and COP as it suits his needs. By now, 
               he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. But 
               none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere.

               The GAME is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing.

               Finally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER. He cops. 
               The STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN, so the deal goes 
               down in mime.

               Now, LT speaks and wants to be heard.

<b>                                     LT
</b>                         Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio 
                         around?

               The STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting 
               "deafness" to excuse his total lack of response.

               LT starts MOUTHING WORDS silently at the STREET DEALER. No 
               response. Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout.

               The STREET DEALER's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at 
               all above the WALKMAN music. He moves the WALKMAN away from 
               his ears but doesn't take it off.

                         looked just like yours. And you look 
                         something like my Uncle. But one day 
                         he was standing in a puddle -- the 
                         puddle locked just like that one --

               LT points to a PUDDLE in which the STREET DEALER is now 
               Standing.

</b>                         And he got electrocuted.

               The STREET DEALER tries to consider what this crazy guy has 
               just told him, but before the STREET DEALER can even react. 
               LT leans in on him, shows his GUN and then his BADGE.

                         mood to kill someone today and you 
                         are at the end of my gun.

                         where I'm coming from.

                         Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ?

               The STREET DEALER answers with absolute ease. That was all 
               it was about? No problem.

                         probably still there now. It's next 
                         to the old Convent. Downtown a ways.

               CU. LT - It hits him. The CRACKHOUSE where the kids hang out 
               has always been right next to the CHURCH/CONVENT where it an 
               began! It suddenly makes sense to him.

               LT completes re transaction, pays the STREET DEALER for the 
               DRUG BAGS. He takes the CASH out of the CIGAR BOX, revealing 
               dozens of thousands of dollars.

               The STREET DEALER stares at the wretched man with a box full 
               of cash.

               In BARS, TV STORE WINDOWS, in snatches of strangers' 
               conversation, the FINAL GAME IS EVERYWHERE. The whole city 
               has stopped to watch it. LT is practically the only person 
               in the street.

               Worst of all, the Mets are seriously behind. They are 
               definitely LOSING.

               wear gold CROSSES. LT HANDCUFFS them.

               The other CRACKHEADS race out.

               There is even a TV in the CRACKHOUSE -- playing the GAME! 
               The SOUND is Off. The Mets keep losing. If anything will 
               force LT to kill/and or take the KIDS into custody, this

               LT sits down next to the KIDS. SMOKES with them, watches the 
               Game. LT must hold the PIPE for them, as they are HANDCUFFED.

               LT gets them super-high, and himself likewise. He still holds 
               his GUN.

               The KIDS go along with it. Taking it moment to moment.

               All three, despite the situation, are heavily into the Game.

               must do the same.

               The FINAL GAME (SEVEN) is on the RADIO. LT is listening, but 
               also not listening.

               LT talks wildly about Jesus Christ. And about the misery 
               they pass in the street. He waves his GUN wildly, punctuating 
               his speech with potentially lethal gestures. He aims the GUN 
               at JULIO and PAULO, then at himself, then out the window,

               The Mets are coming up from behind -- but it is a long shot. 
               LT doesn't seem to care. He stares into space.

<b>               EXT:/INT: EVENING - LTS CAR - THE PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL
</b>
               LT stops his CAR -- next to a BUS in an underground tunnel.

</b>                         Get out.

               The KIDS do. LT follows fast.

               AT THE BUS: He makes them board at GUN POINT.

</b>                         If you think you're not getting on 
                         this bus, you're dead wrong. No 
                         fucking way are you gonna miss this 
                         bus, man! You were probably the kind 
                         of kids who had your father drive 
                         you to school cause you couldn't 
                         catch the fucking bus. But no more, 
                         man. You're getting on this bus and 
                         you're taking it to the last fucking 
                         stop. So get on the fucking bus, 
                         man, 'cause you're life ain't worth 
                         shit in this town.

               LT uncuffs them and the KIDS get on the BUS, dumbstruck.

               LT hands JULIO the CIGAR BOX. His "salvation."

               The KIDS don't even know what is inside. They take it.

               LT gets back into his CAR, takes off.

               INT: STRAWBERRY is up. The GAME can go either way. Suspense.

               But not on the face of LT. He is dressed in the PURPLE ROBES, 
               the CHALICE beside him in the CAR.

               The BOOKIE pulls up and -- without getting out of his CAR -- 
               He SHOOTS LT in the head.

               The BOOKIE speeds off. (We never saw him behind the dark 
               windows,} LT is dead in his CAR.

               On the RADIO, the GAME is ending. STRAWBERRY hits a HOME RUN 
               and the -- Mets win, the CROWD ROARS.
