     CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET

</b>
     ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of
     control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.

     It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN
     THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.

     FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.

     POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
     a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...

     The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
     bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
     holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
     his body. His left holds a GUN!

     Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE
<b>     DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.
</b>
     A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
     burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the

     The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.     The
     Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!

     A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
     HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
     watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
     TONIC, is...

     DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
     charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
     trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
     The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.

     IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
     most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)

</b>                After a two month investigation, Det.
                Jason York has been relieved of duty
                for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge
                shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
                Curtis. Key testimony against York
                came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was
                on scene that night. The Seattle
                Police Department is handing this case
                over to the King County District
                Attorney's office. Criminal charges
                are expected.

     The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN
     MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.

<b>                          JENKINS
</b>                In a civilized society, the men and
                women entrusted with serving and
                protecting the community are to be held
                accountable just like everyone else.
                Simply put... Just because you are a
                cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to
                you. This is no longer the wild, wild
                west.

     A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms
     in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While

     PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED!     Lorenz is in
     COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.

     BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the
     counters! One on one side, one on the other.

     BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points
     them into the lobby!

     BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd
     level, forces them downstairs.

     From the corner of Lorenz's eye...      The SECURITY GUARD's hand
     creeps toward his gun.

     The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS
     the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard
     drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.

     Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to

      Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the
      watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't
      love, this is a relationship of convenience.

      Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one
      last check in the mirror...

      He places a VOICE MODULATOR over the phone's mouthpiece (this

     Callo arrives at the POLICE TECH VAN.    So state-of-the-art
     NASA is green with envy.

     BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on,

     Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his
     refrigerator, grabs a bottle of water. When he closes the
     door... He notices Jenkins and a YOUNG DETECTIVE on his
     deck.

     Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE
     SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes
     to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a

Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally
relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE

<b>                    JENKINS

Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND
WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE.

The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,
retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to

<b>                    DEKKER
</b>          Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory
          in the 1960's. It's the study of
          phenomena that appear random, but in
          fact have an element of regularity
          which can be described mathematically.

<b>                    CONNERS
</b>              (confused)
          Try that again?

<b>                    DEKKER
</b>          Pretty much... initial state of events
          may seem unrelated and random, but
          eventually patterns emerge and in the
          end all the pieces fit together.

The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check.

<b>                    CONNERS
</b>          Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's
          Dad and so on and so back?

Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.

Conners reaches his limit.      Time to put him in place.

      Richards races, checks the rearview mirror...      Dekker's Hog
      closing in.

      UP AHEAD...   The alley exits onto RICHARDS STREET.

      Richards approaches the mouth of the alley, just as A STREET
      CLEANER appears, starts to block the exit.

      Richards STAMPS ON THE ACCELERATOR, speeds through the small
      opening, just past the Street Cleaner!

      Dekker's not so lucky. Sees the Street Cleaner too late...

      CRASH! Conners, in a patrol car, plows into the rear of the
      truck, spinning it around.

      Dekker races towards the crash site.

      Conners climbs out of the car.

      Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from
      his mouth. He sees, through the windshield, Conners coming
      for him. He scrambles for his handgun, looks up to see
      Conners, but he's not there. Richards turns as...

          Two things jump out here. First, each

          This is not American National's. After

          Pacific Savings of Seattle.

<b>                    DEKKER
</b>          That sounds familiar.

<b>                    MARNIE
</b>          It should. Four months ago, a half
          million dollars was stolen in an armed
          robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab
          job. They caught the guys a day later,
          recovering about $400,000. Those guys
          have been in lock up since and their
          trial's still pending. Which leads us
          to point number two. Do you smell
          that?

<b>                    DEKKER
</b>              (smells the bills; grimaces)
          What is it?

<b>                    MARNIE
</b>          When evidence is taken in, any physical
          contact might affect the ability to
          lift prints, so, to mark it, we now

</b>               One day the Buddha found his heart in

               to the earth, to the base of a great
               tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
               elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
               doesn't like seeing him discouraged.

      An EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, 30's, attends to Dekker's

      HANDCUFFS lock Richards to his bed. Richards is hooked up to
      an IV and a tube's up his nose. A HEART RATE MONITOR chimes
      rhythmically.

      Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS look on as Conners and Dekker enter.

      leans over Richards.

       From a nearby medicine cabinet, Dekker rummages around.

<b>                            DEKKER
</b>                  I was skiing about three years ago.
                  Aspen. Beautiful country. Ever been?
                  Never mind. I hit a mogul, landed on a
                  sheet of ice and slammed into a tree.
                  Broke myself up pretty bad. Kinda like
                  you did today. I was in a hospital bed
                  for three months. Had it not been
                  for... Here it is.
                      (he finds)
                  Morphine. Without this stuff, I
                  wouldn't have made it.

       Dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.

<b>                            DEKKER
</b>                  Now this IV drip administers a small
                  dosage every minute. Makes you feel
                  relaxed and calm. No pain. But...

       Dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the IV bag.

<b>                            DEKKER
</b>                  If I were to inject this whole thing...

</b>                  You don't have the balls.

       Dekker PRESSES down on the syringe, just a little, but enough
       to go into the bag. Richards can't believe it.

<b>                            DEKKER
</b>                  This equipment malfunctions all the

                  Besides, I don't think the DA's going
                  to launch a full-scale investigation
                  over a scum like you.

       Richards attempts to signal for a nurse, but Dekker pulls the
       call button away.

       Dekker SQUEEZES in some more, until...   Richards gives in,
       signals that he'll talk.

</b>          These are today's transaction records

          from all the accounts and deposits it
          into the bad guys' account. If you
          check the transactions, no two
          withdrawal amounts are the same and
          none of'em are over $100. Most
          security systems work on the size of
          the money, not number of transactions.
          Wire out one million from a handful of
          accounts and red flags go up. Wire out
          a less than a hundred from ten million

</b>                 Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from
                 any bank doesn't usually go into affect
                 until the next business day. So it's
                 going to keep jumping around until it

                 break in? If they're just wiring

<b>                           YORK
</b>                 I have come this far...      I will not be
                 denied.

      Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind
      York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two!

      Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.

      York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking.

      Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!

      York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!
      He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...

      ... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his
      chest... POPS out his back!

      York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker.
      Then go dead.

      Dekker steps close.   Holds a cold, remorseless stare at
      York's body.

       Dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. He
       rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. All to no avail.

       That's when he finds... a medium-sized paperback, dog-eared
       and worn. The title of the book... "CHAOS" by James Gleick.
