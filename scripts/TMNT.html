              hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see-

              up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her.

              It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...

              hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
              doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
               ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.

              The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
              all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
              and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by

               SLIDES down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage
               like he's a human bowling ball.
               ON HEAD OF ALLEY - The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a

               And then he stops. Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates.

          attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this
          opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks
          back at the Turtles...

          not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below!
           aph tries to turn the tables and attacks the Creature! The
          boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper
          trouble.
          The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact.
          The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many
          flights of floors.
          Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the
          building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom
          floor to await the others.
          SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.

          Turtles are buried under the rubble.
          RUH? - The Creature is confused... until it's hit with a
          blinding light, and then an EXPLOSION - FWOOM! We hear heavy
          footsteps thumping through the light. Shapes start to form
          until we see...
          ...LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH
          TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings.
          Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through
          their stone cracks and piercing eyes.
          The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape-
          themed costume ("MONO"), Eagle Leader ("AGUILA"), agile
          Jaguar ("GATO") and the deadly snake-like female

          the lion. He reaches to a satchel on the floor. The Foot
          TENSE in anticipation. Instead... Winters comes up with a

          air. Winters STOPS and looks back over his shoulder.

          Winters throat!
          ...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH.
          Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the
          shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS.
          They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of
          it all.
          The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and
          unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.

                    Are we cool?
          ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably
          seething inside. Winters is flanked by Generals.

          CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is
          wheeled into the light.
          Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
          pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the
          HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.

                    So it begins...
          It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.
          Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw.
          Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He
          merely grins at the creature.

                    Were there any problems?
          AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over
          Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.

<b>                              GENERAL AGUILA

                    You two should compare notes.
          Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not
          used to being handled like this.

                    I now have the power and know-how,
                    but I need the speed and stealth of
                    an organization such as your own.
                    Not to mention an organization that
                    values discretion.

<b>                              KARAI
</b>                    But of course.

<b>                              WINTERS
</b>                    You see, I have nine more beasts
                    like this that should be coming to
                    town very soon. Thirteen in all, to
                    be exact.
          The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the
          floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see
          the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.

                        (looks off, distant)
                    And they recognize something
                    familiar in the air... in the
                    stars.

<b>                        (BEAT)
</b>                    What can I say? I'm a lover of
                    animals.
          The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some
          cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor. Filled
          by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad

<b>                               W

                    nice.
          The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door.
          They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand.

               Three brothers sit around their breakfast table, looking hung
               over from the previous night's brawl. Mikey comes in, looking
               the worst of all, and plops into his seat. Cam circles table.

               A BASEBALL BAT and his CLASSIC WHITE HOCKEY MASK!

          swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General.

               He's taking a pounding as the door is denting with each slam
               by Gato. Casey tries to help as well.

</b>               Night reaches an area that's a DEAD END. One side of the
               buildings has a LARGE LETTERED SIGN facing away. Fills the
               rooftop with silhouettes. No choice but to turn around...
               ...as Leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building.

               INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear
               Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him.

                    this vigilante nonsense.

                    Okay, Leo. Wanna play?
          Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with
          expertise... then motions for Leo to fight. Charge at each
          other, running through the rain, weapons drawn.
          They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it
          out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline.
          There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks.
          Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn.

          ...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding.
          Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD.
          Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control,
          restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under
          Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante.

               Raph stops in his tracks. Reaches behind his back... and
               pulls out his TWIN SAIS. He flips them to the front.

               Leo just can't believe that Raph bested him. They pant
               heavily. The rain dies down.
               Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few rooftops. Away from his brother.

               to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to fight

               Splinter is. Same with April, who squares off against Karai.
               They fight hard. April ends up cornered, about to be skewered
               by her blade when...

               Casey is enjoying the hell out of it. High flying, adrenaline

          everywhere! They slam into the walls like shrapnel.
          ON FOOT - As they dive out of the way. One gets hit with a
          dart in the chest. Looks down. Passes out.

          something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van!
          Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling
          back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the
          creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end

          Raph grins. They stand, backs to back... finally as a TEAM.
          They trust one another, and their efficiency shows.
          ON PORTAL - More tentacles begin to come out. More claws
          surround the surface edges.
          ON TMNT - The music swells. The brothers act and think as
          one. The way they should. They way they will from now on.
          ON SPLINTER - As cam PUSHES IN, he stands up. Seeing his
          sons. As one. As BROTHERS. He smiles.

          The Generals can't keep up. It's enough to distract them to
          make mistakes the TMNT take advantage of.
          ON WINTERS - Sees the portal light beginning to SHRINK!
          Because of the TMNT's moves, the Generals are now on the
          precipice of the Portal, being pulled back. They struggle to
          stand.
          The brothers look at each other. The place is violent with a

          The   TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch
          and   take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into
          the   PORTAL! They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils
          and   pulled back!
          The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal.

          as the vehicle spins out of the path.

          ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle.
          ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get

                Splinter walks through the lair. It's empty. He walks past
                their "trophy room". He places the ornate head of WINTERS'
                CANE on the shelf.

                          it's more than sharing a roof or a
                          bathroom. It's sharing life... My
                          father taught me that, and I think
                          it's pretty much true... y'know,
                          provided that you don't kill each
                          other in the process. Or that no
                          one touches your stuff. Or makes
                          loud noises when you're trying to
                          sleep. Or...
