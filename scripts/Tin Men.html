</b>    BILL BABOWSKY ("BB"), a wiry, dapper-looking man in his
    mid-thirties, is circling a baby blue Cadillac. A
    SALESMAN follows on his heels.

</b>               I thought maybe you saw some chick
               walking by. I lost my concentration.
               Why do they call cars 'she'? They
               never say 'he'... always 'she.'
    The Salesman shrugs his shoulders.      BB walks around the
    Cadillac.
<b>                             BB
</b>               Very nice... very nice.

</b>    Tilley's leaving the house with his tie undone around
    his white on white shirt. He carries his sports jacket,
    and Nora is standing at the door yelling at him.

              unconditional apology.
    Tilley walks down the steps of the house and goes to his
    car -- a Cadillac. He gets inside, STARTS the ENGINE and
    pulls away. Nora remains on the porch watching the car
    ... one lonely figure in a neighborhood of hundreds of
    duplicate houses.

     a place in the   lot where there's some room to fight. The

     is so nearby.

     He grabs Nora's shoes and throws them out onto the
     street. Then he goes into the bathroom and piles all of
     her toiletries in his arms, tosses them into a trash can.
     Takes a suitcase from a shelf in the bedroom, opens it,
     throws in the trash can. He clears out her underwear
     drawers and empties them into the suitcase, closes the
     suitcase and then throws that out of the window. He's
     out of breath, exhausted and sweating. He goes down-
     stairs into the kitchen to get himself a drink. He
     sees a pair of Nora's slippers under the kitchen table,
     he picks them up, opens the back door and tosses them
     outside. Locks the door. He stands there as if a
     motor is running inside of him. Walks out of the

                boiled eggs do you take them out
                of the shell or leave them in the

                it's not good... and you get

                the greatest ass I ever saw in my

                think I'm being too picky... at
                least once if they talked about

      shot. He carefully strokes the pool cue between his
      fingers, hits the ball, and sinks the shot. He moves
      around the table -- he has a particularly complicated
      shot.

      ball goes or doesn't. BB lines up the shot; he shoots,
      and it misses, hanging up on the lip of the pocket.

      with four hits into the stomach, really fast, and one hit
      to Tilley's head. Tilley falls into the rack of pool
      cues, they all fall to the ground. BB goes to jump on

      a hand free and hits Tilley hard in the side of the

      commissioners are behind a long table, led by John
      Masters, there is a gallery of observers, and Tilley
      sits at the defense table across from the commissioners.

</b>                  I'm not aware of the section
                  numbers. Sometimes you get a
                  little overzealous in the heat of
                  the sales pitch, that's all.
      BB is watching the proceedings.      CAMERA HOLDS ON him.
<b>                                MASTERS (O.S.)
</b>                  Was it the heat of the sales pitch
                  on February 23rd of this year that
                  made you write across a contract
                  'This Job Is Free'?


<b>      ON TILLEY
</b>      who is falling apart.
<b>                                TILLEY
</b>                  As I remember, no sale was made
                  concerning those customers.
<b>                                MASTERS
</b>                  It fell out because a loan couldn't
                  be arranged, but the people did
                  agree in principle.
                         (beat)
                  The point that we'd like to stress,
                  is that you misled these people.
                  Told them the job was free. Then
                  you sent in your closer with some
                  cover story about how you had
                  suffered a nervous breakdown, and
                  a sale was ultimately made for
                  twenty-three hundred and seventy-
                  seven dollars. That is misleading
                  and deceptive sales practice.
<b>                                   TILLEY
</b>                  It was    temporary insanity. I
                  don't    know... it just came over me
                  ... it    might have been something
                  I ate.     I don't know... it was
                  crazy,    I'm the first to admit it

<b>154   EXT. STREET - LONG TELEPHOTO SHOT OF CITY - DAY               154
</b>      showing stacks of houses as the Cadillac drives away.
      A MacDonald golden arch is being put in place by a crane
      on the horizon line. It's almost as if it's a rainbow
      across the far side of town, and the Cadillac will drive
      through it.

                It's just a matter of time.
