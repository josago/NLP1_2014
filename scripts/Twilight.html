</b>          Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither 
          bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near. 
<b>          
</b>          Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping. 
          Abruptly, we're on the move. Fast.

          are dodged with preternatural agility. And we're speeding
          up, chasing something. It's exhilarating. Terrifying. 
          Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey -

          a forest. It sprints forward, but we gain on it. Beyond the deer, 
          SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the
          trees. The buck races for the light. We're just behind it, 
          about to emerge from the shadowy darkness -

</b><b>          
</b>          The deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle,

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          BELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's
          low rent for this ritzy neighborhood. Rene is eclectic, 
          scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent. She 
          thrusts a cell phone at Bella. 
<b>          
</b><b>

</b>          PHIL, 31, good looking with an athlete's body, exits the
          house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          PHIL

<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          He puts his Phoenix Desert Dogs baseball hat on Rene's head with 
          a
          kiss. Phil's love of Rene reassures Bella. Phil heads to the old
          station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm 
          through Bella's, clinging to her as they walk to car.
<b>

          wherever the game is. 
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great 
          sacrifice that would be. Bella forces a smile.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          BELLA
</b>          I won't change my mind, mom.

</b><b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          BELLA
</b>          It's not about Forks, it's about

<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          But as Rene hugs Bella, we see the truth on BELLA'S FACE 
          dread, doubt, regret. Off Bella, struggling to keep her 
          facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car..

</b>          The McMansions get smaller as we SWEEP OVER the scorched

          past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns to

</b>          It's neater, rearranged more attractively. Clearly, Bella's
          given it her touch. She sweeps through, folding Charlie's
          fleece jacket, straightening up. She grabs her book bag

</b>          ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay
          filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of
          puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight.

</b>          Great. 
          WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her 
          truck. 
<b>          BELLA
</b>          Dad, I can drive myself to school.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's 
          watching her -

</b><b>          UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE TREES 
</b>          --tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on 
          a

</b><b>          
</b>          patch of ice -
<b>          -
</b>          BACK ON BELLA - fallen on her ass. Charlie climbs out of the

<b>          CHARLIE
</b>          You okay, Bells?
<b>          BELLA
</b>          Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.

          heads inside. Bella looks at the tires again, oddly moved..

</b>          Bella straightens, girding herself. Then strides to the

</b>          Feeling like an idiot, she quickly sits. He abruptly moves to

          in, adjusting the lens. She's curt as she addresses him.

</b>          He writes it on the worksheet. Then he takes a breath, as if 
          trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort.

          seems more intrigued than agonized. He studies her. She still 
          can't tell if he despises her or not. It's infuriating.

          climb in. A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks toward the 
          sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER..

</b><b>          
</b>          Bella turns to see a VAN -- skidding on the ice, careening out of 
          control, heading directly for her. TIME suddenly fractures, 
          compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as

          --THE VAN DRIVER'S FACE -TYLER, desperately trying to gain
          control, then shielding his face.
          -- EDWARD'S FACE - looking at Bella with horror..
<b>          . 
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          THE VAN is about to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in 
          between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning 
          her to the ground. She looks up - Edward is on top of her. 
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The world around them FREEZES -- in this fraction of 
          a 
          second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying. He 
          breathes in her scent, she takes in his flawless face..

          quickly, we, and Bella, are unsure what's going on:
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          -- THE VAN SMASHES into the back of Bella's truck 
<b>          -
</b>          -- Then SPINS around, once again careening toward her and 
          Edward, then suddenly 
<b>          -
</b>          --EDWARD'S HANDS are creating a deep dent in the side of the
          van's body as it shudders to a stop, a foot from Bella. 
          -- Edward literally pushes the van away.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Then silence. A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at 
          Edward, trying to absorb what just happened. Edward's fear for
          her is still alive on his face. She starts to speak but..
<b>          .
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help. People leap to 
          Tyler's aid, run to Bella and Edward. Bella SEES the onion on the
          ground, smashed as she would have been. As everyone sweeps in, 
          Edward moves into the b.g. Mike and Eric run to Bella

</b>          Amid the chaos, Bella sees EDWARD'S SIBLINGS looking at

          Instead, they look at him with disapproval... and fury.

</b>          Mr. Molina and a Tour Guide lead several dozen kids through 
          the greenhouse. Bella keeps an eye on Edward who's up ahead
          with Alice and Jasper. Mr. Molina demonstrates the compost 
          machine as the students mess around.

          down deep... that's it..

</b>          (the machine gurgles and spins)
          ... now Tyler, take a big steaming 
          cup of “compost tea.” This is 
          recycling at its most basic level -

          alone, she takes a breath for courage and strides up to him.

</b>          Hello, Edward.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          He glances at her, merely nodding. We notice his FISTS clench, 
          and unclench. Bella looks at him, appalled by his rudeness.
<b>          
</b><b>

</b>          Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing 
          Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it. 
          Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic
          in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off. 
          As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him.

</b>          Based on what someone decides. And 
          I've decided.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          He looks at her, angry. 
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EDWARD
</b>          Is that what you dream about? 
          Becoming a monster? 
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          BELLA
</b>          I dream about being with you forever. 
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EDWARD
</b>          You really want this?
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          BELLA
</b>          Yes.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          He lowers his lips to her neck. One bite is all it would take. 
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          103.
</b><b>          EDWARD
</b>          You're ready right now?
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          BELLA
</b>          Yes.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          His lips hover over her skin, a long beat... then he presses his 
          lips to her throat. Not a bite. A kiss. He looks at her.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EDWARD
</b>          You're going to have a long and 
          happy life with me. Isn't that 
          enough?
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          She looks at him... and finally smiles.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          BELLA
</b>          For now.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          They WHIRL around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from 
          one another, as we CRANE UP on them, in each other's arms..
<b>          .
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          BELLA (V.O.)
</b>          No one will surrender tonight. But 
          I won't give in. I know what I want.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          CONTINUE UP AND BACK on the dance floor. We realize ..
<b>          
</b>          ... someone's watching it, looking down from the window of 
          a second floor hotel room in the Inn. The MUSIC wafting up in 
          echoes. PULL BACK to REVEAL..
<b>          
</b>          VICTORIA, turning from the window. She's stylishly dressed
          now, but seething -- a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her 
          throat. PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES 
          filled with vengeance as we 
<b>          -
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SMASH TO BLACK.
