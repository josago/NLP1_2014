    Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad
    attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver,
    cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out
    his cell and dials.

    Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who
    clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing
    off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.

    Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts.
    She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing
    volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from

    immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.

     He puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at
     the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly
     opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack
     and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the
     other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and
     spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop
     the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is

      Suddenly, Slater guns it and speeds across the lot, slamming
      the breaks, spinning wildly in several erratic donuts
      backward donuts.

      Slater completely loses control of the car. He smashes
      through a bunch of shopping carts and slams into a light
      post, completely fucking up the cruiser.

      Slater tries to open his door, but it won't budge. He crawls
