</b><b>          
</b>          1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is
          preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark-
          haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate
          quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom
          to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an
          egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a
          sparkling clean plate.
<b>          
</b>          MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the
          sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can,
          turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and
          BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The
          credits end.
<b>

</b><b>                              BRIGITTE
</b>                    You let me sleep because you can't
                    bear to have breakfast with me.
<b>          
</b>          It's half-serious. MICHAEL doesn't react.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    Nothing could be further from the
                    truth. I boiled you an egg. See?
<b>          
</b>          MICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from
          nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    I'd hardly have boiled you an egg
                    if I didn't want to see you. Tea or
                    coffee?
<b>          
</b>          BRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing
          gown. She's still half-serious.

                    goes on in your head?
<b>          
</b>          MICHAEL smiles to himself.

</b>          He closes the door, then turns to the open door of the
          bedroom. He looks at the mess of last night's love-making.
          Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn
          goes by.

</b>          December 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is
          in a well-cut suit he's inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone
          shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his
          face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He's plainly feeling ill.

</b>          1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the
          street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway
          leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to
          get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a
          wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS
          walks past.

</b><b>          
</b>          MICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand
          over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the
          pavement and seizes him by the arm.

</b>          HANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties.
          She disappears. He's sick again. She reappears with a bucket
          of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down
          with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket.

<b>          
</b>          Effortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his
          head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly
          he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head.

</b>          HANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted
          with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his
          satchel, she is pulling him by the arm.

</b>          They come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops
          outside his block, as if nervous she might come in.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MICHAEL

<b>          
</b>          MICHAEL smiles `Thank you' and goes in. HANNA is left alone.
          She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping
          uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came.
          MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision.

</b>          CARLA BERG is at the stove in the kitchen. She takes dinner
          through for the BERG family, at a round table in a
          traditional apartment, under a five-candled brass chandelier.

</b>          MICHAEL'S father, PETER, is a balding, abstracted man, eating

          MICHAEL has his book in front of him, not touching his food.

          turns. It's EMILY. But at once CARLA's arm pulls her away.

          green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a
          sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment.
          Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red
          flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at him a

          There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the

          cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she
          irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and
          puts it over one of the chairs.

</b>          HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with
          the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers.
          He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks
          broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She
          puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she
          upends the iron.

</b>          MICHAEL goes out into the hall. The kitchen door is slightly
          open. HANNA takes off her smock and stands in a green slip.
          Her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair.

          knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the
          other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches,
          riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put
          the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her
          dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he
          blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door
          slams.

          The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He   waits for them to

          poured in from the street. He goes down to the bottom, and
          picks up a bucket. He digs in to the coke, and at once it
          comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.

</b>          HANNA opens the tap. There's a boiler, and steaming hot water
          comes out. MICHAEL takes off his sweater, then stops.

</b>          HANNA takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. He

<b>          
</b>          On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him.
          MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He
          gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he
          submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out
          in the open air.

</b>          MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes
          back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out,
          turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his
          body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts
          her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He
          turns and faces her.

<b>          
</b>          At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL
          goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time,
          she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his
          eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand
          over his mouth to smother the noise.

          come in. There are cries of `Here they come'. Then the

</b>          Not far from MICHAEL, a GIRL sits across the aisle, virginal
          with brown hair, brown summer skin.

</b>                    Everyone believes that Homer's
                    subject is homecoming. In fact, The
                    Odyssey is a book about a journey.
                    Home is a place you dream of, it's
                    not a place you ever attain.

</b>          He looks SOPHIE straight in the eye. There is a sudden

          down. Then MICHAEL moves slightly to pack up his stuff.

                    Remember, there've been no
                    significant trials between
                    Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz

                    don't. They operate by something
                    called law. You're not guilty of

                    sixty inmates were selected. They
                    were picked out to be sent from the

          impassive. But HANNA follows her own thoughts. She quietly
          asks herself a question.

          composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. ROSE and
          ILANA MATHER. They look up, catching MICHAEL's eye. Then a

          sound of the trial. He opens the door fully. MICHAEL can see
          that it is ILANA who is testifying. The court is
          conspicuously packed. Large black-and-white photographs of
          the labour camp now dominate the room. MICHAEL comes quietly
          into the back of the room as the trial goes on.
<b>          
</b>          MICHAEL has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near
          ROSE who is sitting in the body of the court. He looks across
          to the DEFENDANTS. RITA BECKHART, a large older woman, is one
          of a couple who isn't bothering to listen.

                    gave them food and places to sleep.
                    In the evening, she asked them to

                    camp was closed down, we were told

                    Half of us died on the march. My

                    the best quarters, they took the
                    priest's house. But they let us
                    sleep in a church. There was a
                    bombing raid. In the middle of the
                    night. At first we could only hear
                    the fire, it was in the steeple.
                    Then we could see burning beams,
                    and they began to crash to the
                    floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to
                    the doors. But the doors had been
                    locked on the outside.

                       women. Because they were panicking,
                       they were screaming. I couldn't
                       stand it. I couldn't stand their
                       screaming. I was more frightened of
                       the other women than I was of the
                       fire. So I too my daughter and led
                       her to the upper floor. I can't
                       defend what I did. It's impossible
                       to defend. I took Ilana in my arms
                       and I led her towards the fire.
                       There was a small gallery at the
                       side of the church on the upper
                       level. It saved our lives. The

          The end of a hard day's work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over
          the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went
          cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content.

          She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table.
          Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up.

</b>          From the far end of the corridor, MICHAEL is seen sitting on
          a bench. MS BRENNER comes out of her office and murmurs in
          his ear. MICHAEL is seen nodding, ashen.

          the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The
          books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table,
          a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the
          door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed
          bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    She didn't pack. She never intended
                    to leave.
<b>          
</b>          MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the
          two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the
          cassette machine.
<b>          
</b>          Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from
          magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees.
          One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL
          kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations,
          articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish
          handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through
          the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the
          young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school
          principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school
          literature prize.'
<b>          
</b>          MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she
          sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet
          of paper from her suit pocket.

                    will. I'll read out the bit that
                    concerns you.
<b>

</b>          ILANA lifts the tin.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ILANA
</b>                    When I was a little girl, I had a
                    tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite
                    like this. It had Cyrillic
                    lettering. I took it with me to the
                    camp, but it got stolen.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    What was in it?
<b>          
</b><b>                              ILANA
</b>                    Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of
                    hair from our dog. Some tickets to
                    operas my father had taken me to.
                    It wasn't stolen for its contents.
                    It was the tin itself which was
                    valuable, what you could do with
                    it.
<b>          
</b>          She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ILANA
</b>                    There's nothing I can do with this
                    money. If I give it to anything
                    associated with the extermination
                    of the Jews, then to me it will
                    seem like absolution and that is
                    something I'm neither willing nor
                    in a position to grant.
<b>          
</b>          MICHAEL nods slightly.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  80.

</b><b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    I was thinking maybe an
                    organization to encourage literacy.
<b>          
</b><b>                                ILANA
</b>                    Good.
<b>          
</b>          There's a silence.
<b>          
</b><b>                                ILANA
</b>                    Good.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    Do you know if there's a Jewish
                    organization?
<b>          
</b><b>                              ILANA
</b>                    I'll be surprised if there isn't.
                    There's a Jewish organisation for
                    everything. Not that illiteracy is
                    a very Jewish problem.
<b>          
</b>          There is the shadow of a smile.
<b>          
</b><b>                               ILANA
</b>                    Why don't you find out? Send them
                    the money.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                    Shall I do it in Hanna's name?
<b>          
</b><b>                              ILANA
</b>                    As you think fit.
<b>          
</b>          ILANA smiles slightly. She puts her hand on top of the tin.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ILANA
</b>                    I'll keep the tin.

</b><b>          INT. ILANA'S HOUSE. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          ILANA is standing at the window watching down to the street
          where MICHAEL is walking away. She has the tin in her hand.
          When he's vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom.
          There on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of ILANA
          with her mother in Germany before the war. She sets the tin
          down beside the photo.

</b><b>          INT & EXT. CAR. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          1995. MICHAEL is driving JULIA in the big Mercedes through
          the German countryside. He is tense, silent. JULIA takes a
          sideways look at him, but he does not respond.

</b><b>          
</b>          They draw up at a church. It is the same one he and HANNA
          passed on their bicycles years before. MICHAEL and JULIA get
          out and walk towards the graveyard at the side.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          MICHAEL & JULIA stand at a deserted grave-side. The whole
          cemetery is seen. MICHAEL stoops down and uncovers a simple
          stone : HANNA SCHMITZ 1923-1988. JULIA watching, says her
          name.

</b>          JULIA waits a moment.

<b>          
</b>          JULIA looks, waiting. MICHAEL looks for a moment as if he
          will not go on.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JULIA

</b>          There is a moment, then they turn to stroll, MICHAEL talking,
          starting to tell the story.
