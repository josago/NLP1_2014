               FULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH Grainy but unmistakably a man and 
               woman making love. Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING 
               in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, 
               MORE compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.

<b>                                     CURLY'S VOICE
</b>                              (crying out)
                         Oh, no.

<b>               INT. GITTES' OFFICE
</b>
               CURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over 
               GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his 
               breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes' 
               shiny desk top.

               Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at 
               it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite 
               the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a 
               cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on his desk.

               Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist 
               into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts 
               to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left 
               a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos 
               of several movie stars askew.

               Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He 
               is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually 
               bites into the blinds.

               Gittes doesn't move from his chair.

</b>                         All right, enough is enough. You 
                         can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. 
                         I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.

               Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes 
               reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly 
               selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of 
               more expensive whiskeys.

               Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his 
               desk toward Curly.

               Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. 
               He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry 
               quietly.

</b>                              (drinking, relaxing a 
                              little)
                         She's just no good.

</b>                         What can I tell you, Kid? You're 
                         right. When you're right, you're 
                         right, and you're right.

</b>                         Ain't worth thinking about.

               Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly.

                         give her another thought.

                         You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I 
                         know it's your job, but you're okay.

                              easier)

               Noticeably less plush than Gitte's. A well-groomed, dark-
               haired WOMAN sits nervously between their two desks, fiddling 
               with the veil on her pillbox hat.

                              the bereaved)
                         If you'll allow us to complete our 
                         preliminary questioning, by then 
                         he'll be free.

               There is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes' Office.

               Something made of glass shatters. The Woman grows more edgy.

               Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring 
               contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over 
               him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of 
               perspiration on his desk.

                         They don't kill a guy for that.

<b>                                     GITTES
</b>                         Oh they don't?

</b>                         Not for your wife. That's the 
                         unwritten law.

               Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting;

<b>                                     GITTES
</b>                         I'll tell you the unwritten law, you 
                         dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be 
                         rich to kill somebody, anybody and 
                         get away with it. You think you got 
                         that kind of dough, you think you 
                         got that kind of class?

               Curly shrinks back a little.

                         even pay me off.

               This seems to upset Curly even more.

                         San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, 
                         they don't pay you for skipjack the

                              his office)
                         Forget it. I only mention it to

               He's now walking him past SOPHIE who pointedly averts her 
               gaze. He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be 
               read: "J. J. GITTES and Associates. DISCREET INVESTIGATION"

               He throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile.

                         Curly.

               He shuts the door on him and the smile disappears.

               He shakes his head, starting to swear under his breath.

               Gittes nods, walks on in.

               Walsh rises when Gittes enters.

               Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic 
               smile.

                         the problem?

               She holds her breath. The revelation isn't easy for her.

<b>                                     MRS. MULWRAY
</b>                         My husband, I believe, is seeing 
                         another woman.

               Gittes looks mildly shocked. He turns for confirmation to 
               his two partners.

<b>                                     GITTES

</b>                         I am sorry.

               Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between 
               Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.

               Gittes gives him an irritated glance. Duffy stops chewing.

                         point they're going to assist me. I 
                         can't do everything myself.

               Mrs. Mulwray hesitates. She seems uncommonly nervous at the 
               question.

               Her intensity is genuine. Gittes looks to his two partners.

               Mrs. Mulwray nods, almost shyly. Gittes is now casually but 
               carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs. Mulwray's dress 
               â€“ her handbag, shoes, etc.

               Gittes' glance tells Duffy Gittes wants to do the questioning. 
               Mrs. Mulwray nods.

                         streetcar and in twenty-five minutes 
                         end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

                         can't drink it, you can't water your 
                         lawns with it, you can't irrigate an 
                         orange grove with it.  Remember we 
                         live next door to the ocean but we 
                         also live on the edge of the desert. 
                         Los Angeles is a desert community. 
                         Beneath this building, beneath every

               Walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in 
               his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising 
               fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The

</b>                         In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, 
                         over five hundred lives were lost 
                         when the Van der Lip Dam gave way 
                         core samples have shown that beneath 
                         this bedrock is shale similar to the 
                         permeable shale in the Van der Lip 
                         disaster.  It couldn't withstand 
                         that kind of pressure there.
                              (referring to a new 
                              overleaf)
                         Now you propose yet another dirt 
                         banked terminus dam with slopes of 
                         two and one half to one, one hundred 
                         twelve feet high and a twelve thousand 
                         acre water surface. Well, it won't 
                         hold. I won't build it. It's that 
                         simple. I am not making that kind of 
                         mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.

               Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly 
               there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the 
               chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny, 
               bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion.

               Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations 
               of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the 
               farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to 
               bodily attack Mulwray.

               It's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks. 
               Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked 
               with weeds.

               After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood 
               control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray 
               gets out of the car. Me looks around.

               Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the 
               flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover. 
               He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of 
               the riverbed.

               There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at 
               the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.

<b>               GITTES

               Trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's 
               glasses.

<b>               BELOW GITTES
</b>
               There's the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping. 
               Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into 
               the riverbed, and into Gitte's view.

<b>               MULWRAY
</b>
               Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power 
               lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water 
               at his feet.

               He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, 
               toward Gittes.

<b>               GITTES
</b>
               Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in 
               the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the 
               muddy banks.

               Mulwray says something to the boy.

               The boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground. 
               The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud 
               and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it.

               After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly 
               back upstream â€“ scrambling up the bank to his car.

               There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of 
               blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the 
               hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking 
               downstream from time to time.

               The power lines overhead HUM.

               He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets 
               back in the car. He drives off.

<b>               GITTES
</b>
               Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right 
               back out.

               The steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back 
               seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in 
               and takes off.

<b>               POINT FERMIN PARK â€“ DUSK

               Street lights go on.

<b>               MULWRAY
</b>
               Pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park 
               lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.

<b>               GITTES
</b>
               Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in 
               the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through the trees 
               in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of 
               the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes 
               moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating 
               the climb than Mulwray did.

<b>               DOWN ON THE BEACH
</b>
               Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear 
               crescent.

               He looks to his left. There's a promontory of sorts. It's 
               apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then 
               moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in 
               order to be above Mulwray.

<b>               AT THE OUTFALL
</b>
               Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand.

               Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it. Looks 
               absently up toward Gittes.

<b>               GITTES

               Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.

               of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.

<b>               MULWRAY
</b>
               Below him in watching the water trickling down from the 
               outfall near Gittes.

               Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated. 
               Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and 
               velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading 
               into the sea, whipping it into a foam.

<b>               AT THE STREET â€“ GITTES' CAR
</b>
               There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper. 
               Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash 
               light. It says:

<b>               "SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR

               crumples it up and tosses it out the window. He notices other 
               flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street.

               one.

               He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch. 
               It's 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray's car and places it behind 
               the front wheel of Mulwray's car. He yawns again and heads

               Gittes drops it, sits down. Walsh comes in carrying a series 
               of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard.

               Walsh shows him the photos. He looks at them. They are a 
               series outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man 
               whose appearance is striking. In two of the photos a gnarled 
               cane is visible.

                         Duffy, where are you?

               Duffy's VOICE can be HEARD, excitedly. "I got it. I got it. 
               He's found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat, in

               Duffy is rowing, Gittes seated in the stern.

               They pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print 
               dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly doting on 
               the girl.

                         Let's have a big smile, pal.

               He shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast 
               shots.

               Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them.

               Turns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl, Gittes 
               again clicking off several fast shots.

               MOVE ALONG the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of 
               the roof where Gittes' feet are hooked over the apex of the 
               roof and Gittes himself is stretched face downward on the 
               tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below 
               him where the girl and Mulwray are eating. Gittes is clicking 
               off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come 
               loose.

               Gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the 
               roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. He tries to 
               slow himself down. The loose tile also begins to slide.

               Gittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm drain 
               and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his 
               feet in the drain itself. The loose tile falls and hits the 
               veranda below. He stops as it's about to slide over the edge. 
               He carefully lays it in the drain. But a fragment off the 
               cracked edge of the tile falls.

               Mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet. He looks to the 
               girl.

               He's clearly concerned. He rises, looks up to the roof.

<b>               FROM HIS POV
</b>
               The roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. He slowly 
               sits back down, staring at the tile fragment.

               In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart-

               In b.g., customers can be OVERHEARD talking about the drought.

               Interspersed with above, someone is saying, "They're gonna

               "Only for washing your cars." Third says, "You're not going

               Gittes has been staring outside the barbershop. A car is

                         stop again and they contemplate the 
                         moon or something and it makes it 
                         more exciting. So this other guy 
                         goes home to screw his wife and after 
                         a while he stops and gets up and 
                         goes into the other room only he 
                         reads Life Magazine and he goes back 
                         and he screws some more and suddenly 
                         says excuse me a second and he gets 
                         up and smokes a cigarette and he 
                         goes back and by this time his wife 
                         is getting sore as hell. So he screws 
                         some more and then he gets up to 
                         look at the moon and his wife says, 
                         'What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?
                              (Gittes breaks up)
                         ...you're screwing like a Chinaman.'

               Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off. The 
               little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks up he sees 
               the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties. She's so 
               stunning that Gittes nearly gasps.

               Gittes is staggered. He glances down at the newspaper.

               She's walked past him toward the door. He stop her.

               Evelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her. This 
               time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come 
               out of his office and up behind him.

               Gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons 
               and complaint. Evelyn walks out the door.

               On Gittes' desk. There are empty coffee cups, the summons 
               and complaint, and the newspaper Gittes had brought with him 
               from the barber shop.

               The three men are sitting, worn and silent. Walsh chewing 
               gum is the loudest noise in the room.

               Gittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation. Walsh stops 
               chewing.

               Duffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the coffee 
               cups.

               Gittes is staring down at the newspaper. He suddenly grabs 
               the phone, begins dialing. A tight little smile breaks out 
               on his face.

                              watch)
                         And I'm late.

                         in and wait?

               Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half 
               rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door.

<b>               MULWRAY'S INNER OFFICE
</b>
               The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray 
               at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas 
               and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted 
               photo of Evelyn in riding clothes.

               Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in 
               the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he 
               does.

               He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly 
               examining the top. He tries one of the drawers and it doesn't 
               open.

               He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens.

               He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it, riffles 
               through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. Drops it, 
               finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a 
               Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Then,

               He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray's neat 
               hand:

                      "Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used."

               Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent 
               pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the 
               drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's glasses 
               off the desk top when he does. He catches them, puts them on 
               the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.

               Enters the room. An anxious Secretary is right behind him.

               This is more a request than an invitation. Gittes nods, 
               follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices 
               down the hall.

               Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his 
               handkerchief pocket. He goes out the door, nearly running 
               into a man who is standing by the Secretary's desk, about

               A powerful CHINESE BUTLER with heavy hair and a half-jacket 
               of gold on one front tooth, answers the door.

               He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet. The Butler 
               takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the 
               doorway.

               Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese GARDENER trim 
               a hedge. There's a SQUEAKING SOUND. Gittes moves a few feet 
               off the porch.

<b>               POV â€“ GARAGE

               A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a 
               chamois.

               Steam rises off the hood. The squeaking has obviously come 
               from the chamois.

               Gittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing for 
               him to follow.

<b>               THROUGH THE HOUSE â€“ GITTES

               Follows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. A 
               maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some 
               French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with 
               running water.

               Gittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very quiet 
               except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing. 
               After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles 
               at Gittes, probes into the pond.

               There's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes 
               it.

               After a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters 
               recede.

                         Yeah sure. Bad for glass.

               The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the 
               object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.

               He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks 
               it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the 
               gleaming object.

               He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the 
               trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto 
               it for poise.

               Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside 
               of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair.

               She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks 
               younger than she did in the office.

               Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is annoyed 
               as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.

               He laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply. There 
               is none.

               The Chinese Butler appears on the veranda.

               Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel 
               up into the parched hills.

               One a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir.

               The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open and there 
               are people milling around. The reservoir is below.

               Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE.

               Gittes hesitates only a moment, then:

                         Chief in the Department.

               He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief 
               pocket, hands it to the Guard.

</b>                         Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.

               Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the 
               reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well.

               Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their 
               backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the 
               reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently 
               dredging for something.

               One of the men turns and sees Gittes. He recognizes Gittes 
               and is visibly shocked.

               At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge 
               of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns 
               around. He's a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties,

               Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at 
               seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy.

               Loach is actually sweating. Finally, Escobar smiles.

               Escobar points down to the reservoir. A couple of men using 
               poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. It can be 
               SEEN that one of them has hooked something.

               He shouts. The other man hooks it, too. They pull, revealing 
               the soaking back of a man's coat. They start to pull the 
               body into the skiff.

               Are standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet 
               drawn back. Evelyn nods.

               Escobar drops the sheet. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet 
               to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying 
               to keep the corpse from hearing them.

               Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner's assistant 
               wheels the body out of the office.

               Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and 
               listening. At this question, he rises and looks through the

               Escobar sees him, ignores him. Evelyn doesn't see him.

               Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a

               Evelyn glances at Gittes. They go through a couple of outer 
               doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer 
               hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in 
               L.A." and "Southern Cafeteria."

               Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking 
               questions. Gittes brushes them aside.

               Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with 
               Mulwray's name. MORTY is standing near it in a doorway to an 
               adjoining room. A RADIO is on, and with it the announcement 
               that they're about to hear another chapter in the life of 
               Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle. Another Coroner's 
               assistant sits at the table, listening to the radio and eating 
               a sandwich.

               Gittes ambles into the room.

                         died lately.

               Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. CAMERA GETS ITS 
               FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray's body. Eyes open, the face badly 
               cut and bruised.

               Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an

               As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks 
               into a wrenching spasm of coughing. Gittes spots the other 
               body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray.

                         hang around Ferguson's Alley.

                         living in one of the downtown storm 
                         drains. Had a bureau dresser down 
                         there and everything.

               He's parked on an overpass. The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on 
               one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into the 
               riverbed below.

<b>               FROM THE BRIDGE
</b>
               Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its 
               contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below him, lying 
               half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank 
               of the river is a sign that proclaims "OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE 
               IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of 
               sorts. Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford 
               seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc. The trashy remains of 
               Shuhardt's home.

               Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near 
               the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. Gittes 
               pulls it out, swearing.

               He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears 
               the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.

               Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican 
               Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy 
               bank.

               channel.

<b>               FURTHER UP â€“ MOVING
</b>
               The road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is 
               overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.

<b>               STILL FURTHER â€“ NIGHT
</b>
               The road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus 
               are everywhere. It is very still. Another turn and a pie-
               shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be 
<b>               GLIMPSED.
</b>
<b>               POV â€“ CHAIN-LINK FENCE
</b>
               Over the road, bolted. It says "OAK PASS RESERVOIR. KEEP 
<b>               OUT. NO TRESPASSING."
</b>
               The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel 
               and down into it, making access along the channel itself 
               impossible.

               Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the 
               spotlight.

               A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole 
               illumination.

               There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.

               Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood 
               channel itself.

<b>               ON THE OTHER SIDE
</b>
               Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage 
               toward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the 
               reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.

               Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into 
               the flood control channel, which is at this point about four 
               feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men 
               scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. 
               Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.

               He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is 
               another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles 
               Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.

<b>               GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL â€“ NIGHT
</b>
               Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over 
               him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging 
               into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the 
               overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of 
               the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's 
               brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold. 
               He's nearly strained through it.

               Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing 
               water by means of the fence itself.

               Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and 
               makes his way toward his car.

<b>               AT GITTES' CAR
</b>
               He fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing.

<b>                                     GITTES

                         Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.

               He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a SMALLER 
               MAN stop him. Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning 
               his arms, holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a 
               switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left 
               nostril.

               Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead 
               gleaming on the silvery blade.

                         fellows?

               The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage 
               when he says this. Gittes doesn't move.

                         Wanna guess? No? Okay, lose their 
                         noses.

               With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade, 
               laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes 
               screams.

               Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.

               Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood 
               from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the Smaller Man 
               stare at him.

                              (meaning check)
                         This can look like you paid me off

               This subdues Gittes a little. Evelyn is still a little heated.

               Evelyn looks squarely at him. She doesn't deny it.

               Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.

                         intimate.

               Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle 
               his hand in front of their faces. She stares at him.

               MRS. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a 
               glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other, 
               and a menacing look in her eye.

                         happy now?

               She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse. Gittes 
               covers himself. Waiters rush over.

               Mrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again. She catches him 
               on the nose. It hurts. He covers it, then swings his leg out 
               from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin.

               Mrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink. She grabs 
               her shin, hopping around a little. The waiters who had tried 
               to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over.

               The attendant starts after it again. Gittes leans on the 
               open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but 
               spits it out.

                         interested your husband was murdered. 
                         Somebody's dumping tons of water out 
                         of the city reservoirs when we're 
                         supposedly in the middle of a drought, 
                         he found out, and he was killed. 
                         There's a waterlogged drunk in the 
                         morgue. Involuntary manslaughter if 
                         anybody wants to take the trouble 
                         which they don't. It looks like half 
                         the city is trying to cover it all 
                         up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs. 
                         Mulwray.

                         I goddam near lost my nose! And I 
                         like it. I like breathing through

               Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. She stares at 
               Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the car door 
               closed.

               She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him.

               The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner 
               office.

               Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment. He sees 
               a photographic display of "THE HISTORY OF THE DWP. THE EARLY 
               YEARS", along the wall. He stops as he spots a photo of the 
               man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier. He is 
               standing high in the mountains, near a pass. The caption 
               reads "JULIAN CROSS. 1905".

               Cross is strikingly handsome.

               Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn's 
               check. He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down 
               under the middle initial C, then he looks back to the photos.

               Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one. 
               She refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You 
               Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more 
               photographs.

               Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along 
               with Julian Cross. One of the captions: "HOLLIS MULWRAY AND

               She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office.

               Gittes goes back to the photographs. He hears a SCRATCHING 
               SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door.

               He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door. 
               Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the 
               outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise.

               The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.

               Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight

                         father felt that way.  Actually, it 
                         was over the Van der Lip. The dam

               Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn's reply. 
               Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of Evelyn.

               The engines make the small cabin vibrate. Gittes threads his 
               way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin, which 
               is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and their fishing 
               gear. Gittes is poked by a pole, has to move along.

               One of the old men says something to him.

               Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the PILOT looks up â€“ 
               nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half eaten cheese 
               sandwich out of Gittes' seat.

               Gittes.

               The Pilot glances over at Gittes who, as usual, is impeccably 
               dressed. A contrast to the others on the plane.

               A pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building 
               on the bay overlooking the harbor. The seaplane lands. A 
               motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns 
               and heads in the direction of the plane.

<b>               EXT. WINDING ROAD â€“ RANCHO DEL CRUCE
</b>
               Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign 
               with a cross painted below the name.

               The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island. 
               As the wagon continues one can SEE that it is actually a 
               miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and 
               canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of 
               the sea.

               The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered 
               around a corral. The circle of men drift apart, leaving JULIAN 
               CROSS standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome 
               in a rough linen shirt and jeans. When he talks his strong 
               face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged.

<b>               EXT. BRIDLE PATH â€“ GITTES & CROSS

               Walking toward the main house. A classic Monterey. A horse 
               led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates

               notice.

               Cross pauses when they reach the dung pile. He removes his 
               hat and waves it, inhales deeply.

               Cross' attention is diverted by the animals from time to

                         You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle

               Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes 
               approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk.

<b>                                     GITTES
</b>                         I'm a little lost. Where can I find 
                         the plat books for the northwest 
                         valley?

               The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little.

</b>                         Part of it's in Ventura County. We 
                         don't have Ventura County in our 
                         Hall of Records.

               Which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles.

</b>                         I'll settle for L.A. County.

                         Row twenty-three, section C.

               The Clerk turns away abruptly. Gittes regards his back a 
               moment, then goes to the stacks.

<b>               THROUGH THE STACKS
</b>
               Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something. The 
               second clerk gets on the phone. Gittes watches a moment, 
               then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks.

               He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it. It's 
               huge and there's a lot to go through.

               The print itself makes him squint.

</b>
               Showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS 
               designation where the description of the land parcel is long 
               and hopelessly involved e.g. '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 
               7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old 
               and faded. In the owners' column, however there are numerous 
               freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners.

</b>                         Hauls the huge volume back to the 
                         Clerk's desk.

                         Say... uh... sonny.

               The Clerk turns sharply around.

               Gittes looks a little surprised.

                         across.

               The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler 
               on the desk.

               Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the 
               book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically.

<b>               INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY
</b>
               Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward 
               the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a 
               strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and 
               property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or 
               coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.

<b>               EXT. ROAD â€“ GITTES DRIVING â€“ DAY
</b>
               Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying 
               groves, narrower roads.

               He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. There 
               is a "SOLD" sign on the collapsing barn. Gittes stops, checks 
               it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records.

<b>               OLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON
</b>
               And a few withered pepper trees. Gittes has paused at this 
               dried-up intersection. There is a "SOLD" sign on a drug store. 
               Gittes looks OFF SCREEN.

               Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud 
               of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.

               Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty yards 
               away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid 
               off it.

               Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth.

               Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.

               Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying 
               himself with the intricacies of his machine. He's aware of 
               Gittes watching him.

                         for.

               The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual is 
               immaculately dressed.

                         course, we're worried about the

<b>               GITTES DRIVING
</b>
               Is now covered with a film of dust:

               He reaches a fork in the dirt road. There are a couple of 
               mailboxes.

               Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.

               As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be 
               SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado 
               and walnut groves, their foliage heavy. The few structures 
               in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down 
               to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home. 
               Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.

               Gittes drives through a gate that has "NO TRESPASSING" and 
               "KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY" signs neatly printed on it.

               He drives down the road into the grove.

<b>               GITTES
</b>
               Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes. He 
               puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. By contrast 
               with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their 
               heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze.

               Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches of 
               the tree he'd been staring at.

<b>               EXT. AVOCADO GROVES â€“ DAY
</b>
               Gittes is shocked. He looks behind him. Riding on horseback 
               down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red-
               Faced Man in overalls. His hat blows off his head. He does 
               not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. Gittes' 
               lane of retreat is denied him. He guns the car, and takes 
               off down one of the orchard lanes.

<b>               MOVING WITH GITTES
</b>
               The dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of it, a 
               Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.

               Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the 
               trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here he's pursued 
               by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. Gittes yells at 
               it.

<b>               ANGLE ON GROVE
</b>
               Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes 
               toward a dust trail rising above the trees. They've spotted 
               it. Clearly it's from Gittes' car.

               This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one 
               on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and 
               across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator 
               are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.

               Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese 
               and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of 
               the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.

               Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches 
               over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of 
               the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle 
               with. The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back 
               with his crutch. The two of them manage to pound Gittes to 
               the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues 
               to whack away at Gittes with the crutch.

               The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a 
               mule ride up.

                         the man, see if he's armed.

               Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger 
               Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. Gittes 
               is badly banged up and half out on his feet. They toss his 
               wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.

               Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily.

               Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer. He has trouble 
               catching his breath. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in 
               the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply.

               Gittes reaches into his pocket. The paper's on the ground. 
               He picks it up.

               The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him 
               squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled 
               up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful 
               aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head. 
               Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the 
               Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt.

               the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog.

               The Red Faced Farmer's wife has set tea out. The farmers, 
               all of them, now seem awkward and a little embarrassed.

               He focuses on Evelyn who sits right next to him. He's got 
               dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge

               Gittes nods. He checks his watch. He looks out. It's almost 
               evening.

               Gittes says nothing. The wife of the Red Faced Farmer (DUBOIS) 
               looks reproachfully at Dubois. Gittes feels the back of his 
               head, It obviously hurts him.

</b>
               Looking. Either by accident or design, the primarily 
               octogenarian guests have segregated themselves. In one wing, 
               the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one 
               elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange.

               In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work on a 
               quilt.

               Gittes grabs Evelyn's hand.

                         They're all here. Every goddam name.

               Gittes points to the wall. It says "ACTIVITIES BOARD". There 
               are titles. "LAWN BOWLING". "BRIDGE". "FISHING". "CROQUET". 
               Below them are the names of the guests, entered under certain 
               activities, for certain days.

               After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes.

               Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the 
               quilt.

               Two of the ladies giggle. The third continues to busy herself 
               with her quilt, off by herself.

               Two of them say "she is," and point in different directions. 
               The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her

                         beach property in Long Beach, but we 
                         lost it.

               Gittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among 
               the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it.

               He looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish, 
               comes across the tail and by it the initials A.C.

               Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking 
               taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures 
               as if there's someone behind Palmer.

               Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake 
               of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back 
               to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's 
               jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket 
               covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating 
               him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly 
               pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red 
               and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.

               Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill's 
               gun has clattered to the floor.

                         What are you waiting for? Get in the 
                         car!

               Evelyn goes.

               Mulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for the 
               gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of his hand 
               and kicks it.

               It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the 
               wall.

               Palmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back 
               to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses.

               Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience 
               of ancients behind him.

               As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops. Two men are coming 
               toward him. One of them is shorter, and has the nervous, 
               jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.

               Gittes stops. The two men fan out and continue to move toward 
               him.

               Gittes spots the two-tone shoes. He begins to back up.

               Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly 
               behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn's car is headed across 
               the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it 
               gets near them. They look in disbelief, then dive for safety. 
               The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass.

               Evelyn opens the passenger door.

               She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door. Gittes 
               stares at it a moment. Then leaps out of bed, rummages around, 
               tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on. 
               Then hurries out of the bedroom.

</b>
               Running across the driveway to the garage. There are two 
               cars there.

               Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard.

               Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door.

<b>               INT. BUICK - GITTES
</b>
               Checks the ignition. No key is in it. He pulls a couple of 
               wires from under the dash, starts to mess with them, seems 
               satisfied.

               Slides out across the seat, slams the door.

<b>               EXT. MULWRAY DRIVEWAY â€“ NIGHT
</b>
               Gittes hurries over to the Packard. He gets down on the 
               driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself. With the heel 
               of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the 
               car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully pulls 
               the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light 
               beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and 
               hurries back toward the house.

               Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, 
               the red and white lights coming IN AND OUT OF VIEW.

<b>               GITTES DRIVING â€“ NIGHT
</b>
               Behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance 
               from Evelyn in front of him.

<b>               EVELYN'S PACKARD
</b>
               Pulls up before a small little bungalow house. She gets out, 
               looks up and down the street. There is nothing. She hurries 
               on up the walkway to the front door.

<b>               DOWN THE STREET â€“ GITTES IN BUICK
</b>
               Idles the engine with the lights off. He brings the car a 
               few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's.

               Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The 
               curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on 
               the side of the house.

               He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.

<b>               THROUGH THE WINDOW
</b>
               Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living 
               room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges back 
               through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and 
               pitcher on it.

<b>               GITTES
</b>
               Around to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery and 
               a short picket fence.

               He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series 
               of windows at the corner of the house. These all have shades 
               on them.

               He can hear someone crying in the house. Someone else talking 
               alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish. Here the 
               windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not 
               completely drawn.

               There's an inch or so of space at the bottom.

<b>               THROUGH THE WINDOW
</b>
               Gittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back and 
               forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone 
               rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure 
               is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes 
               INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen 
               with Hollis Mulwray.

               Mulwray's girlfriend. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking 
               in Spanish. Her words are not discernible but the tone is 
               bitter, anguished. A newspaper is strewn about the room.

               Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down some 
               pills.

               The girl reluctantly does.

               Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at 
               her.

</b>                         Then let's go talk to her.

               Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm, 
               nearly screaming:

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         No!

               Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn 
               jacket.

               He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming 
               effect on both of them.

                         She's too upset.

                         from her, I didn't want her upset 
                         before I could make plans for her to 
                         leave.

               Gittes explodes.

</b>                         Just tell me the truth. I'm not the

                         done. I'm not going to hurt you, but 
                         one way or another I'm going to know.

</b>                         I will if you don't.

               A long pause. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, 
               her hair covering her face.

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         She's my sister.

               Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. Not crying, but the 
               kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria. Gittes 
               puts an arm on her shoulder.

                         secrecy?

               She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely 
               puzzled.

                         Jesus Christ, say something. Was 
                         that it?

               She nods. Gittes sighs.

                         I would never ever have harmed Hollis. 
                         I loved him more than my own family. 
                         He was the most gentle, decent man

               There is a long moment of silence. Gittes looks over to 
               Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him.

               The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes 
               is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as

                         She begged me to call. She's waiting 
                         for you.

               Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead.

<b>               EXT. CERRITOS TOWER ROAD â€“ HOLLYWOOD HILLS â€“ EARLY MORNING
</b>
               Gittes pulls up. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow 
               walkway and sickly green stucco.

<b>               EXT. IDA SESSIONS' APARTMENT â€“ DAY
</b>
               Gittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. 
               Nothing. He opens it and enters.

<b>               INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
               Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust 
               particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes 
               sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone 
               table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets 
               closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside 
               the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. 
               Gittes walks on into the kitchen.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN
</b>
               Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying 
               on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a 
               broken bag.

               Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream 
               of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. 
               She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.

               Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes 
               for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen 
               counter.

               Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her 
               name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, 
               carefully replaces the items in the purse.

               He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, 
               which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves 
               across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.

               Gittes enters and turns on the light.

               Escobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the bathroom 
               by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A 
               THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall from the bedroom.

               Gittes looks at the two, doesn't reply.

               He indicates one of his assistants.

                         What happened to your nose, Gittes? 
                         Somebody slam a bedroom window on

               The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for

               In the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the girl in

               Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes.

               Gittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. He looks 
               in the garage. Evelyn's car is gone. Only the Gardener's 
               truck is there.

               Gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. He 
               rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries 
               it. It's locked.

               He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, 
               takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the 
               lock.

               The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at 
               Gittes.

               Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room 
               where luggage is packed and neatly piled.

               The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over 
               the furniture.

               The Gardener nods vigorously. Points to the pond.

</b>                         Velly velly bad.

               Gittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the 
               edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd 
               looked closely, a starfish.

               It has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just 
               beginning to grow back.

</b>
               Touches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then spots 
               something glinting in the bottom of the pond.

<b>                                     GITTES
</b>                         What's that... down there?

               The Gardener peers into the pond.

</b>                              (continuing)
                         ...there.

               The Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the 
               pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching 
               the water.

               He misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an 
               animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and 
               holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking 
               through the frame where one lens is shattered.

               The Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses. 
               They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.

               Gittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone table, 
               lying on his handkerchief are the glasses.

               The Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily 
               watching him.

               Gittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick. He hurries to the front 
               door, pounds on it.

               The Chinese servant answers the door.

               Gittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and when 
               Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in the face. 
               Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from 
               her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself.

               which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing.

               Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his

               With her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn 
               hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she re-emerges.

               Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the 
               stairs. He looks back down at Escobar. Gittes rings the bell. 
               He waits. It opens. It's a WOMAN who's not recognizable. 
               She's got the remnants of a black eye.

               He's seated at the dinner table with his father, his mother, 
               and his children. Curly looks up in surprise.

                         found out, Evelyn was lost to me a 
                         long time ago.

</b>                         I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. 
                         Gittes, most people never have to 
                         face the fact that at the right time 
                         and right place, they're capable of

                         him, will you, Claude?

               Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the glasses. 
               Gittes doesn't move.

                         really not worth it.

               Gittes hands over the glasses.

                         allows me to see her, or I'm not 
                         averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If 
                         I have to buy the jail. Hollis and 
                         Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen

               The streets are crowded. Here and there one can see Chinese 
               in traditional dress.

</b>
               Driving slowly, spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage, nearly 
               lost in the crowd. They are walking toward a car parked near 
               a laundry truck.

               Gittes sees them, keeps driving.

                         Stop the car. Stop the car!

               Mulvihill tries to clobber Gittes. Gittes elbows him. The 
               car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost.

<b>               EXT. STREET â€“ CROSS

</b>                         Katherine! Katherine! Wait!

               Gittes is after him, grabbing him. Cross tries to swing at 
               Gittes with his cane. Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and 
               the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd 
               scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit 
               Gittes on the side of the head. The three men crash to the 
               pavement.

<b>               CURLY

               Starts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him.

                         'em out of here!

               He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the 
               sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes try for it 
               but someone else has it.

<b>               EVELYN
</b>
               Holds the gun. She's shaking but apparently in control of 
               herself.

               Rises to his feet. Mulvihill starts to help Cross up.

</b>                         No, don't help him. Don't do anything.

               Mulvihill doesn't move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn holds 
               the revolver on him.

                         Sure, but I'd like to handle it.

               Evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her.

                         she is.

               Evelyn is backing up. Cross moving on her. Evelyn cocks the 
               pistol.

               There's the SOUND of a SIREN. Cross lunges toward her. Gittes 
               grabs Cross.

               Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd. Gittes sees 
               them.

                         Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in 
                         Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. 
                         It's the Evening Star. He'll be 
                         waiting. I'll take care of this.

               She looks to Gittes. He looks at her. She turns and he looks 
               at her.

               She turns and Escobar is standing between her and it.

               Evelyn gets in the car. She starts it. Gittes lets Escobar 
               go.

                         not going anywhere.

               There's a single GUNSHOT. Both men look surprised. Down the 
               block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside his 
               double-parked car.

               Duffy's sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street. 
               It jerks a couple of times, still in gear, then comes to a 
               halt.

               Gittes rushes to the car. He opens it. Evelyn falls out, 
               inert.

               Blood is pouring from her right eye.

               literally dragging him away from the scene, with Gittes trying 
               to shake free.
