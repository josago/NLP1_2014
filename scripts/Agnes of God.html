SISTER MARGUERITE is locking up for the night, shutting doors,
turning off lights, finally walks off down the corridor. Suddenly a
terrified scream is heard, the voice of a young woman.

<b>EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT
</b>
Lights in the windows flick on.

<b>INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
The nuns    are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps,
calling    urgently in French. They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room
and try    the door. It is blocked. Pushing harder they see the blood
stained    figure of SISTER AGNES. Much alarm and crying...

<b>EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT

An ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring. It cuts the
siren and stops outside the convent gates. The nuns open the gate and
the ambulance drives inside.

</b><b>INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
Two PARAMEDICS urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the
unconscious figure of Sister Agnes. The Mother Superior desperately
wipes and kisses her face.

                         She'll be fine.

They lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall.

The Mother Superior looks around worriedly and goes into...

<b>INT - SISTER AGNES' ROOM - NIGHT

She kneels down by a waste paper basket full of bloodied sheets and
starts to pull them out. Then she freezes, makes the sign of the
cross and starts to weep.

<b>EXT - SUPREME COURT - DAY
</b>
A normal busy day. A car pulls up with a woman and a man driving. The
woman is MARTHA LIVINGSTON. She kisses the man (LARRY), gets out of
the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of
the courthouse. There a group of REPORTERS there and a sudden bustle
of interest.

</b>                         Here they are now.

Martha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister
Marguerite, and Sister Agnes (dressed in a white novices habit) and
their LAWYER come out of the court escorted by police. The reporters
leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and
French. Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is
quickly bustled past. Martha goes on into the courthouse.

Inside EVE, LYON, and JUSTICE LEVEAU are sitting. Martha is standing
by the window smoking furiously.

       Martha pauses for a long moment at the window, then turns.

The Judge, Eve and Lyon all chuckle. The Judge throws the file down
on his desk towards her.

<b>16   EXT - CONVENT - DAY

        Martha pulls up in her BMW outside the convent walls and gets
out, cigarette
        in hand. A sign tangled over with creeper reads "Les Petites
Soeurs de Marie Madeleine". Martha jangles a bell. After a wait she
presses a buzzer. A   peephole in the door slams open and Sister
Marguerite looks out.

<b>                                      MARTHA

                       Livingston, I...

        The peephole slams shut, but the door does open. Sister
Marguerite glares at her.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)
                       Hello... I'm Doctor Martha
                       Living...ston... I...

        Martha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the
trouble
and hastily     grinds it underfoot.

        Sister Marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt. Martha
awkwardly tries
        to kick it away.

                       ...the court-appointed psychiatrist.

        Sister Marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and
motions for her to    come in.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)
                       Thank you. I um... I believe your
                       Mother Superior's expecting me.

       Martha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent.


<b>17   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY

        Martha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room.
Sister moves    off, leaving Martha looking around curiously. Then
the MOTHER MIRIAM arrives from behind the grilled door, sees
Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight
start.

        A little later, Martha is sitting alone smoking. SISTER ANNE
enters and indicates that Martha should follow her. They exit out of
the grilled room
        and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs. Faintly the
voice
of a single
        young woman can be heard singing in Latin.

        Martha follows Sister Anne down the hall towards the singing.
They stop outside Agnes' room. Martha looks to see...

        ... Agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily,
looking out the
        window. Then Agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly.
She
turns to see
        Martha standing in the doorway.

        Martha moves further in the room. An ELDERLY NUN hovers
outside
the door.

         Agnes laughs and Martha closes the door, shutting out the old

<b>                                 AGNES

</b><b>
</b>And then what?

<b>                  AGNES
</b>I fell asleep.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>In the middle of all the pain?

<b>                  AGNES
</b>Yes.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>Where did the baby come from?

</b>What baby?

<b>               MARTHA
</b>The baby they made up.

<b>               AGNES
</b>From their heads...

<b>               MARTHA
</b>Is that where they say it came
from... ?

<b>               AGNES
</b>No, they say it came from the waste
paper basket!

<b>               MARTHA
</b>Where'd it come from before that?

<b>                  AGNES
</b>From God.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>After God... before the waste-paper
basket.

                       lights on their mothers chest and
                       whispers into her ear. That makes good
                       babies start to grow. And bad babies
                       come from when a fallen angel squeezes
                       in down there, and they start to grow,
                       grow, till they come out down there.
                       I don't know where good babies come out.
                       And you can't tell the difference...
                       except bad babies cry a lot... and they
                       make their fathers go away... and their
                       mothers get very ill... die sometimes.

       Agnes sits down on a bench and Martha follows her.

                                       AGNES (Cont.)
                       Mummy wasn't very happy when she died
                       ... and, I think she went to hell because
                       every time I see her she looks like she
                       just stepped out of a hot shower, and I...
                       I'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who
                       tells me things! They fight over me all
                       the time.
                               (staring into space)
                       The Lady... I saw when I was ten. I was
                       lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and
                       the sun became a cloud, and the cloud
                       became, a Lady. And she told me she would
                       talk to me. And then... her feet began to
                       bleed and I saw there... there were holes
                       in her hands and in her side. And I tried to
                       catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but
                       I couldn't see any more because my eyes
                       hurt because there were big black spots in
                       front of them. And she tells me things like,
                       like... right now she's crying Marie! Marie!
                       ... but I don't know what that means.

        Martha stands up, disturbed. Agnes is slightly delirious with
happiness.

                       if she's throwing a big hook through
                       the air and it catches me under my ribs
                       and tries to pull me up, and I... I can't
                       move because Mommy's holding my feet
                       and all I can do is sing in her voice...
                       it's the Lady's voice, God loves you!

        Mother Miriam glances up at an older NUN who has been in the

<b>                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>                       My dear, I don't think a communion wafer

                       Yes, of God.

        Then Mother Miriam looks down and is shocked to see Agnes'
white habit is spotted with blood, and more blood is dripping onto
the floor. She pulls out   Agnes' hand from her habit and gasps with
shock; there is a bleeding hole in
        the middle of her palm.

                       to me in tears, asking for comfort,
                       comfort because she was too old to
                       have any children. Not that she wanted
                       to, but once a month she had been
                       reminded of that possibility.

<b>49   INT - SICKROOM - NIGHT

        Still in flashback, Mother Miriam enters the room where
<b>SISTER

nuns singing hymns.

</b>                       The twenty third of January. On that
                       night one of our elder nuns passed away.

</b>                       Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was.
                       I was needed in the sick room.

        Father Martineau annoints the old woman. Then Agnes quietly
slips in   unobserved. Sister Paul rallies for a moment, tries to say
a single silent
        word to her. The smile slips from Agnes' face. Then Sister
Paul
lies back
<b>
</b>       and dies.

</b>                       Well you're probably right about

                       few heretics, sell some indulgences?
                       That was in the days when the Church
                       was a ruling body. We let governments
                       do those things today. So what did we

        A couple of nuns walk across the courtyard. Another is
meditating alone. On
        a bench a nun kisses a dove and lets it fly away.


<b>63   EXT - GAZEBO - DAY

        It is out the back of the convent near the belltower. Mother
Miriam and
Martha are sitting there talking. Martha is smoking.

</b>                          When I was a child I used to hear my
                          guardian angel. She sang to me 'till I
                          was six years old. That's when I stopped
                          listening. But I remember the voice. A
                          few years ago I looked at myself and saw
                          nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing.
                          Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And
                          then one evening I saw Agnes standing by

                          her window, singing. And all my doubts about
<b>
</b>                       myself and God were gone, in that one moment.
                       I recognized the voice. Please don't take it
                       away from me again Doctor Livingston. Those
                       years after six were very bleak.

        Various closeups of famous statues. A bell is tolling. Two
nuns
come out of
        a building, down streets, across the road as though traffic
did
not exist
        and into another building.


<b>71   INT - LIFT - DAY
</b>
       The nuns are Sister Anne and Mother Miriam. In the lift an
<b>
</b><b>OFFICE GIRL
</b>        checks her lipstick in the reflective metal walls. The lift
stops and the
        Sisters get off.


<b>72   INT - CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
       They walk down the modern carpeted corridor into...


<b>73   INT - MARTHA'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
       Mother Miriam addresses the secretary, HELEN.

<b>                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>                       Is the Doctor in her office?

<b>                                      HELEN
</b>                       Ah, who shall I say is calling?

<b>                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>                               (grimly)
                       General MacArthur.

       She heads onto Martha's office. Helen jumps up after her.

<b>                                      HELEN
</b>                       Just a minute please, you can't go in
                       there.

       Mother Miriam pushes the door open to reveal Martha.

<b>                                              MARTHA

                       It's... it's alright Helen, just close
                       the door.

        Mother Miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto
Martha's desk.

<b>                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>                       I've just met with the bishop. We're
                       taking you off the case.

<b>
</b><b>                MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>        (halting)
One that will approach this matter
with some objectivity and respect.

<b>                  MARTHA
</b>For the Church?

<b>                  MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>For Agnes.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>You think she's a saint?

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>She's been touched by God, yes.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>How? How? She hallucinates, stops
eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is
that supposed to convince me she
shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.

<b>                  MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>The father!

<b>                  MARTHA
</b>Who is he?

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>Why must he be anybody?

<b>                MARTHA
</b>        (laughs and sits down)
My God, you're as crazy as...

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth,
I'm saying...

<b>               MARTHA
</b>How (distorted) ?

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>Don't be ridiculous.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>Well give me a reasonable explanation

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>A miracle is an event without an
explanation. If she's capable of putting
a hole in her hand without benefit of a
nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her
womb?

<b>                  MARTHA
</b>This is insane.
<b>
</b><b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>There as no man in the convent on that
night and no way for any man to get in
or out.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>You're saying God did it?

<b>                  MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>
No, that's as much as saying Father
Martineau did it. I'm saying God
permitted it.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>But how did it happen?

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>You'll never find the answer for
everything God did.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>I thought you didn't believe in miracles
today Mother?

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>But I want the opportunity to believe.
I want the choice to believe.

<b>                  MARTHA
</b>But what    you are choosing to believe
is a lie    because you won't face the fact
that she    was raped... or seduced...
or that    she did the seducing.

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>She is an innocent.

<b>               MARTHA
</b>But she is not an enigma Mother.
Everything that Agnes has done is
explainable from modern psychiatry.
One, two, three, right down the line.

<b>               MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>That's what you believe she is?     The
sum of her psychological parts?

<b>               MARTHA
</b>That's what I have to believe...

<b>                MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>Then why are you so obsessed with her?
You're losing sleep over her?
        (Martha gets up disturbed)
You're thinking about her all the time.
You're bent on saving her. Why?
<b>
</b>       Martha has no answer.

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
                                (calmer)
                        I'm not accusing. I'm recognizing.

</b>                        There's a tunnel out of the crypt into
                        the barn. Did you know about that?
                        There's an answer Mother. That's how
                        she got out.

</b>                        That's crazy. How could she find out
                        about it?

<b>                                       MARTHA
</b>                        Somebody told her.

<b>                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>                        Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't
                        been used in fifty years.

<b>                                       MARTHA
</b>                        Oh, would you stop lying Mother!

<b>                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>                        Why would I lie?

<b>                                       MARTHA
</b>                        Because it's murder we're talking about.
                        Aren't you concerned about what she told
                        us about the other person in her room.

<b>                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>                        I'm concerned about her health.

<b>                                       MARTHA
</b>                        Who was that person Mother?    Was it
                        you?

<b>                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
</b>                        If you believe this is murder, it is the
                        Crown attorney you have to talk to, not
                        me. And definitely not Agnes.

       She goes out and slams the door.


<b>74   EXT - POND - DAY
</b>
        After a couple of establishing shots of the convent, the nuns
are shown ice   skating on the frozen pond. They are quite
uninhibited, like little
        children. Their singing (off) from the chapel continues until
the end of
        scene 78.

</b><b>75   INT - CHAPEL - DAY

        Sister Genevieve, the other novice is being consecrated. She
approaches the altar all dressed in white, carrying a single candle
and kneels down.

<b>77   INT - CHAPEL - DAY
</b>
        The scene consists of a number of shots dissolving into one
another. Sister Genevieve lying face down in front of the bishop,
Genevieve praying on her   knees, her family (4) watching from
behind the grilled gate. Genevieve's
        hair being cut, her joy at the habit being fitted to her,
running out to
        join her family, a jolly old singalong on the piano, this
time
the nuns
        singing along from    behind the gate.

        Martha drives up in her car and walks across the now snow
covered grounds to    the convent.


<b>79   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
        Mother Miriam is working away at her desk when a nun
interrupts. Singing   from the party can faintly be heard.

                                                 NUN (off)
                          Excuse me Mother, Doctor Livingston
                          is here.

        Mother Miriam nods tiredly and goes to meet Martha at he
door.
Martha hands    her a court order. Mother Miriam reads it briefly
and hands it back.

        It is the same as before, except that this time Martha and
Mother Miriam are      standing.

</b>        There is a flash cut to Sister Paul being annointed. Agnes
stirs slightly.

        There is another flash cut, this time of Sister Paul saying
that mysterious word that we could not previously understand.

        There is a third flash cut of the shrine of Saint Michael in

on her back.

horrified
to see two

</b>                        In view of the situation as it now
                        stands, and the testimony given here
                        this morning, it seems quite clear

                        responsible for her actions. It is
                        therefore the judgement of this court
                        that she be returned to the convent of
                        Marie Madeleine where she will be cared
                        for under proper medical supervision by
                        a visiting physician.

        Both Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this. Justice
Leveau continues
        to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up.

                        I stood in the window of my room
                        every night for a week. And one night
                        I heard the most beautiful voice
                        imaginable. And when I looked I saw
                        the moon shining down on him. For six
                        nights he sang to me, songs I'd never
                        heard. And on the seventh night he
                        opened his wings and lay on top of me.
                        All the while he sang -
                                (sings)

         Martha and Mother Miriam step forward uncertainly.

         The nuns lead Agnes, still singing past Martha and out of the
court.

</b>        It is full winter; many shots of the convent and surroundings
dissolving
        into one another.

</b>                       I don't know the meaning behind the
                       song she sang. Perhaps it was a song
                       of seduction. And the father was a
                       fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply
                       a lullaby that she remembered from many
                       years ago. And the father was hope and...
                       and love and desire. And a belief in
                        miracles.

        The nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to
the
convent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard.

                       And I do miss her, and I hope that she's
                       left something, some little part of
                       herself with me. That would be miracle

singing and the music fades in on the same key. Agnes gently takes
on of the doves and lets
        it fly away across the snowy landscape.
