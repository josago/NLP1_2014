          Well, Jonesy here, he's a music freak,
          right? And he figures this sonar system
          is basically just a big old 300 million

<b>                         (SLIDE)

          of the typhoon class, she's some six
          hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two
          thousand tons submerged displacement,
          roughly the size of a World War II

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped
          to fire long-range missiles from Russian
          waters, Red October carries fifty-six
          SS-311s, which is a short-range attack
          mis it with eight independent warheads.
          That's four hundred forty-eight warheads
          all spedfically designed to fire close in.

<b>                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)

          here again on the stern, enclose a
          magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar,

          it through the tape machine several times

          asked the computer to identify it, the

          was gone and I couldn't find it. But

</b>          Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was
          bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine-

</b>          I came back to it at about ten-hundred
          and the bearing was two-four-two. The
          last signal was real faint and I didn't
          have a very good lock on it.

          away from us, right? Let's say it was
          halfway between us and Iceland. That
          would put it on a course like this.

          heard is the acoustical signature of some
          kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and
          he's taking the inshore track off the

          Taking a deep breath, Ramius studies the surrounding hills. Lights
          from farms twinkle in the night air.

</b>          Welcome to the new world, sir.

<b>                         DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>                         A STEWARDESS
</b>          walking down the aisle of an airplane, checking passengers.
          Stopping near the front of the cabin, she glances down at

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          sound asleep in his seat, empty tea cup on a tray beside him. A
          blanket hangs on one log. In the seat next to him

<b>          A TEDDY BEAR
</b>          smi> out at passing clouds. The bear's got a red ribbon round his
          neck-and a seat belt fastened over his bulging tummy.

          Covering Ryan with the blanket, the stewardess leaves. Tea cup
          RATTLES. Ryan doesn't even twitch. Turbulence is a thing of the
          past.

<b>                         FADE OUT

<b>                         THE END
