<b>          
</b>          There's gentle motion in the blank frame, like swirling 16mm
          grain. A RUMBLE starts to build, low but growing louder...
<b>          
</b>          The grain moves faster, big chunks fluttering, now a dirty
          dishwater grey. The RUMBLE becoming a HOWLING WIND.

          MAX PAYNE thrashes in the water, a long way from shore.

                      river. Criminals, people who ran out of

<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Chunks of ice float in the dirty water around him. Max's

</b>          Nothing to orient us to the location, the time. Just a flash
          of golden light filling the hall, warm as the river was cold.
          Around a closed door, sunlight streams through the gaps...

</b><b>          
</b>          A WOMAN sleeps on the bed, curled up around a bundled BABY.
          Is this the final, peaceful memory of a drowning man?
<b>          
</b>          Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural
          position, more thrown than laid across the bed. The crib
          tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open.
<b>          
</b>          Something BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING
          into the glass. The sound of the BLIZZARD creeps in...

</b>          Wind POUNDS the river where Max had once been, but there's no
          more thrashing in the water. Mixed in behind the falling
          snowflakes, BLACK SHAPES swirl and dive closer to the water.

<b>          
</b>          Max breaks the surface - GASPING, STRUGGLING against the
          undertow. Not simply trying to breathe...trying to swim.

</b>          Abruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its
          place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight.
          Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN
          duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway...
<b>          
</b>          On the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them.

</b>          A filthy platform, empty except for the three Men huddled on
          a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear...
<b>          
</b>          The same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the
          walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold
          wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls
          back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three...
<b>          
</b>          The watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked
          `MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy.
<b>          
</b><b>          SUBWAY BATHROOM
</b><b>          
</b>          The Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious
          prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the
          edge of the sink before washing his hands...

<b>          
</b>          No answer. One of the Men LOCKS the door.       At the sound of
          the lock SNAPPING, he raises his head...
<b>          
</b>          Max Payne, but not yet the man struggling for life in the
          river: clean-shaven, skin like bleached bone. Haunted eyes.
          In the murky mirror, Max sees the Men circling closer...

<b>          
</b>          Max shuts off the water and calmly turns to face them.

<b>          
</b>          Doug frowns, deeply confused about being called by his name.

          it on Max's forehead. The third man - not much more than a
          KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.

                           (to Doug)
                       Go get my watch.
<b>          
</b>          Distractedly eyeballing Max, Doug brushes the watch off of
          the sink. It hits the dirty tile, delicate crystal CRACKING.
<b>          
</b>          In a sudden blur of movement, Max has one hand on the pistol,
          the other one SMASHING into Pawnshop's windpipe...
<b>          
</b>          Doug steps forward to help... BOOM! The pistol goes off as
          Max pries it free. Max looks up at Doug. Nowhere to run, he
          races into the farthest stall and SLAMS the door.
<b>          
</b>          In the same instant, the Kid bolts for the door. Max has to
          pick: follow or stay with the man he's tracking...
<b>          
</b>          In the stall, Doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky
          floor, trying to squeeze under the divider. Max raises the
          pistol and BLASTS a hole through the door of the next stall.

                       Watch over me, watch over me...
<b>          
</b>          The newly-perforated door flies open. Handcuffs SNAP,
          restraining a WHIMPERING Doug to the toilet pipe.

<b>          
</b>          Doug finds himself staring at the pistol's front sight. Max
          reaches into his pocket and produces a tattered photograph...
          It's the woman from Max's golden vision in the river.

          relaxing as escape seems certain.
<b>          
</b>          Down to a walk, he startles at movement in the tunnel ahead:
          FLAPPING WINGS - a bird, lost and trapped underground?
<b>          
</b>          The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to
          drown the sound out. It grows, though, more WINGS joining...
<b>          
</b>          He turns to retreat up the tracks, but the WINGS suddenly
          seem to be echoing towards him from all directions.
<b>          
</b>          Panicked, the Kid becomes disoriented in the growing RACKET,
          the tunnel ahead begins to glow brighter as he spins...
<b>          
</b>          Visible now in the growing light, BLACK SHAPES flicker above
          the tracks - dozens becoming hundreds, swelling larger, their

</b>          Max lays his jacket across the back of a worn leather chair,

</b>          Carefully, Max rests the full glass on the arm of the chair.

          swirls of oil pastels sketch out a still life in Technicolor.
<b>

          won't cooperate - as if the page ways more than Max can lift.

<b>          
</b>          Max follows her gaze to the front door, where Trevor is
          nervously greeting another new arrival: MONA SAX. She's
          striking, beautiful but also a little frightening. It
          doesn't hurt that she's flanked by BODYGUARDS. Russian Mob.
<b>          
</b>          Seeing Natasha standing with Max, Mona barrels across the
          room towards them. People stand aside to let her pass.
<b>          
</b>           ithout preamble, Mona begins YELLING at Natasha in Russian.
          Natasha RESPONDS in kind, clearly intimidated by Mona.
<b>          
</b>          Abruptly, Mona grabs Natasha's arm, jerking her off balance.

</b>          Mona returns to Natasha, dragging her towards the door.
          Natasha's tone becomes PLEADING, physically no match for
          Mona. Max steps in, reaching up to touch Mona's shoulder...
<b>          I
</b>           t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's
          arm. Incredibly, he's just as fast, slipping free of the
          grip that would surely have snapped his wrist...
<b>          
</b>          For a moment, Max and Mona stare each other down. Surprised,
          reevaluating each other. Natasha continues to TALK, her
          Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.
<b>          
</b>          Mona's eyes drop to Max's chest, where the tussle pulled his
          coat open to reveal a low-pro holster and tarnished badge.
<b>          
</b>          With the flick of her wrist, Mona stops her guards' advance.
<b>          
</b>          The crowd begins to notice the altercation. Natasha keeps
          TALKING, trying desperately to make peace and reassure Mona
          of something. Mona's eyes cut between Natasha and Max...
<b>          
</b>           till apprehensive, Mona shakes her head and walks away.

<b>          
</b>          As Max nods at the understatement, Trevor rushes over,
          forcing a broad smile to reassure his guests. He pulls Max's
          coat closed over the badge and ushers him towards the door.

</b>          A ring of candles in the center of the floor provides the
          only light. It's not enough to really see the PEOPLE inside.
          We hear them CHANTING, low voices MURMURING in unison...
<b>          
</b>          Quick glimpses in the candle light, bare flesh writhing.
          Cast on the walls, corresponding shadows twist and shift...
<b>          
</b>          A black feather billows across the floor between candles.
          Spreading up the wall, a new shadow rises above the rest...
<b>          
</b>              pair of wings - long and distorted in the candle light.
<b>

          twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow. JACK LUPINO.
<b>          
</b>           uddenly, Max turns and sees Natasha standing beside him.     We
          immediately notice something different about her: staring

                      you going to do for him, now?

                       somebody down to collect the...you know,

                       delivered to me. One box's got my guy's
                       hands and ears in it. The other box has

</b>          At the edge of a strip mall, a ramshackle personal storage
          business sits behind a razor-wire fence. Inside the fence,
          rows of stalls for rent, covered by metal garage doors.
<b>          
</b>           here's the faint sound of METAL STRETCHING, and Max is over
          the fence. He moves through the rows, reading the numbers.
<b>          
</b>          A padlock hangs from the door, shining metal glazed over with
          a sheet of ice. Max finds a pristine key on a ring in his

          light. Opening it, he roots around and finds a flashlight.
          Switched on, a golden beam cuts through the blue shadows.
<b>          
</b>          Max walks deeper into the space, brushing the light over the
          boxes. He holds his hand over one, as if warming it...
<b>          
</b>          Max opens the box.
<b>          
</b>           aiting for him under the flaps, a stuffed animal stares up
          at Max from inside the box. Silly grin, frozen eyes shining.
<b>          
</b>          Hands trembling, Max pushes the toy aside. Deeper in the
          box, he finds a framed picture and pulls it into the light...
<b>          
</b>          The photograph is of Max - younger, cleaner, genuinely
          smiling. Posed along with him, Olan Mills-style, are
          Elizabeth and the baby. Gauzy backdrop, church clothes.
<b>          
</b>          Max studies it, haggard new face reflecting in the glass...
<b>          
</b>          Abruptly, Max jumps up and moves away from the box. Long
          strides, trying in vain to physically shake the memories, to
          block out the emotions with something productive...
<b>          
</b>          The flashlight beam keeps sweeping, deeper and deeper. Max
          chokes back tears, occasionally glancing at the baby box.
<b>          
</b>           he beam hits on a document box in the back row.   `OFFICE.'
<b>          
</b>          Max rushes over, nearly tipping the other boxes in his hurry
          to throw the lid off the document box. Rows of folders, all

<b>

</b>          Only one file in the final section. Max opens it, finding

</b>          Max studies the cop - stiff legs unsteady on the deep snow,
          his frostbitten fingers wrapped around the trigger. Trapped
          between two rows of locked doors, Max has no cover to run.

</b>          Max starts to lay down, causally laying his hand over the
          power cord. The cop edges closer, smirking as Max complies.

          Before he can fire again, Max pounces on the cop, driving a

          and lets the gun fall in the snow beside the unconscious cop.

</b>          Struggling to his feet, Max races down the corridor and
          scaling the icy chain link. He drops into the snow,

                       addictive, the damage it did to the mind

</b>          The back room is deeper than the poor light gives away.
          Max's boots grind over burned-out candles, occult runes...
<b>          
</b>          Lupino launches out of the darkness at Max.   Before he sees
          it coming, Lupino drives a hard punch into Max's skull.
<b>          
</b>          Max stumbles forward, ears ringing from the blow. Lupino
          draws a gleaming knife from his boot and springs on Max.
<b>          
</b>           upino swings the knife so quickly it becomes a blur, blade
          WHISTLING as it cuts through the smoke. He slashes the knife
          across Max's thigh, dropping him to the ground.
<b>          
</b>           nable to stand, Max thrusts the rifle up for protection.
          The blade CLANKS against the barrel, carving deep trenches in
          the stock, finally gashing the back of Max's fingers.
<b>          
</b>          Blood rushes from the cuts, loosening Max's grip on the
          weapon. Teeth gnashing like an animal, Lupino reaches out
          and tries to pull the machine gun out of Max's hands.
<b>          
</b>           upino buries the knife into Max's shoulder.    He CRIES OUT.

<b>          
</b>          Lupino drives his knee into Max's chest. Arm numb from the
          stab wound, Max's grip on the gun is slowly overpowered.
          Helplessly watching it slip away, Max SCREAMS with rage...

</b>          Lupino leans over Max, one hand grinding the knife deeper

          Max desperately tries to dig his nails into the grip...

<b>          
</b>          Sweat streams down Lupino's face, dripping down onto Max.
          Fingernails splitting, Max finally loses hold of the gun.

<b>          
</b>          Lupino drops the machine gun. Max clamps his hand over
          Lupino's throat, using his grip to force the knife deeper.
          While Lupino GASPS, eyes wide, Max struggles to his feet.

<b>          
</b>          Max looks at Lupino - up close, his undyed skin is ashen and
          pockmarked, older than his age. Blood drools from his lips.
          Lupino's eyes swim around, lost in a fog of drugs and pain.

<b>          
</b>          Max spins towards the hall, but another SHOT rakes across his

          only lift his eyes to see who's coming to finish it...
<b>          
</b>           B steps out of the smoke.
<b>

</b>          The blizzard has won - streets and sidewalks no longer
          scraped, cars long abandoned under their icy cocoons. The

</b>          Suddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind. No
          chance to respond, bodies torn open with a merciless BLAST of
          machine gun fire. They fall around Max, joining the rest.

<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>                                 BB
</b>                       Just get to it, already. That's all I
                       ask. You've earned it, so just...
<b>          
</b>          With the pain in his stomach causing some difficulty, Max
          pulls the pistol's slide back to check for a live round.
<b>          
</b>          BB watches Max's preparations, terror growing. Unable to
          resist his panic, BB abruptly tries on a helpless smile.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 BB
</b>                       But I want you to listen to me, first.
                       Just try to hear what--
<b>          
</b>          Max raises the pistol and PULLS THE TRIGGER. The slug hits
          BB in the center of the forehead, snapping his neck back.
<b>          
</b>          The shell casing twirls down, landing in the snow without a
          sound. BB's corpse lands a moment later with a clumsy THUD.
<b>          
</b>          Max lets the gun slip out of his hand and walks past the body
          - BB's eyes frozen on the sky, red halo slowly expanding.
<b>          
</b>          Max reaches the edge, the river's black body revealed below.
          His gait falters, blood filling each footprint in the snow...
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - DAWN
</b><b>          
</b>          The SWAT team streams through the door, racing for the roof.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAWN
</b><b>          
</b>          Max stands at the roof's edge. A stiff wind buffets against
          his chest, forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little.
<b>          
</b>          Slowly, his eyes drift from the water below to the sky...
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                CUT TO:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. MAX'S BEDROOM (VISION) - TWILIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          From the doorway, Max watches Michelle smiling down at their
          baby, who grabs at her finger with a wide grin.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MAX'S VOICE
</b>                       I don't believe in heaven.
<b>          
</b>          Gently, Max takes a seat on the edge of the bed beside them.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  99.

</b><b>          EXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAWN
</b><b>          
</b>          Max looks up at the sky. Behind him, the SWAT team races
          outside, swarming and BARKING orders at Max, weapons raised.
<b>          
</b>          Max drops to his knees. He raises his hands, one dripping
          with his own blood. But his eyes stay on the sky...
<b>          
</b><b>                              MAX'S VOICE
</b>                    But I have this idea about it.
<b>          
</b>          ...where a tiny tear opens in the clouds, revealing steel
          grey dawn beyond.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                          FADE OUT.
</b><b>          
</b><b>                              THE END
