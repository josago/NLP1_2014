          1. Film opens with beautiful shot of the skyline of
          downtown Baltimore in the spring. Credits begin.
          Cut to "The Hippodrome Theater," one-time downtown movie
          palace, now abandoned and boarded up with broken and
          blank marquee. The credits to our movie continue by
          fading in on marquee.

          Cut to thriving "Harbor Court" theaters, downtown
          chain. All six marquees list the same two
          mega-budget Hollywood hits. Hollywood titles fade
          out and "Cecil B. DeMented" title logo fades into
          marquee in all its terrorist glory.

          Cut to old "Towson Theater." A "FOR RENT" sign is
          on marquee of this one-time neighborhood theater.
          "FOR RENT" sign fades out and our credits fade in
          on marquee.

          Cut to "Towson Commons," a modern cineplex down the
          street. All the titles listed on marquee are
          sequels. Sequel titles fade out and our credits
          fade in on marquee.

          Cut to "5 West Theater," one-time art house. The
          marquee now announces "Sunday Church Service" which
          fades out and our credits continue, fading in.
          Cut to "Westview Mall," suburban multiplex, all
          the titles listed on marquee are recent Hollywood
          comedy bombs. The Hollywood titles fade out and our
          credits fade in.

          Cut to "New Theater," once a popular downtown premiere
          spot. The marquee reads C-L-O-S-E-D in badly spaced
          letters. The letters fade out and our credits fade in.

          to Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles. Each
          displays the logo of a film title that was shot on
          location in Baltimore and premiered at this theater;

          the camera pans across this local tourist attraction.
          Cut to SINCLAIR STEVENS, the handsome but intense
          20-year-old theater manager as he adjusts the final
          letter of the film's title on the marquee, perched atop
          a ladder. SINCLAIR is dressed in an obviously rented
          tuxedo and for a moment seems like any other middle
          class suburban kid.

          sourpussed but unconventionally striking cashier;
          CHARDONNAY, the African-American ticket-taker with a
          huge 90's hairdo so popular with the black girls in
          Baltimore; RAVEN, the happy and always smiling pretty
          usherette, and FIDGET, the dweebish but somehow sexy
          janitor. All have made an attempt to dress up their

          outside hotel window and we see she is about forty

          HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening
          gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise
          Brooks style that has become her signature. She
          continues her press conference under the watchful eyes
          of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant
          LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere.
          ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve.

          MR. STILLINGS lectures his other staff members as
          CATERERS and BARTENDERS set up behind him. SINCLAIR
          STEVENS is paying close attention as is LYLE, the
          projectionist, a handsome but surprisingly gaunt young
          man. CHERISH, a sexy and slightly nasty candy-counter
          girl leers at SINCLAIR who flirts back as she feigns
          interest in MR. STILLINGS' pep talk. PAM the popcorn

          "Forced Entry," wearing her signature hairdo and a sexy
          nightgown as she writes in her diary on her bed.

          Dear Diary, My husband is
          trying to kill me but nobody
          will believe me.
          She hears a noise and sits up in bed as her pet cat

          FIDGET sees his PARENTS in distance and jumps off roof
          to follow and is safely caught by CECIL FANS.
          LEWIS looks into cheering FANS' faces and suddenly jumps
          from concession stand roof with changing bag into mob of
          FANS and removes exposed film from PAM's camera.
          SWAT TEAM MEMBER B jumps from high roof of manager's
          office to concession stand roof pointing an AR15 at

<b>          HONEY.

<b>                         SWAT B
</b>          I seen what you did, you
          Hollywood bitch!
          HONEY looks through the tear gas below to see GROUPIE
          suddenly battling himself free from JOCKS A, B & C. He
          bravely beckons HONEY to jump.
          CECIL disengages CHERISH's dead body up and off of him
          and seeing HONEY in danger crawls painfully to Pam's
          wheelchair dolly.

<b>                         (TO HONEY)
</b>          You're under arrest, Honey
          Whitlock!
          HONEY leaps from roof into mob of FANS and lands safely
          in GROUPIE's arms. They immediately begin to kiss in
          wild abandon.
          SWAT B shoots GROUPIE from atop roof and kills him.
          HONEY cries out at his death and panics as SWAT TEAM
          MEMBERS move in on her pointing high-powered rifles.
          FANS and ENEMIES scatter, abandoning her.

          SWAT B dead, struggles aboard dolly and nods to FIDGET
          to douse him with gas.

          HONEY looks for help but she is suddenly all alone.
          CECIL pushes himself forward on wheelchair dolly,
          gaining speed and begins laughing maniacally.
          FIDGET flicks lit match on CECIL as he rolls by and
          CECIL ignites like a Buddhist monk.

</b>          CECIL smashes into SWAT TEAM and they go up in flames,
          saving HONEY in the nick of time.

          HONEY sees BALTIMORE CITY POLICE, MARYLAND STATE
          TROOPERS, more SWAT TEAMS, local and national PRESS
          TEAMS, all running towards her with guns and camera
          equipment. She turns away, pulls out compact and sees
          her smeared makeup. She looks for RAVEN to touch her up
          and spots her being hustled away by SATANIST-TYPE FANS
          outside concession stand moments before the plate glass
          windows are shattered by police gunfire.

          PETIE is jumped and arrested by special SWAT TEAM
          wearing rubber gloves and surgical masks. PETIE laughs
          and moans in S & M pleasure as he tries to grope an
          especially macho MEMBER OF SWAT TEAM.

          HONEY turns back to mob in front of her and gives them a
          demented movie star grin.

          167. BENGIES DRIVE-IN MARQUEE. Out front of theater. 167.
          FIDGET struggles to climb up marquee to search for his
          PARENTS but he doesn't see them. He angrily starts
          throwing down letters as weapons at fleeing cars,
          smashing the window of bleeding, injured JOCKS A, B &
          C's car.

          With only a few letters left on the marquee, FIDGET
          re-arranges them to read T-H-E- E-N-O before a SWAT TEA,
          bullet tears into him. FIDGET falls and lands on the
          hood of his PARENTS' car as they exit the drive-in.

          HONEY, bald, bleeding, and burned, sees RAVEN and their
          eyes lock in friendship as RAVEN escapes into SATANIST
          FAN's car. RAVEN happily gives HONEY the extended index
          and little finger satanic sign and then turns it into a
          thumbs-up gesture of the future.

          HONEY blows RAVEN a kiss and then looks back at the
          CROWD in confusion and begins her long mad walk to
          paddy-wagon through FANS, ENEMIES, MOVIE AGENTS,
          LAWYERS, NEWS TEAMS, and dumbfounded LAW ENFORCEMENT
          OFFICERS who all want something from HONEY. As the
          soundtrack swells triumphantly over the din of jeers,
          applause, career advice, legal strategies and requests
          for autographs and interviews, HONEY begins to smile in
          full movie star insanity and waves and blows kisses to
          the CROWD as if she just won the Oscar.
