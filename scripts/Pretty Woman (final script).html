<b>          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - PATIO - EXTERIOR DAY
</b>
          We are in Philip Stuckey's residence on the Hollywood Hills.
          Apparently, a party is in progress.

                         
          Close Up on the Magician's hands and the hands of two ladies. The
          magician is doing tricks with coins in the ladies' hands.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan
           officer. Watch. One, two, three. See ?

                         
          On lady has got three coin in her hand, and the other one only
          one. The magician takes the three coins from the first lady's
          hand, and closes it. Then he takes the only coin from the other
          lady's hand, but leaves it open. He puts the four coins in his
          hand and closes it.

                         
          Credits appears in white capital letters on the screen.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           You've got it all, and we've got nothing. And you have all
           four. Just take a look.

          He opens his hand, which is empty. Then he opens the first lady's
          hand, which contains the four coins.

                         
                          WOMAN (voice over)
           Oh !

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           But I wouldn't trust you with real gold. That's why this
           one's only worth about a penny.

                         
          He takes one of the coins from the first lady's hand, hides it in
          his hand, and makes it appears again changed into a huge penny
          coin.

                         
          End of the first set of credits.

                         
                          MAN (voice over)
           Hmm.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           And if you wonder where the other one went, watch.

                         
          His left hand moves to the first lady's' ear, and gets the missing
          penny out of it.

                         

<b>                          PHILIP
</b>           A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ?

                         
          Philip Stuckey, the host, walks behind the magician. Philip is a
          short man in his forties, with receding hair. He looks, at the
          same time, obsequious and domineering. His guests laugh at his
          joke. Philip moves toward a young man.

                         
          The camera follows Philip.

                         

<b>                          PHILIP

</b>           No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

          He walks to a group of guest gathered around a large buffet table.
          Behind the table, the balustrade of the patio, and in the
          background, Hollywood Hills.

           somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

                         
          He turns to a charming lady talking with a man.

           Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at
           your beck and call.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           Well, that's the way you always make me feel. Maybe I
           should just move out.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD

           That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.

          Edward looks down, through the bay window, to the party still
          going on on the patio on the floor below. We can hear the chatter

          Elizabeth, Philip's wife, walks rapidly toward Philip's armchair
          and taps him on the shoulder. Elizabeth is a red-hair woman in her
          forties. She is still nice-looking, and very elegantly dressed,
          but she doesn't have anymore the attraction that a younger woman
          can have on Philip.

          With the street lights, we get a better view of Vivian. She is a
          young woman in her early twenties. She is very tall and slim. She
          is a beautiful woman, even though her prostitute outfit and heavy
          make-up makes her a little less beautiful than she actually is.
          She is wearing a red jacket and a man's very large cap on her
          blonde wig. Underneath the jacket she is wearing her very short
          sleeveless white top, which is attached to her also very short
          blue skirt with a big metal ring. She is carrying a big bag
          strapped on her shoulder.

          her cap off, but one still can see her strange outfit underneath
          the slightly open coat. She stares at a passing female guest who
          stares back at her.

</b>           Impressed ?

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           You kidding me ? I come here all the time. As a matter of
           fact, they do rent this room by the hour.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Sure they do.
          Edward has been taking a newspaper left by an attendant on a small
          table near the front door. He crosses the room and and drops the
          newspaper on the desk. He sits down behind the desk, and starts
          looking through his mail, while Vivian walks out on the terrace.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace)
           Wow, great view ! I bet you can see all the way to the
           ocean from out here.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there.

                         
          Vivian walks in the room through another French window-door on the
          other side of the desk. She puts her bag on an armchair.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Why don't you go out there ?

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           I'm afraid of heights.

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           You are ?

                         
          Edward nods his head.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           So how come you rented the penthouse ?

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the
           first floor, but I can't find one.

                         
          Vivian takes off Edward's coat and puts in on a sofa.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do
           with me ?

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           No ?

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           I hadn't exactly planned this.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Well, do you plan everything ?

                         
          She takes her red jacket off.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Always.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Yeah. Me too.
          She sits down on an armchair.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was
           a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of «fly by the
           seat of my pants» girl. You know, moment to moment. That's
           me. That's... Yeah.

                         
          Edward, still seated behind his desk, watches her with a strange
          look in his eyes. He suddenly realizes that perhaps he hasn't done
          something very wise in bringing Vivian with him.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe
           break the ice.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

                         
          He takes his wallet out of this jacket.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Cash works for me, yeah.

                         
          She stands up and walks to the desk. Edward puts the money on the
          desk. She takes the money and sits on the desk. She puts the money
          in one of her high boots.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           You're on my fax.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Well, that's one I haven't been on before.

                         
          She doesn't stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way.
          Edward takes his fax, but doesn't seem to react at Vivian's
          suggestive movements.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Cute. Very cute. Thank you.

                         
          She laughs, and zips one of her boots down. Out of the boot, she
          takes several condoms wrapped in cellophane paper.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I
           got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold
           circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and
           only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you
           say ? Hmm ?

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           A buffet of safety.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           I'm a safety girl.

                         
          Edward stands up from his desk. Immediately Vivian reaches for his
          zipper.

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           All right, let's get one of these on you.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           No, no. I...

                         
          He laughs awkwardly.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ?

                         
          He takes his jacket off, and puts it on the back of the desk
          chair.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh,
           business or pleasure ?

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Business, I think.

                         
          He walks away from the desk across the room.

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Business, you think.

                         
          She zips her boot back up, stands up and follows him across the
          room.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Well... let me guess.

                         
          Edward, now in his shirtsleeves, but still with his necktie and
          his vest on, has seated himself in an armchair.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           That would make you... a lawyer.

                         
          She sits downs on a low pouf in front of his armchair.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           A lawyer ?

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           What makes you think I'm a lawyer ?

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           I've known a lot of everybody.

                         
          The doorbell chimes. They both stand up.

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           What is that ?

                         
          He turns around and find his face very close to Vivian's face, and
          seems a little disturbed by it.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Champagne.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load
           off.

                         
          The doorbell chimes again.

                         
          Vivian runs across the room to the front door and opens it. A room
          service male attendant comes in carrying a loaded tray. Vivian
          closes the door behind him.

                         

<b>           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
</b>           Good evening.

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Hi.

                         

<b>           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
</b>           Uh, where would you like it ?

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Where would we like it ?

                         
          Edward has seated himself back in the armchair.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Uh, over by the bar.

                         
          The attendant seems a little surprised by Vivian's outfit, but,
          being a good luxury hotel attendant, he pretends not to notice,
          and carries the tray onto the bar. After he has put the tray down,
          he turns around and almost bumps into Vivian, who was standing
          behind him.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Excuse me !

                         
          She giggles.

                         

<b>           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
</b>           It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis.

</b>           Thank you.

                         
          The attendant doesn't move away and remains close to Vivian,
          staring at her.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           What are you looking at ?

                         
          The attendant clears his throat.

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           What is he looking at ?

                         
          Edward walks toward the attendant, and gives him some tip money.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

                         

<b>           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
</b>           Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night.

                         
          The attendant walks out of the room. Edward walks to the bar.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh.
           (in a much softer voice)
           Stupid.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Don't worry about it.
          Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           You mind if I take my boots off ?

                         
          She sits down on the steps that run across the room, separating it
          in two slightly different levels.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Not at all.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?

                         
          She zips one of her boots down.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           Where are they ? Shopping together ?

                         
          She takes her knee-length sock off. We hear the champagne bottle
          cork popping off.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD

           with my ex-dog.

                         
          He brings her a glass of Champagne, which he sets down on the
          floor besides her. Vivian is taking her other boot off.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           There you go.

                         
          He walks back to the bar to take his own glass.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of
           my apartment even as we speak.

                         
          He looks at her, a bit surprised.

                         
          Vivian is draining her glass empty. Edward comes near her, with a
          silver bowl in his hands. In the bowl are some fresh strawberries.

                         

<b>                          EDWARD

          He takes the lid off the bowl and shows it to her.

</b>           Oh, groovy.
          She takes a strawberry and eats it. Edward closes the bowl and
          brings it back on the bar. He sits down on a stool.

           okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it

          He stands up.

</b>           Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.

                         
          He takes the glass off her hand. She stands up.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN

           mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.

                         
          She walks to the bar, where Edward is filling the glass with
          Champagne.

           tonight.

                         
          He gives her the glass, and she immediately drinks it. He sits
          down on the stool.

<b>                          VIVIAN

          He doesn't answer immediately, remains pensive for a couple of
          seconds, and then looks at her. He laughs.

          Close Up on the sink, and Vivian's hands been washed. She turns
          the faucet off and takes an white towel to dry her hands.

                         
          The camera tilts up to Vivian's face, who walks to the door.

          Vivian hides something behind her back, but her hand in her back
          can be seen in one of the bathroom mirror.

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN

          He walks toward her and sighs. He grabs her by the arm and moves
          her toward the door. He takes her hand bag

          Close Up on Vivian's hand, which Edward is opening by force. She
          was hiding a little box of dental floss. Edward has put Vivian's
          bag under his arm.

          in his tracks, and looks at her. She turns around from the sink
          and looks at him.

          He nods his head. She goes back to the sink and brings a piece of
          dental floss to her mouth, stops, and brings it down. She turns
          around.

          Close Up shot on the TV screen, where an old black and white
          episode of «I love Lucy» is being played. It is episode 23 from
          Season 5, called «Lucy's Italian Movie». Lucy is standing close to
          a huge bucket full of grapes, and seems a bit reluctant to climb
          into it. Behind her, a fat Italian lady is speaking Italian to
          her.

                         
          We hear recorded laughs coming from the TV set.

                         
          The camera moves away from the TV set.

                         
          We hear Edward's voice speaking on the telephone.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Yes, that may be true, Vance.

                         
          We hear Vivian laughing.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Yes, I know, but I still need the numbers on Morse

          On the TV screen, the Italian fat lady is climbing into the bucket
          full of grapes.

                         
          The camera keeps on moving away from the TV set, and we discover
          Vivian sitting on the floor and drinking Champagne. And, behind
          her, we see Edward sitting on an armchair near a small table on
          which the telephone set is resting. Edward is writing on a
          document resting on his laps.

          Back on Vivian changing position and lying on her stomach to be
          more comfortable to watch TV. She laughs.

          Vivian is still lying on the floor, laughing. Edward sits down on

          Back to Vivian. We hear the recorded laughs coming from the TV
          set. Vivian stands up on her arms and knees and walks on all four
          toward the sofa.

          On the TV screen, Lucy now seems to be enjoying her grapes
          stomping.

                         
          Still resting on her knees, Vivian is taking her white top off her
          shoulders. She slips it down, and because the top is attached to
          the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing
          only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the
          skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated
          Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems
          surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the
          floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from
          the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it.

                         
          On the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the
          grapes, but the sound shuts off.

                         
          Back to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back
          on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his
          necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems
          surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig.

          She bends on his chest and starts kissing him on the chest, going
          down. She stops to look at the TV.

                         
          On the TV screen, the Italian lady is throwing grapes in Lucy's

          puts his towel around his neck. He bends on the armchair, and
          picks up one of Vivian's bracelet. The camera pans away from the

          including her blonde wig.

                         
          Edward looks at Vivian's things, then turns his head around toward

          He stops at the breakfast table, put some documents back in his

          Dennis speaks with a croaky voice, because Barney is slightly
          strangling him while buttoning his uniform.

          Barney moves away from Dennis and joins Vivian into the elevator.
          Dennis puts his hands on his collar to open it and be able to
          breathe properly.

           will help me.

                         
          Barney takes the money out of Vivian's hands, then takes a white
          handkerchief out of the breast pocket of his jacket and gives it
          to Vivian. Then he gives her her money back.

                         
          He walks around his desk, and picks up his telephone.

          blows her nose.

          Barney is going around a huge bunch of flowers, followed by two
          Japanese, one male and one female. The man is speaking Japanese to
          Barney. Vivian walks between them, carrying a garment bag over her

          around, expecting to see Vivian waiting for him. He starts walking
          again, still looking around him. Barney catches up with him.
          Edward doesn't stop walking, and Barney has to talk while walking.

          Edward stops at a marble shelf with a row of courtesy telephones
          on it. He hardly listens to what Barney is telling him.

          the bar. Even if we see only her back, we guess she is Vivian. But
          Edward doesn't seem to recognize her, because he keeps looking
          around for her.

                         
          As Edward is looking the other way from the bar, Vivian turns
          around and looks at him. Edward walks a couple of steps toward the
          door, and then turns around and eventually notices Vivian.

          Back to Vivian still seated at the bar. She doesn't look like the
          Vivian we were used to see. She is wearing a very elegant dark-
          colored cocktail dress. Her hair also has been very elegantly
          styled.
          Edward looks at her without moving for a few seconds.

                         
          She stands up from the bar and walks toward him.

          On the plate, four appetizers, actually four canapés.

           Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a
           company...

                         
          The camera moves up from the plate to the guest's face. The guest
          is Vivian, and she looks a bit worried by what has been brought to
          her.

                         
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)

          David looks at Vivian, a bit surprised by what she just said.

                         
          Edward whispers to Vivian

                         

<b>                          EDWARD

          David smiles.

                         
          Vivian takes one of her forks and looks at it, then she puts it
          back.

                         
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)
           Let me, uh, put it another way. Between your public
           statements and the rumors flying around on this thing, we
           find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions
           are.

                         
          Sensing Vivian's embarrassment, James Morse smiles to her.

                         

<b>                          JAMES MORSE

           which goes with what !

                         
          He points to the different forks around his plate. Vivian laughs.

                         
          David seems a bit annoyed by the fact that the conversation keeps
          on deviating on menial subjects.

                         
          James Morse takes one of the canapés with his fingers and eats it.
          Vivian smiles, and also takes the canapé with her fingers. She
          wipes something out of it before eating it.

                         
          Edward smiles. He is happy that Vivian and James are getting along
          so well.

                         
          Close Up on the table in front of Vivian. We see the waiter's hand
          putting down a plate of snails in their shells.
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)
           You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of
           cities. Men like my grandfather made this country.

                         
          Vivian looks at the snails and then at the waiter.

          Vivian is trying to figure out how to work the snail pincers.

           sale.

          pincers.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are
           going to be a very rich man.

                         
          James Morse looks at Edward.

          Eventually, Vivian had succeeded in fitting one snail into the
          snail pincers, but it flies away from the pincers.
          The waiter, a white-hair man with a gentle face, catches it.

                         
          Edward looks at the waiter and then at Vivian.

          Close Up on the TV screen. We see the closing scene of the film
          «Charade», directed in 1963 by musical comedy actor Stanley Donen.

          We sense that Vivian feels like crying, but she masters her
          emotions and looks at Philip.

          followed by Vivian.
          Vivian closes the door, and Edward looks at his mail lying on a
          small table. Vivian throws her hat and gloves on another table
          with a nervous movement. Edward turns around to look at her.

          sullen, sad face. Edward doesn't move for a couple of seconds,
          then walks to the bed, to pick up his jacket. He gets his wallet
          from the inside pocket of his jacket. He opens the wallet, and

          Medium close shot on Vivian. We hear the penthouse door opening,
          but Vivian doesn't look at it and keeps looking at the elevator in
          front of her.
          Larger shot. Edward is coming out of the penthouse, and he has
          left the door open. He walks toward Vivian.

</b>           I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us.
           It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you
           to go. Will you stay the week ?

          The elevator bell dings. The elevator door opens, and a smiling
          Dennis appears.

          Dennis feels some tension between Edward and Vivian and stops
          smiling. He goes back into the elevator, presses a button and the
          door closes.

          They look at each other for a couple of seconds, then slowly,
          Vivian walks back to the penthouse. Edward follows her and takes
          one of her handbags from her shoulder. They both enters the
          penthouse and he closes the door behind him.

           made it sound so great. So one day I did it.

                         
          The camera stops moving forward, having reached a medium close
          shot, showing Vivian and Edward's heads and shoulders.

          box and looks into it. What she sees looks like a very beautiful
          and expensive necklace. She moves her hand to touch delicately the
          necklace, but Edward snaps the lid of the box shut, almost
          squeezing her finger into it.

          The camera pans, from right to left, a succession of private boxes

          Medium full shot on the limousine parked on the curb in front of
          the building. Darryl is standing near the car. Edward gives his
          briefcase to Darryl.

          Close shot on Vivian's bare feet walking on the rug. The door bell
          is chiming. Vivian puts down a large hat box on the floor, and she
          walks to the front door. The camera tilts up and we see her full
          body. She is wearing the same dark pink suit she was wearing when
          she was with Kit by the swimming-pool. She opens the door to
          Philip.

                         
          Close up shot on Vivian's face : she doesn't seem very happy to

          He walks in without waiting for Vivian to invite him in.

                         
          He chuckles. Vivian closes the front door.

          She sits down on the sofa, crosses her legs on the couch and
          starts writing in a notebook. Behind him, Philip sits down on a
          stool near the bar.

          Medium shot on Philip at the bar. He stands up and slowly walks
          toward her. The camera follows him.

           you are not... the little woman.

                         
          He sits down on the sofa, next to Vivian. She uncrosses her legs
          and lets them down on the floor. He puts his glass on the low
          table, crosses his fingers and snickers.

                         

<b>                          PHILIP

          She puts her notebook on the low table.

          He moves slightly closer to her. She seems very tense by the
          situation.

           huh...

                         
          He puts his hand between her legs. She moves it away.

          He keeps on trying to fondle her, and Vivian keeps on trying to
          get rid of him.

          Edward, who has come silently into the room, grabs him from
          behind, and forces him to stand up.

          hand, who seems to hurt him after the violent punch he gave to

          He picks up Philip's briefcase and throws it through the open
          door. It falls on the floor of the hallway.

          taking the cubes out of the box. The other hand, the one which hit
          Philip, is wrapped in a white napkin. He puts the cubes in another
          white napkin and wraps the napkin around the cubes.

          We see Edward's hand holding the napkin with the ice inside. He

          The camera moves slowly away, widening the shot, and showing
          Edward in shirtsleeves bending over Vivian, without her jacket,

          Kit stands up, puts the Teddy Bear down, and walks toward her.
          Vivian takes some money out of her pocket. She puts the money in

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           So what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued
           her ?

                         

<b>                          VIVIAN
</b>           She rescues him right back.

                         
          Slowly, their mouth meet, and they kiss passionately.

                         
          Full shot of Vivian's hotel and the emergency exit. On the steps
          between the top landing and the one below, we see Edward and
          Vivian kissing passionately.

                         
          End of La Traviata music.

                         
          We hear the voice of the Afro-American man we saw at the beginning
          of the film, crossing Hollywood Boulevard.

                         
           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)
           Welcome to Hollywood. What's your dream ?

                         
          The camera moves away from the hotel and we see the Afro-American
          man coming down the street

<b>                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN
</b>           Everybody comes here. This is Hollywood, the land of
           dreams.

                         
          He crosses the street.

                         

<b>                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN
</b>           Some dreams come true, some don't. But keep on dreaming.

                         
          The picture moves away to the right of the screen, to be replaced
          by a full black screen.

                         
           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)
           This is Hollywood. Always time to dream, so keep on
           dreaming.

                         
          The credits start rolling up while we hear the song «Pretty
          Woman», performed by Roy Orbison.

                         

<b>                          LYRICS
</b>           Pretty woman, Walking down the street. Pretty woman, The
           kind I like to meet. Pretty woman, I don't believe you.
           You're not the truth. No one could look as good as you.
           Mercy. Pretty woman won't you pardon me. Pretty woman I
           couldn't help but see, Pretty woman, That you look lovely
           as can be. Are you lonely just like me. Oh, pretty woman.

                         
          End of music.

                         
          A short silence, and then we hear the song «No Explanation»,
          performed by Peter Cetera.

                         

<b>                          LYRICS
</b>           You really took me by surprise. You're someone I've needed
           for a lifetime. Your heart was cleverly disguised, And it
           didn't look that way in my mind. Tell me how could it be. I
           was the last to know. Darling, I couldn't read what was in
           your mind, To turn around and love me, With no Explanation.
           I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would
           take it With sweet consideration. And after all that we've
           been through, I can't believe it's true Until I hear you
           say. Ooh ! I know now, now, now. Ah ! No explanation. I
           gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would
           take it.

                         
          The music slowly fades out

                         
          End of credits.
