</b><b>EXT. ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY
</b>
Endless barren landscape. No sign of life. The atmosphere
is hazy, toxic-looking. Volcanoes erupt. Meteors bombard.
Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools of water. Silence.

<b>INT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
<b>SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CA, FOUR BILLION AND FORTY YEARS LATER
</b>
Beamed ceilings and ostentatious fireplace. A few birthday
cards on the mantel, two of them identical: "To Our Dear Son
on His Fortieth Birthday." Charlie Kaufman, a fat, balding
man in a purple sweater with tags still attached, paces the
room. His incantational voice-over carpets the scene.

</b>          I am old. I am fat. I am bald. My
          toenails have turned strange. I am
          repulsive. How repulsive? I don't know
          for I suffer from a condition called Body
          Dysmorphic Disorder. I am fat, but am I
          as fat as I think? My therapist says no,
          but people lie. I believe others call me
          Fatty behind my back. Or Fatso. Or,
          facetiously, Slim. But I also believe
          this is simply my own perverted form of
          self-aggrandizement, that no one really
          talks about me at all. What possible

          anyone? I am repulsive. I have never

</b>
A lonely two-lane highway cutting through swampland.

<b>                    BRITISH NARRATOR
</b>          As natural selection works solely by and
          for the good of each being, all corporeal
          and mental endowments will tend to
          progress towards perfection.

Suddenly, a beat-up white van barrels around a curve.   It's
followed closely by an old green Ford.

<b>SUBTITLE: STATE ROAD 29, FLORIDA, FIVE YEARS EARLIER
</b>
<b>INT. WHITE VAN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
John Laroche drives. He's a skinny man with no front teeth.
The van is piled with bags of potting soil, gardening junk.
A Writings of Charles Darwin audio cassette case is on the
seat next to Laroche.

</b>          It is interesting to contemplate an
          entangled bank, clothed with many plants
          of many kinds, with birds singing...

Laroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing
by. Almost too late, he spots the Fakahatchee Strand State
Preserve sign and makes a squealing right onto the dirt road
turn-off. The cassette case flies from the seat and half-
buries itself in an open bag of peat.

<b>INT. GREEN FORD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Nirvana blasts. Russell, Vinson, and Randy, three young
Indian men, pass a joint and watch the erratic van ahead.

They share a stoned laugh.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
<b>SUBTITLE: NEW YORK, TWO YEARS LATER
</b>
Late night street. The click-click of typing. We move
slowly up the building to the only glowing window.

<b>                    ORLEAN (O.S.)
</b>              (wistful)
          John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a
          stick, pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and
          sharply handsome despite the fact that he
          is missing all his front teeth.

In the window, lit by a single desk lamp, a woman types.

<b>INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
We glide over the desk piled with books about orchids, past a
photo of Laroche tacked to an overwhelmed bulletin board, and
come to rest on a woman typing. It's Susan Orlean: pale,
delicate and blond. We lose ourselves in her melancholy
beauty. She turns to the camera and talks to us.

          Laroche after reading a small article

<b>INT. RANGER'S TRUCK - MID-MORNING
</b>
Tony, a ranger, drives along a dirt road past the Fakahatchee
Strand State Preserve sign and enters the swamp. He sees the
white van and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license
plate on the Ford. He pulls over down the road, and whispers
into his C.B.

<b>                    TONY
</b>          We got a Seminole, or Seminoles, in the
          swamp. I'm on Janes Scenic Drive just
          east of Logging Road Twelve. I repeat,
          Indians in the swamp.

Tony waits for a response.   Nothing.

                    TONY (cont'd)
          Indians in the swamp.

Nothing still.   Tony clears his throat into the radio.

<b>                    RADIO VOICE
</b>          I don't know what you want me to say.

<b>                    TONY
</b>          Barry, Indians do not go on swamp walks.
          If there are Indians in the swamp, they
          are in there for a reason.

No response. Tony glowers, gets out of the truck, watches
the vehicles through binoculars. Nothing. He straightens
his cap. Mosquitoes land on his neck, his nose, his lips.

<b>INT. L.A. BUSINESS LUNCH RESTAURANT - MIDDAY
</b>
Kaufman, wearing his purple sweater sans tags, sits with
Valerie, an attractive woman in wire-rim glasses. They pick
at salads. Kaufman steals glances at her lips, her hair, her
breasts. She looks up at him. He blanches, looks away.

<b>                     KAUFMAN (V.O.)
</b>          I'm old.   I'm bald. I'm repulsive.

Valerie absently rubs her nose.      Kaufman self-consciously
rubs his nose in response.

<b>                       VALERIE
</b>             And we're thrilled you're interested.

Valerie rubs her nose again. Kaufman pulls at his nostril.
A rivulet of sweat slides down his forehead. Valerie watches
it. Kaufman sees her watching it. She sees him seeing her
watching it. She looks at her salad. He quickly swabs.

<b>                       KAUFMAN
</b>             Oh, thanks, wow. That's nice to hear.

Kaufman's brow is dripping again.      He smiles, embarrassed.

<b>                       KAUFMAN
</b>             Sort of hot in here.

             tell me your thoughts on this crazy
             little project of ours.

In one motion, Kaufman swabs his forehead and pulls a book
entitled The Orchid Thief from his bag.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          First, I think it's a great book.

Kaufman nods, flips through the book, stalling. There's a
smiling author photo of Susan Orlean on the inside back
cover.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          And Orlean makes orchids so fascinating.
          Plus her musings on Florida, orchid
          poaching. Indians. Great, sprawling New
          Yorker stuff. I'd want to remain true to
          that, let the movie exist rather than be
          artificially plot driven.

<b>                    VALERIE
</b>          Okay, great, great. I guess I'm not
          exactly sure what that means.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          It's just, I don't want to compromise by
          making it a Hollywood product. An orchid
          heist movie. Or changing the orchids
          into poppies and turning it into a movie
          about drug running. Y'know?

<b>                    VALERIE
</b>          Oh, of course. We agree.        Definitely.

          guns. Or characters learning profound
          life lessons. Or characters growing or
          characters changing or characters
          learning to like each other or characters
          overcoming obstacles to succeed in the
          end. Y'know? Movie shit.

Kaufman is sweating like crazy now.       Valerie is quiet for a
moment.

<b>                    MARGARET

The Indians ignore him. They trudge. Laroche spots
something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree. He
stops, circles the tree. His eyes widen in reverent awe.

The Indians come around. Laroche stares at a single
beautiful, glowing white flower hanging from the tree.   He
tenderly caresses the petals. Then, business-like:

Kaufman pulls a bunch of orchid books off the shelf, carries
them to the register, along with a book on Hegel, which
features an engraving of the philosopher on the cover.
Kaufman waits in line and watches the tattooed female cashier
flirting with the handsome guy ahead of him. He studies
their interaction, the way she looks at him. Her eyes, her
lips. The guy leaves and the cashier waves Kaufman over. As
she rings him up, she expresses no interest in him. He's
hurt and fixates on a sexy flower tattoo on her arm. She
catches him, pulls down her sleeve.

          Five kinds of bromeliad, one peperomia,
          nine orchid varieties. About a hundred

             familiar, I'm sure, with the State of

Tony nods, even though he has no idea.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             So you know that even though Seminole
             Chief Billie killed a Florida panther,
             one of, what, forty in the entire world?

Laroche looks to the Indians for confirmation.       They give it.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          The state couldn't successfully prosecute
          him. Because he's an Indian and it's his
          right. As repugnant as you or I as white

climbs the stairs.

Kaufman sits at a card table, picking at a salad and reading
an orchid book. Donald lies on the floor, chomping a hoagie

</b>          Maybe you should watch what you eat,

          you're a bit fat? Does it ever occur to
          you, you kind of represent me in the
          world? That people look at you and

<b>INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

Orlean drives on State Road 29, past prefab housing, into
swampland. She talks to us.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          Florida is a landscape of transition and
          mutation, a hybrid of unruliness and
          orderliness, nature and artifice.

She brushes a wisp of hair from her face and tucks it behind
her small, pretty ear. We linger on the ear, which grows
pink with sunlight. Orlean catches us and smiles shyly.

<b>INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Kaufman traces a stubby, nail-bitten finger along State Road
29 along a Florida road map. He turns to his typewriter, and
types in a clumsy hunt-and-peck style.

<b>                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
</b>          We open on State Road 29. A lonely
          stretch of road cutting through untamed
          swampland. Suddenly a beat-up white van
          barrels around a curve. It's driver: a
          skinny man with no front teeth...

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          Okay, I've been a professional
          horticulturist for twelve years. I've
          owned a plant nursery of my own which was
          destroyed by the hurricane. I'm a

          at least sixty lectures on the

          author, both in magazine and book form.
          I have extensive experience with orchids,
          and the asexual micropropagation of
          orchids under aseptic cultures.   This is
          laboratory work, not at all like your

As she rings up his books, Kaufman admires the cashier's
flower tattoo. She catches him and smiles with red, wet,
pierced lips. She unbuttons her blouse and shows him a breast
with a heart tattoo. A sweet heartbeat turns to knocking.

Kaufman, in bed masturbating, looks up at the closed door.

          Okay, there's this serial killer, right --

Kaufman groans, lies down, pulls the covers over his face.

<b>                    DONALD (CONT'D)
</b>          No, wait. See, he's being hunted by a
          cop. And he's taunting the cop, right?
          Sending clues who his next victim is.
          He's already holding her hostage in his
          creepy basement. So the cop gets
          obsessed with figuring out her identity,
          and in the process he falls in love with
          her. Even though he's never even met
          her. She becomes, like, the

          out the killer suffers from multiple
          personality disorder. Okay? See, he's
          really also the cop and the girl. All of
          them. It's all him! Isn't that crazy?

Donald waits, proud.    Kaufman pulls off the covers.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          Look, the only idea more overused than
          serial killers, is multiple personality.
          On top of that you explore the notion
          that cop and criminal are really two
          aspects of the same person. See every

Kaufman exits.

<b>EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

Orlean exits the courthouse and watches Laroche in a huddle
with Lerner, Vinson, and Buster Baxley, vice-president of the
tribe's business operations. They're all smoking intently.

Buster waves a dismissive hand at Lerner, walks away. Vinson
shrugs, stubs his cigarette, follows Buster. Lerner and
Laroche stand there a moment. Lerner walks off. Laroche
cracks his neck. A charmingly shy Orlean approaches.

that she's writing "Judge can screw herself."

MUSIC: lush, profound orchestral piece.

A glorious orange, large-petalled orchid blooms in dramatic
time-lapse. We slowly, lovingly circle the flower.

and lost, sitting across the yard smoking.

one hand against the dashboard.

He looks at her and smiles. Orlean smiles back and

to watch the road. He doesn't take the hint.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             The plan was, get the Indians to pull it
             from the swamp. I researched it. As

Old black and white footage, taken from up high, of two 19th

The camera swoops down, close to the men. As it does, the

mannequins, the horse becomes papier-mache: it's a display.
A live man in modern work clothes is arranging actual orchids

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          Nothing. I just read about that Swamp
          Ape that supposedly lives in the swamp?
          Like bigfoot? You should put that in

There are now many turtles in aquariums. Many turtle books
and posters. The boy, in a turtle T-shirt, looks out the
window into the darkness. His eyes are troubled.

The boy comes downstairs. His father, in his backbrace,
watches TV; his sister lies on the couch, semi-conscious,
more pale than before. His mother pats the girl's head with
a damp cloth. There's a little Hindu altar with candles.

The boy nods his head solemnly.

          One looks like that girl in high school
          with creamy skin. One has eyes that
          dance. One has eyes that contain the
          sadness of the world.

He is sick with adoration for the women, who pay him no mind.

          Nothing in science can account for the

fast and unintentionally. He quickly shifts back to her
face. His therapist wraps her shawl around her.

</b>          Every one of these flowers has a specific
          relationship with the insect that
          pollinates it. There's an orchid that
          looks exactly like this particular
          insect. So the bug humps the flower and
          gets covered with its pollen. Thusly...

Laroche mimes humping.

<b>                      ORLEAN
</b>          I get it.

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          That's called pseudo-copulation. These
          flowers are smart! You gotta fall in
          love with them. Once you learn anything
          about orchids, you'll devote your life to
          learning everything about them.

Orlean looks around: people sniffing flowers, feeling petals,
staring deep into nectaries. People jabber passionately,
people buy plants, people carry boxes of purchased plants.
Orlean looks deeply into various flowers, at a dizzying array
of colors and shapes, but remains detached.

<b>INT. APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

Orlean stares at photos of orchids on her bulletin board.
She can't find a way in. She looks over at her husband
reading. He smiles at her. She smiles back, but there's a
terrible distance between them. She looks at us sadly.

</b>          I wanted to want something as much as
          people wanted these plants but it isn't
          part of my constitution.

Orlean stares out the window at the empty street below.   A
plastic bag dips and rises in the breeze. She inhales.

                    ORLEAN (cont'd)
          I suppose I do have one unembarrassed
          passion.

The seven year old girl swings sadly by herself. From high
up she sees her mother in a window at one end of the house,
her father in a window at the other end. Both stare blankly
in opposite directions. The swing completes it's arc and the
girl descends, losing sight of her parents.

          we have to realize we all write in a

           But, anyway, it was a godsend.

Laroche scarfs his pie.    Orlean watches him.

Alligators regard them menacingly.

The scene turns into color. The men turn into mannequins.
The floor is covered with black cellophane representing swamp

Laroche smiles back at his mother. A screech of tires and
another car crashes head on into theirs. Laroche's face
smacks against the steering wheel, his front teeth fly in all
directions. His mother rockets forward smashing through the
windshield. His uncle hits Laroche's wife in the head,

          all those Indian rights issues are so
          complex. There are valid arguments on
          both sides. I mean we took their land!
          We gave them smallpox!

          aren't allowed to do that. They all
          plead no contest. Laroche got fined five
          hundred bucks and banned from the

</b>          Now the Fakahatchee is the largest of all

          who've walked too long in the swamp.

<b>INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Orlean types. It's pouring and sheets of rain beat against
her window. She glances at her husband, across the room
reading a book. She sighs, continues typing.

</b>          What I didn't say to him is that life
          seemed to be filled with things that were
          just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful
          to imagine and easy to fall in love with
          but a little fantastic and fleeting and
          out of reach.

<b>INT. RENTAL CAR - EVENING
</b>
Kaufman drives down a Florida strip-malled highway. He
passes a Barnes and Noble, a Burger King, a Starbucks. He
parks in front of a California Pizza Kitchen.

<b>INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN (FLORIDA) - EVENING
</b>
Kaufman watches the waitresses. One approaches his booth.
Her name badge reads: Caryn, Tampa, FL. She smiles at
Kaufman as she looks right through him.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A morose Kaufman sits on the bed reading The Orchid Thief.

Kaufman is deeply moved. He hi-lites the passage, then looks
at the smiling photo of Orlean. He finds himself lost in it.

Orlean, dirty from the swamp, is on the phone.

Laroche, wearing a Cleveland Indians T-shirt, drives crazily
thorugh the Hollywood Seminole reservation. Orlean holds on.

Laroche swerves into a parking space in the nursery lot.

</b>
Laroche and Orlean get out of the van.

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          I've got all the right qualities. While

A few young Indian guys are hauling bags of potting soil.
They look at Laroche sourly. Laroche indicates the giant
cartoon Indian on his T-shirt.

          Or, I don't know, "Collector of Hearts"
          or something.

Before Orlean can respond, Laroche picks up the phone and
dials an impossibly long number. He waits, gestures for
Orlean to sit on a chair piled high with junk.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          You won't hurt anything.

Orlean moves the junk over, shares the seat with it.

Laroche weaves through traffic.   Orlean holds on.

Gray skies. Kaufman drives his rental car: he looks at the
Seminole Nursery, the Collier County Courthouse, Laroche's
house. He drives through swampy terrain. He walks around at
an orchid show, he attends a slide-show orchid lecture. It's
all dull. He ends up sitting on a bench on an empty beach,
staring out at the ocean.

Orlean rolls her eyes.

<b>                    ORLEAN

Orlean is silent, taps her fingers on the bedside table.

Laroche hangs up. Orlean sits there for a moment, flips
through her list of orchid collector names.

<b>EXT. EMPTY BEACH - DAY

Kaufman sits on the bench, looking out at the ocean. An
attractive, spandexed couple skate by, chatting in German.
He watches the woman, hoping for a look, for something. He
doesn't get it. They're gone. A tan older man sits on the
bench, lights a cigarette. Kaufman continues to look at the
ocean, even though he feels the guy's eyes on him. He
doesn't want to engage.

          It's about a mob guy, but it's not your

          mob guy's cheating on her. But the truth
          is, the cop's lying because he wants her

No response.   Kaufman tries to make it interesting.

          It's about this poacher who steals
          orchids out of a swamp.

</b>          Cool! Hey, my script's going amazing!
          Right now I'm working out an Image
          System. Bob calls it an invaluable
          asset. Because of my multiple
          personality theme, I've chosen the motif
          of broken mirrors to show my
          protagonist's fragmented self. Bob
          teaches that an Image System greatly
          increases the complexity of an aesthetic
          emotion.

back and forth. He looks over at the clock. It's 3:32.

</b>          Damn it.

Donald snores happily off-screen.   Kaufman switches on a
lamp, pulls The Orchid Thief from his bag, flips through it.
There are now many yellow hi-lited passages. He reads one.

<b>                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
</b>          There are too many ideas and things and
          people, too many directions to go. I was
          starting to believe the reason it matters
          to care passionately about something is
          that it whittles the world down to a more
          manageable size.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          Such sweet, sad insights.   So true.

Kaufman flips to the glowing, smiling author photo.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          And you're... I like looking at you.

He stares at the photo.   Its smile broadens.    It talks.

</b>          I like looking at you, too.   Charlie.

The photo smiles warmly at him.   Kaufman begins to jerk-off.
He closes his eyes.

Then: Kaufman and Orlean are in his bed together, making
love. She smiles at him throughout. They finish.

Then: Kaufman is alone in bed, heaving. He looks at the
still smiling photo. It somehow seems sleepy now.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          I don't know how to do this. I'm afraid
          I'll disappoint you. You've written a

          beautiful, haunted by loneliness, typing

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Orlean drives through swampy landscape.   She talks to us.


<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          I suppose what I'd been doing in Florida
          was trying to understand how people found
          order and contentment and a sense of
          purpose in the universe by fixing their
          sighs on one single desire. Now I was
          also trying to understand how someone
          could end such intense desire without a
          trace.

Orlean stops at a payphone and dials.   It rings for a while.

</b>          So, how's everything going?

<b>                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
</b>          Great! I'm training myself on the
          internet. It's fascinating. I'm doing
          pornography. It's amazing how much these

Kaufman holds The Orchid Thief open with one hand and types
with the other.

          "Florida is a landscape of transition and

wrong page and sees an About The Author paragraph. The last
line jumps off the page: "She now lives in New York City with
her husband."

          young girl swings alone in the backyard.
          From high in the air she sees her parents
          in separate rooms staring blankly in
          opposite directions. This symbolizes the
          profound scarring their waning passion
          has had on the girl's psyche, how she
          became afraid to ever really love
          something because it would go away.

Kaufman is immensely pleased.    He smiles at Orlean's photo.

Black and white shot of Laroche and the Indians slogging
through Fakahatchee. The camera swoops down and the scene
turns into a mannequin version.

It's an enormous hall filled with people setting up elaborate
displays.   Martin Motes and his assistant work on the
Laroche display. Orlean watches them. Motes looks up.

Kaufman grabs Donald's script and throws it on his bed.

          changed it a little. Now the killer cuts
          off body pieces and makes the victims eat

Kaufman collapses, puts his head in his hands.

</b>          I don't think so. But it's cool for my

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

The lights are off.   Orlean is in bed, sleeping fitfully.

Out the window he sees colorful fireworks far down below,
like small flowers blooming on the black earth. His eyes
well with tears.

Orlean walks through alone, panicked. All the vegetation is
greener and crazier-looking than we've seen before. Things
slither by in the water, brush up against her.

She tenses, steps into a sinkhole, flails, gets tangled in a
vine, which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate
herself. She falls face forward into the black water.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Orlean snaps awake, bedcovers tangled around her legs. She
heaves, looks at the clock. It's 3:30. She stares at the
ceiling. She looks at the clock again. It's 3:30. She
looks at the clock again. It's 4:10. She closes her eyes.
She opens them, looks at the clock, the room is filled with
murky water, the bed an island of dryness. An alligator
pokes its nose out of the water, begins to climb onto the
bed. Orlean jumps back, hits her head on the headboard. The
room is back to normal. The clock reads 4:23. She closes
her eyes. The alarm goes off.

<b>EXT. LAROCHE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Orlean pulls up to the curb where Laroche stands, dressed in
a short sleeve shirt, thin pants, and his Miami Hurricanes
hat. He opens the door and climbs in.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          Where are our supplies?

<b>                    LAROCHE

Laroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket.
Orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering
wheel. Laroche shrugs.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          Look, don't worry about it. We'll get
          crap at the Indian trading post on
          Alligator Alley. Hey, want me to drive?

<b>INT. CAR - A BIT LATER
</b>
The sun has come up strong. It looks hot. Laroche speeds
along with one finger on the wheel, paying little attention
to the road. The car veers onto the shoulder, he lazily
corrects it. Orlean is tense.

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          I remember one time when I was a kid,
          fifteen or so, my mother and I came to
          the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to
          photograph. We walked for hours, through
          the most intense heat I'd ever felt.   We
          couldn't find one. I wanted to turn
          back. But my mom said, no.

          past the absolute certainty that you'll
          never find it, if you keep searching past
          that, there it'll be. So we walked. I
          had goddamn bloody blisters on my feet.
          And we found ourselves in this charred
          prairie, desolate, sun blasted, y'know.
          And there in the middle of it was this
          one gorgeous, snowy Polyrrhiza lindenii.

They drive in silence for a little while.   She watches him.

Orlean types at her desk.   She turns to us and talks.

<b>                    ORLEAN

          hopeful journey through darkness into
          light. I never thought many people in
          the world were like John, but I was
          realizing more and more that Laroche was
          an extreme, not an aberration -- most
          people in some way or another do strive
          for something exceptional, something to
          pursue, even at their peril, rather than
          abide an ordinary life.

<b>EXT. MIDTOWN NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
Kaufman, sweaty and anxious, walks along. He arrives at the
New Yorker building and enters with steely determination.

<b>INT. BUILDING - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Kaufman waits for the elevator, sweating even more profusely.
The elevator doors open. People get off, people get on, the
elevator doors close. Kaufman still stands there.

<b>EXT. SWAMP - MORNING
</b>
Laroche and Orlean step off the levee into black water. They
sink to their knees. The ground is soft; it's a struggle to
pull their feet up to walk. Things slither past in the
water. Something big runs by in the distance. Bees, and
dragonflies hover. Gnats and mosquitoes bite. Birds
screech. Frogs croak. Laroche points to a yellow flower.

              (pointing to another orchid)
          Rigid Epidendrum. That's an ugly-ass
          orchid. But I'm no snob. I'm interested
          in all orchids. Not just pretty ones.

<b>INT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER

A miserable Kaufman sits in the window, sipping coffee and
watching the New Yorker building across the street. He
steels himself, exits the coffee shop.

<b>INT. ELEVATOR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
Kaufman rides up in the crowded elevator. It stops a few
times; people get off and on. Kaufman sweats. The doors
open. The New Yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite
the elevator. Nobody gets off or on. The doors close. The
elevator continues up. Kaufman hates himself. Soon the
elevator is emptied out with the exception of Kaufman. It
begins its descent and stops once again at the New Yorker.
This time Orlean gets on. Kaufman is absolutely panicked.
Orlean looks at him blankly, presses "lobby", and faces
front. Kaufman sweats, studies the back of her head. The
elevator arrives at the lobby. Orlean gets out. Kaufman
hesitates, then follows.

Orlean walks along.   Kaufman follows her.

The waitress nods and leaves.   Kaufman scribbles.

<b>EXT. SWAMP - NOON

Orlean follows Laroche. She watches him start off in one
direction, stop, start off another direction, then go
straight ahead. Orlean seems depressed.

<b>                    ORLEAN

the New Yorker building. Kaufman waits outside.

The sun is hot. Laroche is twenty feet ahead of Orlean. She
watches him march forward with great authority. She massages
her eyebrows, leaving a residue of dirt on her face.

Kaufman reviews his notes.       He is sweaty and wild-eyed.

stares at him. Laroche won't look at her. He busies himself
opening the backpack and pulling out food. Finally, Laroche
speaks without looking up.

<b>                       LAROCHE
</b>             We're not lost.

Laroche takes out a cigarette, lights it.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             I'm just turned around a little.

He looks up at her, sees her staring at him. He pokes around
on the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             A sundial. I'll just set this up, wait a
             few minutes, and we'll be able to tell
             which way the sun is moving. We want to
             be heading southeast.

Laroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it.

                        LAROCHE (cont'd)
             This is no big deal. You should eat
             something.

Orlean takes a cracker. This relaxes Laroche. He stretches
his legs, knocks over the twig. Without looking at Orlean,
he puts the twig back.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             So do you collect anything?

</b>                 (non-responsive)
             Not really.

<b>                       ORLEAN
</b>             The sundial isn't working.

Laroche looks down at it.

<b>                       LAROCHE
</b>             It is so working.

Orlean stares at the twig in the ground. She looks at
Laroche. Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean. Rage and
panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls.
Her eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her
brain. Laroche seems unaware.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             The thing about computers. The thing I
             like is that I'm immersed in it but it's
             not a living thing that's going to leave
             or die or something. I prefer having the
             minimum number of living things to worry
             about in my life.

Orlean's anger softens.    She looks sadly at Laroche.

<b>                       ORLEAN
</b>             So, John...

<b>                       LAROCHE
</b>             Okay, fuck the sundial. We'll just go
             straight and eventually we'll get there.

They rise.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             What I mean is we'll get somewhere. Out
             of here. I mean, logically, we have to
             get out as long as we walk straight.

Laroche points them in a direction and they walk.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Kaufman is sleeping. It looks like it's been a rough night.
The phone rings. He reaches for it.

<b>                        KAUFMAN

<b>                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)

          Valerie's breathing down my neck.

<b>                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
</b>          Your brother's script. It's tight,
          inventive. A smart, edgy thriller. The

<b>EXT. NYC STREETS (MONTAGE) - MORNING
</b>
Kaufman wanders. He eyes other sad-looking, balding,
overweight men wandering the streets also.

<b>                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)
</b>             I am fat. I can't write. I am
             repulsive. I am old. I have
             accomplished nothing. I am just one more
             old, fat, bald man on the street.

<b>EXT. SWAMP - DAY
</b>
Laroche leads the way. There's a sadness, a sense of defeat
and humiliation that he tries to conceal. Orlean is stony.

<b>                       LAROCHE
</b>             I've done this a million times. Whenever
             everything's killing me, I just say to
             myself, screw it, and go straight ahead.

Laroche leads Orlean back into the brush.

<b>EXT. NYC STREET - MORNING
</b>
Kaufman sees a white school building ahead, glowing in the
sun. He walks toward it.

<b>INT. LOBBY - MORNING
</b>
The lobby of an auditorium, crowded with enthusiastic people
signing up for something. Kaufman waits in line.    He
watches the handsome guy ahead of him flirt with an
attractive female registrar. The guy moves on and the
attractive registrar looks without interest at Kaufman.

<b>                       REGISTRAR
</b>             May I help you?

Kaufman averts his eyes from her cool gaze; they come to rest
on a pile of McKee's book Story next to her.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            86.
</b>


<b>INT. AUDITORIUM - A BIT LATER
</b>
Kaufman sits in the packed room.   McKee paces the stage with
a mic clipped to his lapel.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          Years from now you'll be standing around
          a posh cocktail party congratulating
          yourself on how you spent an entire
          weekend locked in a room with an asshole,
          an opinionated arrogant asshole, for your
          art.

The audience laughs, except for Kaufman who looks pained.

<b>                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
</b>          I am pathetic. I am a loser.    I am fat.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          So... what is the substance of writing?
          Nothing as trivial as words is at the
          heart of this great art, my friends.

McKee continues to talk but his voice goes under.

<b>                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
</b>          I have failed. I am panicked. I am fat.
          I have sold out. I am worthless. I...

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          Literary talent is not enough. First,
          last, and always, the imperative is to
          tell a story.

Kaufman watches with disdain as people take notes.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          Twenty three hundred years ago, Aristotle
          said, when storytelling goes bad in a
          society, the result is decadence.
              (deadpan)
          Well, just look around you.

Everyone, except Kaufman, laughs giddily at McKee's joke.

                    MCKEE (cont'd)
          Aristotle also said: A story must have a
          beginning, a middle, and an end.

The students nod in appreciation at this profundity.

</b>


<b>INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
</b>
McKee scribbles a diagram onto a transparency in an overhead
projector. It's some kind of complicated time-line with act-
breaks and corresponding page numbers indicated. The
audience members take copious notes. Kaufman sweats.

<b>                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
</b>          It is my weakness, my ultimate lack of
          conviction that brings me here with all
          these desperate idiots lapping up
          everything this bag of wind spouts. Easy
          answers. Rules to short-cut yourself to
          success. And here I am, because my jaunt
          into the abyss brought me nothing. Well,
          isn't that the risk one takes for
          attempting something new. I should leave
          here right now. I'll start over --
              (starts to rise)
          I need to face this project head on and --

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          ... and God help you if you use voice-
          over in your work, my friends.

Kaufman stops, looks up, startled.    McKee seems to be looking
at him.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          God fucking help you! It's flaccid,
          sloppy writing. Any idiot can write
          voice-over narration to explain the
          thoughts of a character. You must
          present the internal conflicts of your
          character in image, in symbol. Film is a
          medium of movement and image.

Kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks. "Any
idiot..." writes the guy on one side of him. "Flaccid..."
writes the guy on the other side.

                    MCKEE (cont'd)
          Okay, one hour for lunch.

<b>EXT. NYC STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
Students exit onto the street in small groups. Kaufman
wanders by himself. His face is troubled. There is no sound.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           88.

<b>INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
</b>
McKee lectures. Kaufman sits and listens. A copy of
Aristotle's Poetics sits on his lap. The book features a
bust of Aristotle on the cover.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          You want your writing to be original.
          You want to have an original voice like
          Neil Simon or Nora Ephron. Well, let me
          tell you something, my friends. The key
          to originality is not eccentricity.

A guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative "mmmm."

<b>INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

It's late. The audience is tired, but still attentive. Now
Kaufman takes serious notes. McKee, energetic as ever, wears
his sweater tied around his shoulders. We stay firmly
planted on his face as he talks and talks.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          Long speechs are antithetical to the
          nature of cinema. The Greeks called it
          stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of
          ideas. A long speech in a script, say a
          page long, requires that the camera hold
          on the actor's face for a minute. Look
          at the second hand on your watch as it
          makes one complete rotation around the
          clock face and you'll get an idea of how
          intolerable that would be for an
          audience. The ontology of the screen is
          that it's always now and it's always
          action and it's always vivid. Life is
          rarely vivid. And that's an important
          point. We are not recreating life on the
          screen. Writers are not tape recorders.
          Have you ever eavesdropped on people
          talking in a coffee shop? Then you know
          how dull and tedious real conversation
          is. Real people are not interesting.
          There's not a person in this world -- and
          I include myself in this -- who would be
          interesting enough to take as is and put
          in a movie as a character.

McKee faces the audience, holding a cup of coffee.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          Someone asked me recently, Bob, do you
          think Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty.

He pauses theatrically, sips his coffee, then:

              (deadpan)
          Michelle Pfeiffer is proof, my friends,
          that there's a fucking God.

The overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter.
Kaufman, with dark circles under his eyes, giggles a little.

          Okay. That's it for tonight. Remember,

<b>EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

The last of the students are filing out. Kaufman waits,
leaning against the building. McKee emerges, carrying his
brown leather bag. A shaky, tired Kaufman approaches him.

Laroche and Orlean slog through the water with purpose,

          down the diagonal of the levee, we could
          see the gleam of a fender. We followed
          it like a beacon all the way to the road.

Orlean and Laroche walk toward the car.

<b>INT. BAR - NIGHT
</b>
Kaufman and McKee sit at a table with beers.   Kaufman reads
from his copy of The Orchid Thief.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          ... We followed it like a beacon all the
          way to the road.

Kaufman closes the book.   There's a pause.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          Then what happens?

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          That's the book. I wanted to present it
          simply, without big character arcs or
          sensationalizing the story. I wanted to
          show flowers as God's miracles.   I
          wanted to show that Orlean never saw the
          blooming ghost orchid. It's about
          disappointment.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          I see. That's not a movie.     You must go
          back and put in the drama.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>              (pause)
          I've got pages of false starts and wrong
          approaches. I'm way past my deadline. I
          can't go back.

<b>                    MCKEE
</b>          Ah, the everpresent deadline. Yes, I was
          doing a Kojak once and... it was hell.

McKee sips his beer, eyes Kaufman.

                    MCKEE (cont'd)
          Tell you a secret. The last act makes
          the film. You can have an uninvolving,
          tedious movie, but wow them at the end,
          and you've got a hit. Find an ending.
          Use what you've learned this weekend.
          Give them that and you'll be fine.

Tears form in Kaufman's eyes.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          You promise?

McKee smiles.   Kaufman hugs him.   McKee recognizes his bulk.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A drunken Kaufman paces, tries to read Story. McKee's Ten
Commandments are taped to the wall. As is a photo of
Michelle Pfeiffer ripped from a magazine.

<b>                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)
</b>             Climax. A revolution in values from

             positive with or without irony -- a value
             swing at maximum charge that's absolute
             and irreversible.

Kaufman is lost.       He rubs his temples.   He dials the phone.

Donald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the
script. Kaufman paces. Donald finishes, is quiet.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          So, like, what would you do?

<b>                    DONALD

</b>

<b>                   KAUFMAN
</b>         Uh, it's what happened to Laroche.   It's
         kind of important.

<b>                   DONALD
</b>         It's boring. No offense. A courtroom
         scene should be dramatic. Stick the
         ruling in a line of dialogue, maybe.

<b>                       KAUFMAN
</b>         Um.   Okay.

<b>                   DONALD
</b>         Too much about orchids. Get rid of it.
         Pare that stuff down to a minimum.
         Frankly, I'd focus more on the
         relationship between the brothers. I
         think that's the gold here. No one cares
         about orchids.

<b>                   KAUFMAN
</b>         The book's about orchids.

<b>                   DONALD
</b>         That's a problem. But don't let it ruin
         the movie. I mean, for example, use the
         orchids in a more dramatic way. Have
         some kind of bang-up, crazy action
         sequence in the swamp. Use the swamp
         better. It's a tremendous fictional
         world. A setting of great dramatic
         possibility.

<b>                    KAUFMAN

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          It's sex, man! Incorporate it.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The front door opens and Kaufman enters. The lights are off,
but the room is aglow with light from Donald's laptop
computer. Kaufman sees a silhouetted Donald masturbating in
front of the computer. Donald looks up, caught.

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          Oh, hi, I was doing some research.   I
          found Laroche's site and... I'm
          embarrassed.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          Jesus, Donald.

Kaufman passes Donald, glances at the grainy nude on the
screen. He's stunned. It's Orlean smiling at him.

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          What? She's kinda cute. You don't like
          her? I dunno, I think she's okay. It's
          not like I'm marrying her.

Kaufman shows Donald Orlean's book jacket photo.

                     DONALD (cont'd)
          Oh, wow.   That's kind of a twist, huh?

Donald, dressed like Kaufman, waits by the elevators. Orlean
emerges. He's about to talk to her, when she pulls out a
cell phone and dials. Donald decides to be a spy and follows
her out of the building.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Orlean talks on the phone.       Donald trails close behind her.

<b>                       ORLEAN
</b>             So you'll pick me up?    Yeah, tomorrow.

Orlean stops to look in a shoe store window. Donald stops
and looks in the window also. Orlean doesn't notice him.

                       ORLEAN (cont'd)
             Ten-twenty. TWA. Yes, of course I will.

Donald walks off.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Donald is focused on the computer. Kaufman sits in a chair
in the corner. Both men are in pajamas.

<b>                       KAUFMAN

Kaufman looks squeamish. Donald picks up a hairbrush, holds
it to his mouth. He starts to sing "Happy Together."
Kaufman smiles sheepishly, shrugs Donald off. Donald
persists. Finally Kaufman joins in. They do the whole
number and fall laughing into each other's arms.

<b>EXT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
Orlean waits with a suitcase outside the terminal. The beat-
up white van pulls up. Orlean gets in, the van speeds off.
Another car pulls away from the curb and follows it.

<b>INT. CAR - A BIT LATER

Donald drives, keeping up with the van, which speeds and
swerves through traffic. Kaufman is sweaty, nervous.

<b>                     KAUFMAN
</b>          It's so weird to actually see that van in
          real life.

</b>          So you want to build the symbolic charge

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          Okay, but when you're creating an image
          system, how do you know --

<b>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER
</b>
The van pulls into the driveway of a neat, middle-class
house. Kaufman and Donald drive by, in time to see Orlean
and Laroche emerge from the van. Orlean seems different now:
more exotic. She's wearing some kind of sexy sarong. Donald
drives up the street, parks, gets out of the car, and watches
as Laroche lugs Orlean's suitcase into the house.

<b>                    DONALD

Kaufman gets out of the car. Donald gets in, peruses
Kaufman's script. Kaufman walks past the house, trying to
peer in windows. He sees nothing. He slinks around back.

row upon row of ghost orchids.

<b>                    LAROCHE (O.S.)
</b>          Darlin', I dunno what's come over you!

Kaufman crawls over to the house, lifts his face to the
window. Orlean and Laroche are laughing, kissing, groping,
and undressing each other. Kaufman is heartbroken but
transfixed. Suddenly Laroche locks eyes with Kaufman.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          Don't stop, Johnny.

Laroche jumps up and runs naked to the back door.

Kaufman makes a mad dash around the side of the house.
Laroche cuts him off, grabs him, drags him into the house.

<b>INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Laroche throws Kaufman down into a chair. The chair slides
across the floor, tips over. Orlean seems uninterested. She
kisses Laroche's leg.

<b>                    LAROCHE

Kaufman notices Laroche has a set of beautiful, white teeth.

Laroche shakes Orlean off his leg, kicks Kaufman in the gut.

Kaufman drives. The headlights shine on Laroche's van ahead.
Orlean, no longer stoned, sits next to him, holding a gun.
She skims Kaufman's screenplay.

Orlean laughs derisively.

</b>          You can't learn about passion. You can

<b>EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Laroche leads Orlean through the swamp. He spots something
on a tree, circles it, and stands there, awestruck. Orlean
comes around and sees a beautiful ghost orchid hanging from
the tree.

<b>                       LAROCHE

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          You'll get it.

Laroche pulls a saw from his bag and cuts the branch.

<b>INT. BASEMENT - DAY
</b>
There's a makeshift lab. Laroche is extracting some gooey
substance from the nectary.

<b>                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
</b>          Back in John's basement he explained his
          real plans for the ghost. He'd
          discovered a chemical inside with
          psychoactive properties. His plan had
          always been to clone the flower and make
          a fortune marketing this drug. It was
          Laroche's kind of plan, it wasn't a
          controlled substance because the
          government didn't know it existed.

<b>INT. LAROCHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Orlean nervously snorts some green powder off the coffee
table while Laroche watches. She talks to the camera.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          The first time I tried it, the split
          second it took effect, I understood
          orchids. I loved them with a passion I'd
          never felt for anything. For anyone.

The drug takes effect and Orlean turns away from us, becomes
fixated on the ghost orchid sitting on the table before her.
She smells it, caresses it, cries at its beauty.

<b>INT. RENTAL CAR - BEFORE DAWN

<b>                       ORLEAN

          Now writing is -- words are -- a way to
          remove yourself from passion. So I'm
          done with writing. John and I are making
          a fortune with this extract. It's big in

          "Passion."
              (giggles)
          Isn't that cute?

Up ahead, Laroche turns off the road at the Fakahatchee sign.

                    ORLEAN (cont'd)
          Follow him, please.

<b>EXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER
</b>
Laroche parks. Kaufman parks behind him. Orlean gestures
with her gun for him to get out. As Kaufman comes around the
car, he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat. Laroche
emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over
his shoulder. Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him. Kaufman
shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high
water. They slog through silently. Laroche stops.

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          This spot looks good.
              (thinking aloud)
          Now how do we do this? Hit him in the
          head with a rock first? Keeping in mind
          we can only hit him once and only with as
          much force as would be created by him
          slipping and falling onto the rock.

Laroche paces. Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock.
She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out
of it. Kaufman shivers. Orlean's drugs kick in.

<b>                       ORLEAN
</b>             Holy Jesus. Holy...   Hey, baby, hey...

Orlean trails off.    Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean.

<b>                       LAROCHE
</b>             Should we drown him, then hit him on the
             head? Uh-uh. A body bleeds different if
             the heart's stopped. These new forensic
             guys are very smart. We really have to
             know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor
             mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular
             changes.

          Maybe you think we hit him on the head
          and force water into his lungs after he's
          dead? No, darlin'. They'll know he
          didn't drown. See, contrary to popular
          belief, the lungs do not -- do not --
          fill with water in a drowning. What
          happens is, choking causes an irritation
          of the mucous membranes. This creates a
          shitload of mucus in the windpipe.
          Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a
          sticky foam which may or may not mix with
          vomit. It's the presence of this white
          foam that indicates drowning. There's a
          lot to be aware of, Susie. Shoeprints,
          hair, microscopic fibers. Tire tracks.

Suddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into
the water. Orlean looks up, spaced.    She's confused by a
second Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil.
Donald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road.

Laroche pulls himself from the water.

Kaufman and Donald speed along the swamp road.

<b>                    KAUFMAN

          something while we were in the car?

<b>                    DONALD

Laroche's van pulls close to them and rams them from behind.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          Shit!

It rams them again, this time sending them down into the
swamp. The van stops. Donald tries to back the car onto the
road; the wheels just spin. Laroche steps out of the van.

<b>                    DONALD

Orlean, who is admiring all the plant life.

<b>                    ORLEAN

          Did I say twigs? I meant twins.

Kaufman and Donald run through a colony of sawgrass. It
slices them like razor blades. Kaufman yells in pain. Blood
oozes through their shirts and pants.

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          Cladium jamaicense, guys. Sawgrass. You

          poisonous snakes, fellas. Wild hogs.

Kaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water.
Nowhere to go. Laroche and Orlean close in. The brothers
run along the periphery of the lake. Donald stops.

<b>                     DONALD
</b>          Wait.   Do you hear something?

Kaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          Donald, that sounds bad.

The brothers run in the opposite direction. The galloping
gets louder. It's wild pigs. Donald spots an airboat on the
shore. They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark
for bow to start it.   The pigs get closer. Laroche and
Orlean get closer. Donald finds a button, presses it, the
engine starts. They pull away from the shore just as the
pigs catch up. One pig leaps on board, squealing. Kaufman
kicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat. A kick
connects and the pig flies into the water.

cypress stand.

Suddenly Laroche's van comes tearing around a corner and
speeds along the road at the water's edge. Orlean shoots at
the boat from the van window.

          Hold on!

Donald speeds up. The van keeps up, the shooting continues.
Bullets whiz. Kaufman puts his head in his hands. A bullet
hits the airboat's gas tank. It explodes in a ball of flame,
illuminating the whole swamp. Kaufman and Donald are thrown,
along with flaming pieces of debris. Donald treads water,
looks all around for Kaufman.

                      DONALD (cont'd)
          Charles?!    Charles?! Where are you?

Underwater. A dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings. The
murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the
surface. An alligator appears. Kaufman panics, surfaces.

On the surface, Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water,
then get jerked back down. Donald dives.

Underwater. The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the
leg. Donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken
propeller blade. He hacks the alligator's head off, grabs
Kaufman, and brings him to the surface.

Donald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow.    Another shot is
fired. It skims the water near Kaufman.

<b>                     KAUFMAN
</b>          Fuck!   Fuck, Donald, we're dead.

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          We're okay. How's your leg?

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          I don't know. How's your back.

<b>                       DONALD
</b>          It's fine.     My back is fine.

Laroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting.

Mike Owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck
and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames.

Donald makes it to shore. He climbs out and is helping
Kaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls.

<b>                       KAUFMAN
</b>          Donald!

Kaufman sloshes to shore. His right leg is bloody and
mangled. He lifts his brother's head onto his lap.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          You're gonna be okay.

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          No.  But don't let them get you, too.
              (weak smile)
          You got a fucking awesome third act.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>              (crying)
          Donald, this is an awful, bizarre thing
          to say and an awful time to say it, but
          I'm sorry I didn't get to know you
          better. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          It's really... You've been really nice.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          See, it's just I thought I knew you
          already. I thought you were me. And I
          hated me.

Donald touches Kaufman's face. Kaufman looks at his brother.
Donald's face glows radiantly in the fire light.

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          Well, don't do that anymore.      Okay?

<b>                       KAUFMAN
</b>          Okay.

Donald dies. Kaufman screams heavenward. The van appears
out of the bush, barreling for them. Kaufman rolls his
brother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. The van
follows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt.

Smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights.         Out
of the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns. They
follow Kaufman into the swamp.

Mike Owen pulls next to the disabled van. He gets out,
surveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground.

<b>                    MIKE OWEN
</b>          Jesus, that writer guy.

Owen grabs his C.B., tries to radio for help. It's broken.
He lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off.

Kaufman limps through the dark water.       Laroche and Orlean
follow the sound of his sloshing.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          Water sounds so sparkly. Like lemon
          plastic jewels plopping onto a silver
          trampoline! Dontcha think?

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          Darlin', please.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          Can we fuck now, baby?    Fuck like lemons?

Owen tears along the dirt road. Up ahead, Kaufman limps out
of the swamp, into the truck's headlights. Owen is confused.
He checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and
skids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps
over to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          You gotta help me.    You gotta help me.

<b>                    MIKE OWEN
</b>          What the hell is going on here?

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          They're after me. They've got guns.
          They killed my brother.

<b>                    MIKE OWEN
</b>          Who's got guns? What are you --

Before Owen finishes, his truck is flipped over. Donald's
body flies into the water. There, staring Kaufman and Owen
down, is a giant man-like beast. It's repulsive, covered in
algae-matted fur.

                       MIKE OWEN (cont'd)
          Holy shit.

The two men turn and run.

                       MIKE OWEN (cont'd)
          It's real!     I can't believe it, I never --

The creature grabs Owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick.
Kaufman screams as he runs, watches over his shoulder. He
runs right into the arms of Orlean.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          Hey, it's the screenwriter!

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          There's a thing back there!    You don't
          want to be here.

Kaufman, Orlean, and Laroche look back. Nothing there.

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          You're right, I don't want to be here.
          I'm tired, let's get this over with.

Laroche puts the gun to Kaufman's head. Kaufman tenses.
Orlean studies Laroche's gun. Her nose is practically
touching the barrel.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          I love your gun, baby.    Can we trade?

<b>                    LAROCHE
</b>          Stand back, sweetness.

Laroche reaches for Orlean's arm to pull her away. Suddenly
the creature grabs Laroche, pulls him into the swamp.

                     LAROCHE (cont'd)
          Susie!   Susie!

Orlean looks around.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          Where'd Johnny go?

<b>                       LAROCHE (O.S.)
</b>          Susie!

Orlean, agitated and disoriented, fires repeatedly into the
darkness. Something slumps forward in the water. Orlean
steps cautiously over, keeping her gun on Kaufman. The
creature is dead, so is Laroche.

          Oh, Johnny.

She sits next to Laroche and pets his head.   Kaufman watches
her. The sun is coming up.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          I'd just stare at your picture, and you
          looked so sweet. I read your words and I
          thought you were smart and maybe lost and
          lonely like me. And the way you wrote
          about Laroche. You said he was handsome
          even though he had no front teeth --

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          Oh, Johnny. Johnny's teeth.     Oh...

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          I figured you could look at me and see
          something, even with all my flaws you
          could look at me and find something, you
          could maybe someday write a description
          of me that would be nicer than the one I
          write day in and day out in my head.
              (hopefully)
          Would it be?

Kaufman takes Orlean's chin in his hand and directs her gaze
to him. She stares at him for a long while, then:

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          You're really so wonderful.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          Really?

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          So wonderful. I can see inside your
          soul. It glows with orange sadness.
          It's raining inside you. I want to run
          through your dripply dripples. It's so
          beautiful. I love you. I do.

Kaufman lets go of her face and sits on a rock.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>          It's the drugs.

Orlean stands and walks toward Kaufman.

She paces, unfolds her little square of paper.

                       ORLEAN (cont'd)
          I'm out.     I'm fucking cleaned out.

Kaufman watches her for a moment.

</b>          Okay, bye.

<b>                    ORLEAN
</b>          I can't let you go, fatty.    I can't let
          you make this public.

Kaufman keeps walking.

                    ORLEAN (cont'd)
          You hear me? You pathetic, fat, bald...
          You don't even know how to write! You're
          not even... You're not leaving here!
              (screaming, crying)
          I need a fix! Everything's so ugly!

Orlean screams in anguish. Kaufman keeps walking. Orlean
shakily aims the gun at his back. She shoots. Kaufman
falls, gets up, keeps walking. She aims again through her
tears. Suddenly she's pounced on by a bloody, soaking wet
figure. Kaufman turns.

<b>                       KAUFMAN
</b>          Donald!

Kaufman limps back.    Donald and Orlean roll on the ground.

<b>                    DONALD
</b>          My brother is not fat. He's not bald.
          My brother is a great writer! He was
          trying to do something important!

The gun fires. Orlean slumps over Donald. Kaufman arrives.
Both Donald and Orlean are dead. Kaufman falls to his knees.

<b>EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

The sun is high. Fires smoulder. A tow-truck extricates one
of the crashed vehicles. State police cars, ambulances,
ranger trucks abound. Kaufman is wrapped in a blanket.

          think it might be a Swamp Ape. And
          that's Donald, my twin brother. He saved
          my life.

Kaufman cries a little.    The cop waits sympathetically, then:

<b>                    POLICE OFFICER
</b>          You two really look alike.

<b>                    KAUFMAN
</b>              (proudly)
          Yeah. Yes, we do.

<b>INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY

Kaufman sits in a booth, working longhand on a legal pad.
He's a little scraped-up, a little tougher. A copy of Story
by McKee is among his reference material. Alice, the
waitress, walks by and glances at the table.

<b>                    ALICE

<b>                    ALICE

<b>                    KAUFMAN

</b>             That's tough. Let's see... about being

             that if you can't love yourself, you
             can't really love anyone.

<b>                       ALICE

<b>                       KAUFMAN
</b>             Anyway, it helped put things in

             You. Me. And I want to show people
             that. For my brother. For everyone.

There's a pause.       Alice just stares at him, in awe.

Alice smiles, sits.      The two of them begin to talk.
