</b>"... and as he stared at the sky and listened to a cow
mooing almost dreamily in a distant village, he tried to
understand what it all meant -- the sky, and the fields,
and the humming telegraph pole; he felt that he was just
at the point of understanding it when his head started to
spin and the lucid languor of the moment became
intolerable..."

<b>
</b>In this script there are six main characters who inhabit
different periods of time, from pre-history to the
present day. But there is just one story. Because we
blend into one developing narrative the lives that we
show.

There is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation
or any other tricksy or mystic device. We can do in real
time and with real characters what other movies strive to
do with immortal time travellers and ghosts. Our story
is thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are
dealing with is real, human magic.
In moving from one character to the next everything will
change; supporting characters, setting, period. But the
essential situation of our hero of the moment will relate
to the one before and the one following.
The magic will be in the transitions, in leaving one
character and advancing the film through hundreds or
thousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly
similar human circumstances. The effect of these transi-
tions across space and time, will let the audience grasp
the simple truth behind our story; that we are all in it
together.
The key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human
connection at the heart of the film is that one actor
will play the six individuals. The feeling will be of
the endless, glorious playing and replaying of the simple
drama of being alive.
We end the film with a present-day hero, but by that time
we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh
light, feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave
and the others who have gone before. The resolution of
his contemporary story is theirs also. By then perhaps,
we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec-
tive, too.

And the structure of the film itself has the thrill of
novelty. It has never before been used in cinema.
Never. Our six characters and their stories connect in
many different ways, some obvious, others vague, tanta-
lizing threads. Even global connections are made, as the
planet itself and all its people, come and go in the
story. For the audience the game of making the connec-
tions, feeling the bonds, even inventing or discovering
associations of their own, will be endless in this big-
gest of stories, smallest of stories. It is truly a new
cinematic experience.                                       *

<b>                             BEING HUMAN
</b>      Hector is a family man. He and his woman and two
      children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a
      hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance
      by a covering of branches and brush. Just inside a small
      fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged
      into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever went out it
      would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com-
      fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family.
      Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is
      simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea
      of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not
      yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector
      is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of
      Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In
      his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten
      square miles of it.


<b>      FADE IN:
</b><b>      FIRST IMAGE
</b>      is the reflection of Hector's face in a rock pool. The
      image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself,
      deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his
      image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When
      he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down
      closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and
      fingers a blemish on his cheek.
      Then he is aware of another presence. He sharply turns.
      Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some
      rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out.
<b>                               HECTOR
</b>                 Go back home... leave me alone...

      We see that the figure is a young BOY, Hector's son.     The
      Boy thinks about it for a moment, before turning and
      disappearing behind the rocks.

      The small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to
      cook the day's meal. Beyond the fire on a rock shelf
      HECTOR plays with his children, a GIRL of six and Boy of
      eight. It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge
      in, but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal. Hector
      is acting the part of some trapped wild animal, lashing
      out at the hunters surrounding him. But in his act of
      wild rage he gets carried away. He picks up his son and
      throws him hard, much too hard, on his back.

</b>      The Boy tumbles down   from the shelf to the cave floor at
      his mother, DEIRDRE's   feet, howling in pain. Deidre
      scowls at Hector. If    the gesture had been invented he
      would probably shrug   his shoulders. The Boy howls on.
      Hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics
      as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer. Her whole little
      form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy
      unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime
      noises, squeals and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci-
      nated. Where has his daughter gone? Who is this strange
      wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him?
      Hector's daughter delights him. And while Hector watches
      his daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector.

      It is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has
      diminished. By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making
      love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. It's diffi-
      cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. What
      has 6000 years done to that art? We will think about it.
      On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children.
      As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep.
      Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover.
      We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching,
      learning children.
      Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave.
      The Boy wants to go foraging with him again.

<b>                                 HECTOR
</b>                   No... stay here... stay!
      Hector takes a few steps.    The Boy follows.

<b>                                 HECTOR
</b>                   No... go back... go away...

      Hector walks on again, taking big, angry father strides.
      The Boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance. Hector
      walks on for some time before turning on him.

<b>                                 HECTOR
</b>                   Leave me alone! Stay here...
                   Stay!

      There is real anger in his voice. The Boy wisely
      retreats to the cave. As Hector turns to continue his
      walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from
      the entrance. She holds out her arms ready to comfort
      the Boy rejected by his father. Hector is in the
      classic, timeless, no-win situation and he knows it.
      With a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach.

<b>5   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             5
</b>    Hector is foraging on the shoreline, gathering cockles,
    seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible. He splashes
    in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven
    bag. Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its
    shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed.
    Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle
    age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and
    an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition
    a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly
    drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light
    paperwork propped up on some pillows.

    The sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur-
    veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He
    watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are
    nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He
    smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro-
    vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of
    appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte-
    gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land-
    scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a
    present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist,
    never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world
    being rather empty.
    Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or
    orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows
    simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, rough
    comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety of
    their cave.
    Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh-
    tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some-
    thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a
    smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his
    bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a
    vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and
    gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his
    eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the
    glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the
    edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular
    motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar-
    driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into
    Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the
    beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows
    is fear, blind, gut-turning fear.

<b>6   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          6
</b>
    Hector is a small figure in the landscape now, racing up
    the steep slope in the direction of his home.

</b>    He stops for breath and to look back on the bay. The
    shapes are distinct now, two large open boats, roughly
    made but menacingly adequate for their purpose, coastal
    raiding. The boats are nearing the beach now and figures
    can be seen preparing to land. Hector gathers enough of
    his wits and strength to continue his race up the
    hillside.

<b>7   INT. HECTOR'S CAVE - DAY                                     7
</b>
    Inside, his family are in a state of panic. They seem to
    have prepared for this moment. Through their agitation
    there is purpose. They gather bits and pieces to carry
    with them in their flight. Hector's children are attemp-
    ting to take too much. Hector shouts instructions to
    them as he puts more wood on the fire. It must stay
    burning in their absence.
    Hector gathers his family together and they leave the
    cave.


<b>8   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          8
</b>    Hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope
    further into the hills. His woman runs off the other
    way. A hasty, confused argument takes place.

<b>                                 HECTOR
</b>                 Up the hill!
<b>                               DEIRDRE
</b>                 No, down onto the other beach.
                 The little ones can't take the
                 hill. Neither can I.

<b>                              HECTOR
</b>                 Up the hill! They're down there
                 already. I saw them!

<b>                                 DEIRDRE
</b>                 You're wrong!
    She runs off down the slope. Hector has no choice but to
    follow her, herding the children in front of him.

    Deirdre runs on, heading for the lower slope and the cover
    of some trees. Then from these same trees she sees the
    figures of the RAIDERS coming toward her. She turns,
    running back up the hill. Hector and the children also
    turn and run back the way they have come, by now dropping
    precious bits of food and other possessions. The Raiders
    are running strongly, five or six of them.

</b>     The little Girl starts to go back for a precious toy she
     has dropped. Hector picks her up and carries her off
     over his shoulder. The Boy follows.
     Deirdre is trailing behind them. She was right. She
     doesn't have the stamina for the hill. Hector looks back
     and sees the Raiders gaining on her. His face is a con-
     fusion of fear and indecision. He almost stops, as if to
     go back and help her, but then changes his mind and runs
     off once again with the children. Deirdre is by now
     throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers,
     hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her
     to gain some ground. But they don't stop and the effort
     tires her even more.

     She attempts one final dash and then, all of her energy
     gone, she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers.
     the Raiders break their run also and trot and finally
     walk, the distance between them and Deirdre.
     Hector is watching all of this over his shoulder, still
     running. He stops for a moment to watch Deirdre being
     finally surrounded by the Raiders. Then he runs on.


<b>9    EXT. VALLEY - DAY                                          9
</b>     Hector is tiring, too. With the Girl still awkwardly
     clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep
     slope, half-dragging the Boy up behind him. He stops
     for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the
     valley below. In a moment of utter panic he lets go of
     his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on
     alone. We can sense the moment of release in his
     unburdened flight. But it doesn't last long. Some way
     up the slope he stops and turns. He sees his children,
     only now beginning to work out what has happened, and
     the raiders below. He can't do it. Even as the Girl
     calls to him he is running back down the hill, feeling
     the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him.

<b>                                GIRL
</b>                  Come back, Dada...

<b>10   EXT. VALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                          10
</b>
     Hector and the children have reached the safety of a
     small valley higher up in the hills. The raiders have
     been slowed down by their capture of Deirdre. Hector
     is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of
     a solitary tree on the hillside. He coaxes them up into
     the higher branches.

</b>                  Don't move from here. I'll come
                  for you in the morning. There's
                  no food. Try and sleep in the
                  branches. Don't cry. Don't make
                  a noise.
     Hector moves off, looking back to his children in the
     tree.  They too gaze anxiously at him. They don't wave.
     Maybe waving hasn't been invented yet. Hector heads off
     alone, higher into the hills.


<b>11   EXT. ROCKS - DUSK                                          11
</b>     It is dusk now. We find Hector waking from a fitful
     sleep behind some rocks. He sits up and takes in his
     surroundings. His face hardens as awareness of his pre-
     dicament returns. He stands up and then crouching low,
     moves off down the hill.


<b>12   EXT. VALLEY - DUSK                                         12
</b>     Hector has returned to the area of the tree. He slows
     down some distance away and just in time. He sees a
     figure standing beneath the tree. He moves forward to
     the protection of some rocks, and watches. He is close
     enough to hear the voice of the solitary Raider, although
     he doesn't understand the words. The Raider looks up
     into the branches and talks in a friendly, persuasive
     way.
<b>                                RAIDER
</b>                  It's too cold to spend all night
                  up there. We've got a fire at the
                  beach. Food, too.

     There is no response from the tree.    The Raider coaxes
     again.
<b>                                RAIDER
</b>                  Come on! Your mother's down
                  there. She's happy... she's warm,
                  too... and full... she wants to
                  see you... she sent me...

     His friendly tone of voice has an effect. There is
     movement in the branches. Hector can see the dark shapes
     of his two children clambering down. The Raider
     stretches out his arms and helps the Boy to the ground.

</b>     Then he reaches up for the Girl, catches her as she drops
     and keeps her in his arms. He laughs in a comforting
     way.
<b>                                RAIDER
</b>                  That was easy, eh? You're half
                  asleep already, little girl. I'll
                  carry you.
     Hector watches the Raider and his children move slowly
     off, down the hillside, the Raider carrying the Girl in
     one arm and holding the Boy's hand. They almost look
     like a family.

<b>13   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                        13
</b>
     It is fully dark now. On the beach the Raiders have set
     up a comfortable camp with a large fire. We are still
     with Hector. He has come down from his bleak hiding
     place in the hills. The smell of fire and food and con-
     cern for his family, have drawn him here. He is hiding
     somewhere way off from the camp, but close enough to
     observe it.
     What he sees disturbs him, but for odd reasons. His
     family appear to be happily integrated with the Raiders.
     His two children have become fast friends with the man
     who coaxed them from the tree. His woman is with a
     larger group closer to the fire. They are playfully
     attempting to communicate with her, and although still a
     little timid, she is smiling. There is no hint of bar-         *
     barity, rape or abuse. That was not the intention of the
     Raiders. To them, a fertile woman and two healthy
     children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages.
     For their part, the family have to accept the situation.
     Food and shelter are the best that life can offer.

     Painfully, Hector takes in the reality of the scene. His
     family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. In
     the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the
     headland forever. He watches them for a while longer,
     then it becomes too painful. He retreats into the dark-
     ness and up into the empty hills again.


<b>14   EXT. ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT                                 14
</b>     Hector spends a long, cold night alone, squatting in a
     narrow crevice in the rocks. He doesn't sleep, or even
     attempt to close his eyes. He stares into the darkness.
     There is nothing in the world to comfort him, no phi-
     losophy or religion, no friend to run to. This night he
     is utterly alone.

<b>15   EXT. ROCKS - MORNING                                       15
</b>     In the morning it is lightly raining. Hector stands in
     the drizzle outside the shelter. It seems to revive him,
     refresh him, even comfort him. A sign, however meager,
     that life goes on. Then Hector trots off in the direc-
     tion of the shore. There is not much else that he can
     do.


<b>16   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           16
</b>     The Raiders are loading up their boats, wading back and
     forth from the shoreline. Hector watches from cover.
     His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            *
     whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.         *

     The last of the Raiders on shore wade out the short dis-
     tance to the boats. Hector watches these moments of
     departure, watches the faces of his family.
     Hector makes his move. In a mad act he breaks cover and         *
     runs down toward the departing boats. The last Raiders
     are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the
     water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and
     impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders
     all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing
     Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling.
     Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands
     looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long
     moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their
     twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a          *
     motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in
     the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange
     remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely.
     His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.         *
     The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling
     and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare
     to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat.
     He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of
     Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but
     they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him.
     The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise
     man, although he's still only about thirty years old.
     The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and
     points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods
     his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector
     stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the
     boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him,
     take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise        *
     as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her          *
     own feelings, wisely holds them back.                           *

</b>     Hector's hands have been bound with rope. He is being
     led up to the top of the cliffs. The Priest and the
     Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely.
     At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the
     wide sea are stretched out beneath them. The Priest, as
     they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile of
     large stones at the very summit of the headland. The
     mound of stones is obviously man-made.
<b>                            PRIEST
</b>               I told you! I knew they did it
               around here! Ask him...
     The Leader moves closer to Hector and talks to him in a
     friendly, reasoning tone.

<b>                             LEADER
</b>               What do we do? Do we throw you
               over, is that the idea?
     Hector doesn't understand.    He looks at him blankly.
<b>                             LEADER
</b>               He wants me to throw you over.
               What does it do? Does it help the
               sun? Should I throw you over?
     The Leader tries to help Hector understand by miming the
     act of throwing him off the cliff. Hector doesn't know
     how to respond.
<b>                             PRIEST
</b>               I tell you, it's one man, one
               stone. It'll help the voyage.
     The Leader is unsure. He walks around the pile of
     stones, checking it out from all sides as if it was some
     infernal machine that he didn't know the workings of. He
     squats down and squints through it to the watery sun
     emerging from the clouds far out to sea. He looks across
     to Hector, now sitting on the grass. The Leader sits
     down beside him. They sit together like friends. The
     ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim.

<b>                             LEADER
</b>               What's it got to do with the sun?
<b>                             PRIEST
</b>               I don't know, yet.

     The Leader looks at Hector.    Then he makes up his mind.

                  Just add a stone to the pile. Let
                  him go. That's the best we can
                  do.  Let's go.

     With that, he stands up. The Priest, with some       sense of
     ceremony, looks around for a large stone, picks      one up
     and places it on top of the pile. He waits for       a moment,
     almost as if he expects some consequence of his      action.

<b>                                PRIEST
</b>                  It's meaningless, without him
                  going over the cliff.

     The Leader strides off back toward the beach. The others
     follow him, giving a final look or smile to Hector, apart
     from the Priest, who looks him up and down, regretting
     that he is not by now a corpse in the ocean. Hector
     watches them go, too shocked still to react in any mean-
     ingful way. He stands alone, trying to unpick the rope
     that binds his hands.
     When they are some distance from him, Hector starts to
     follow them, at first running to catch up and then simply
     trotting after them. The Raiders are aware of him behind
     them. The Leader eventually stops and calls to Hector.
<b>                                 LEADER
</b>                  Off you go.   We don't want you.
     He turns from Hector   and moves on. Hector persists in
     following them. They    are his only connection now with
     anything that thinks   or feels in the world. His link
     with them is all that   is left. Again and again the
     Leader stops to shoo   Hector away, but Hector dumbly tags
     along behind.

     The Raiders wade out to the waiting boats. Hector
     follows to the very water's edge, then stands and bleakly
     watches them. The Raiders prepare to move off. Hector
     is an embarrassment to them now. At the last moment the
     Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. The man
     clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again,
     carrying a large flint-bladed knife. He comes out of the
     water and walks up to Hector. Hector is beyond any form
     of reaction. He will take whatever is offered to him.
     The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in
     front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's
     family are tense with fear for his life.

</b>     Then the tense moment passes, as the man grunts and nods
     at Hector's hands, still bound with rope. Hector under-
     stands. He lifts his hands and the man with some effort
     hacks through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades
     back to the boat.

     As the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him. The
     man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to
     Hector on the shore. He offers Hector the cut piece of
     rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. He even smiles.
     Hector refuses the gift. The man stands sheepishly for a
     moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades
     back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a
     family.

     Hector watches them for some time, his family and the
     strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from
     his view and his life.
     At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He
     goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then
     retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge,
     picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks
     off with it. It might be of some use to him.


<b>19   INT. CAVE - DAY                                            19
</b>     Hector has returned to his cave home, now cold and empty
     of life. He is working on his instincts now, still
     emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of
     the fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold
     some life. Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly         *
     and blow at the fire's remains.
     We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the
     simplest act of physical survival. For him the problems
     of emotional survival without his family lie ahead.

<b>20   INT. BATHHOUSE FURNACE - DAY                               20

     This is another, bigger fire. In fact we might be in
     hell. A crude furnace blazes. Filthy, sweat-covered
     men feed it with wood and charcoal, an endless task given
     the ferocity of the fire. To one side of the oppressive,
     low-ceilinged furnace room, some small boys endlessly
     toil at two large bellows, feeding the flames with jets
     of air. OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is
     WHISTLING, an odd human sound in an inhuman setting.
     Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood.
     We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass
     of dangerously crude clay pipes, oozing water and steam
     at every joint.

<b>21   INT. BATHHOUSE - DAY                                      21
</b>     Above the heat and filth there is a different world. A
     clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning
     conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room
     of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have
     advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the
     technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of
     the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and
     comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance,
     some around the edge of the pool, others in the water
     rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three
     or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie-
     torial way that they look after their masters gives the
     place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over-
     indulged grown-ups.

     And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall,
     holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more
     healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so         *
     by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face
     that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached
     from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He
     watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need
     that he might have.

     Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others
     around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older        *
     man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying
     but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius'
     pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older
     man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector         *
     immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as
     Lucinnius climbs out of the water.
<b>                             LUCINNIUS
</b>               I'm going to the cool room.


<b>22   INT. BATHHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                      22   *
</b>     Hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him,
     a look of concern on his face. Lucinnius' worries are
     Hector's also.
     Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various
     chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and
     the massage room as they go. All around them slaves
     attend to their pampered masters.

<b>23   INT. BATHHOUSE - COOL ROOM - DAY                          23   *

     After an anxious scan of the cool room, Lucinnius goes
     towards three men occupying a marble bench.

</b>     Hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for
     his master to sit on as he joins the others. Hector then
     moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's
     behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to
     casually join his friends. The eldest of the three
     gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked
     man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to
     the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con-
     tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal
     hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm
     smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his
     master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave
     and master exist so closely together that many of
     their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's
     feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange.
     From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too,
     Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's.
     Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic
     schizophrenia?
     As Luccinius stands to leave we can    tell by their expres-
     sions that the THREE MEN are open in    their contempt for
     him. Hector is quickly on his feet     and by Lucinnius's
     side as he goes. A final sarcastic     remark comes from one
     of the three.
<b>                                MAN #1

     Lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave.              *

<b>24   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            24

     This is not the grandeur of Rome, but the dusty main
     street of a provincial capital in Greece or Spain or
     North Africa. It is difficult to tell from the people
     because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd, faces from
     every corner of the Mediterranean world. It has some-
     thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western,
     except that here the half-finished buildings are made of
     brick and stone.
     Lucinnius leaves the bathhouse. Hector follows three
     paces behind him, loaded down with the large towel, the
     scrubber, robe, and the wooden stool. The stool goes
     with them everywhere, in case Lucinnius has to stop in
     the street and converse with a friend. Other notables
     are among the street throng, their own slaves tagging
     along behind with their little wooden stools. Some have
     whole trains of slaves shadowing them. Human status
     symbols. Lucinnius stops near some street stalls.
     Hector stops beside him.

     Hector places the stool at Lucinnius's feet and moves off.
     Lucinnius sits down, still absorbed in his problems.

     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius as he orders the food.
<b>                                HECTOR

                  the bread.
     As Hector is given the food and pays for it, he sees
     another man, JULIAN, approach Lucinnius, trailed by TWO
     SLAVES. One of them is carrying a folding chair much
     more substantial than Lucinnius's. Julian and Lucinnius
     greet one another and sit down to talk, Lucinnius at
     something of a height disadvantage. The Two Slaves move
     off to one side. Lucinnius's mood has brightened since
     the arrival of his friend. Their conversation seems open
     and friendly.
     Hector gives his master his food, and then moves to join
     the Two Slaves, hearing a snatch of the conversation as
     he goes.

<b>                                JULIAN

     about their masters.

     Lucinnius and his friend stand and exchange their final
     words, unaware of the scrutiny they have been under, or
     so used to it that they are oblivious to it. Hector
     and the Slaves hurry to gather up the seats and take their          *
     positions behind their masters. The casualness of their
     conversation has gone, and they resume the formality of
     their roles.

     concocts appropriate responses.
     He has a tough occupation, being the alter ego to an
     ambitious loser in one of the most competitive and
     dangerous societies ever to exist. And he has to carry

     HERMAS. They are gathered around a shrine in the large
     public room. The entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of

     of the mysteries of his craft, as if it were a skill
     beyond ordinary men.

     Hector looks a Lucinnius, who nods reluctantly. Hector
     opens his purse and counts out the coins for Hermas.

     Hector smiles ruefully.

</b>               It sounds good.
     Lucinnius misses the irony in Hector's voice and enthuses
     about his own future generosity.

</b>               It does, doesn't it!

     rub his shoulders.

               sometime. It's the only chance

     This burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius.   His tense
     muscles yield more to Hector's fingers.
     THALIA enters the room. She is a household slave, a
     Nubian from Africa. She carries a lighted torch and
     moves around the room lighting the wall lamps. Lucinnius
     watches her.

     Late at night, Hector is still awake. He rises from his
     bed and quietly moves out of the room. He is careful
     not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him,
     some of them sprawled on the floor. He shares his bed-
     room with at least eight other slaves. Privacy is a
     master's privilege.

</b>     In the darkened house, Hector makes his way up some
     stairs and along a passage. The only sound is a crack
     or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage,
     Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall.
     He climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his
     head.

     source of light as Hector moves across the flat roof.
     In one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline
     of a figure resting against the low parapet wall. He
     moves towards it. The figure speaks.

     strange, their physical intimacy alongside their matter-
     of-fact conversation, but gradually we understand it, the
     giving and taking of comfort where it can be found, and
     the realness of their friendship. Their stroking and
     touching and holding becomes good to watch. We get a

     hours and half hours, up here on the roof, the only place

     Hector is back in his bed. A figure enters the room,
     steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes
     him awake. Hector comes to. Lucinnius stands over him,
     whispering.

<b>                                LUCINNIUS
</b>                  I can't sleep. Get me a chicken.
                  I want to make another sacrifice.
                  We'll do it ourselves.

     Hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows
     Lucinnius out of the room.

</b>     Hector is in the henhouse, in the dark, selecting a
     chicken for sacrifice. He is about to leave when he
     sees a MAN and WOMAN, arms around each other, sitting in
     a corner. The Man looks at the white hen Hector is
     holding.

</b>               Can't you find a woman, Hector...
     Hector smiles. He isn't surprised to see them. They are
     only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof. The Slaves
     have their meeting places scattered all over the house.
<b>                             HECTOR
</b>               Sorry to trouble you... just

               ... the roof's free...
     The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the
     sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms.
<b>                             HECTOR
</b>               Come on, miss, you can tell
               Lucinnius his future.


<b>33   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                       33
</b>     Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian.
     Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master,
     and he carries a large satchel of documents. Cyprian's
     home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but
     there is already activity around the house, visitors
     coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor-
     tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves.
     Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door
     and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of
     quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as
     if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial
     Mr. Big.


<b>34   EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING                                    34
</b>     The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping
     and playing games of chance on the ground. Their masters
     wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on
     benches along the wall. Cyprian's aides usher the
     visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have
     an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds.

     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching
     her child from a distance on its first day at school.

</b>     Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a
     little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed, hands
     on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri-
     ficial offering himself.
     Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves
     as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by
     place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector
     to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is
     finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits.
     The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge
     within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him
     the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a
     game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door.
     One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go
     into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian.

     Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad
     smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball
     game to join him.
<b>                                HECTOR
</b>                  You look happier.

<b>                                LUCINNIUS
</b>                  Relieved anyway... relieved that
                  it's over at last.
     Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector
     following after him.

<b>35   EXT. STREETS - DAY                                             35
</b>
     Lucinnius and Hector are walking home in their usual
     formation. Hector is closer than normal, so that they
     can talk.

<b>                                HECTOR
</b>                  Will he help you?

<b>                                LUCINNIUS
</b>                  I have to kill myself by tomorrow
                  morning. He has all my letters to
                  Titinius, none of them got
                  through. He says it's like
                  treason... and he says I should
                  want to die for owing him half a
                  million anyway...

     Hector is shocked.

</b>                  Tonight... peace at last...
     Lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock.

     Hector is in   the inner courtyard of the house, beside the
     kitchen. He    is talking to GALLUS, who is Lucinnius's
     ten-year-old   son. Hector has a close friendship with
     him. As we    listen to their conversation it becomes clear
     that Hector   finds comfort in the boy, for the family that
     he lost.
     Today there is an air of distraction about Hector.
     Understandable, considering his scheduled death.
     The kitchen slaves come and go as they talk.

     He scatters some grain on the table.     The chicken at once
     begins to peck them up.

</b>     A dead chicken adorns Lucinnius's table. He and his
     wife, DALMIA, and their son are lying on their couches
     picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius is
     drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other
     household slaves are in attendance. Thalia is also
     there, serving her mistress.
     Dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what.
     She attempts to break the silence. She calls on the cook
     from the kitchen.

     He looks again at Lucinnius and Hector. They look at
     each other. Thalia looks at Hector. Dalmia looks at
     them all looking at each other, more intrigued than she
     was before.

     A SLAVE interrupts them.

     Lucinnius and Hector look at each other and share a
     moment of hope. They might be coming with good news,
     perhaps a softening of Cyprian's heart.

</b>     The two VISITORS that await Lucinnius and Hector are an
     unpromising sight. They are big men, unsophisticated and
     look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas. A couple of
     the godfather's foot soldiers.
     They greet Lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that
     they would break his back at the whim of their master.

     Hector is closing the door when one of the Visitors talks
     roughly to him.

</b>     Late at night in Lucinnius's study, an oil     lamp and a
     candle cast their shadowy light, adding to     the tension in
     the room. Hector stands beside Lucinnius,      who is
     counting out coins and other valuables on     his table.

               three farms and forty thousand...

     Lucinnius places the money in a box on his table. He is
     quite drunk, resigned now to his fate. Hector however is
     cold sober, grim-faced. Lucinnius looks up at him.

     Lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile. He              *
     clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony
     into his voice.

     Lucinnius looks at him for a moment, then reaches out for
     his paper and pen.
<b>                               LUCINNIUS

     He scratches out a few words on the paper, Hector looking
     over his shoulder, keenly watching what he writes.
     Lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen.

     Lucinnius stands and leaves the room.     Hector follows
     with the oil lamp.

</b>     The house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the
     passage and down the stairs to the washing room. Hector
     walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius's crumpled,
     defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first
     quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. Hector
     looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping,
     that Lucinnius's moans will wake the household.

     makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. Hector sees all
     of this from behind as he enters the room. Lucinnius
     crumples to the floor and squats on his knees. He calls
     out in pain.

     Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool,
     holding his stomach. Hector sits down beside him. They

<b>                                LUCINNIUS
</b>                  This is hopeless.

     They sit absurdly like this for a long moment, neither
     of them knowing what do do next. It's awkward, like in a
     waiting room. Then Lucinnius speaks.
<b>                                LUCINNIUS

     Lucinnius' clothing. He raises his head.

     Lucinnius' voice is fading now. Hector waits, then
     reaches down for the knife in Lucinnius' stomach. We
     see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we
     detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius
     on his way? Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little. It's
     as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released
     from the wound. His voice is even more faint.

     him.

     The whispers fade to a croak. Lucinnius lies still.
     Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands    up,
     suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly    he
     gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws     the
     knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor.
     Hector has run out of the room before it has come to    rest
     against the wall.

     bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on
     Lucinnius's cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns
     quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the

     down on the chair, pulls off his worn shoes and places on
     his feet a pair of Lucinnius's stout street sandals.

     Hector is walking quickly from the kitchen across the
     courtyard to the street gate. Near the gate he stops
     and looks back at the house. He makes a decision and
     retraces his steps across the courtyard and back into
     the house.

     Thalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor
     with two other women. Hector gently shakes her shoulder,
     trying not to wake the others. After a moment or two
     Thalia opens her eyes.

     Nearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading
     and preparing ships for the morning tide. By the light
     of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard, voices shout,
     WINCHES CREAK. Hector encounters a night WATCHMAN, but
     diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him.
<b>                                HECTOR

     With an authoritative nod, Hector strides off in the
     direction of the noise and lights, Thalia at his heels.
     Hector talks when the Watchman is out of earshot.

</b>     Hector and Thalia are asleep, huddled together in a cor-
     ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters.

     A CREWMAN comes and shakes Hector awake. He stirs himself
     to the sounds of a SHIP UNDERWAY, the sounds of the SEA-
     WASH, the WIND in the CANVAS, the MOANS of the TIMBERS.

<b>                                CREWMAN

</b>     There is no sign of land behind them. The ship is moving
     swiftly in a strong, clean breeze and a light sea. We
     can tell from Thalia's reactions that she has never been
     out at sea before, at least never above deck. Every-
     thing is novel to her and it shows, even the movement of         *
     the ship. Her excitement is childlike.

<b>                             THALIA

<b>                                                                      *
</b>     Hector, too, is taken by the novelty of it all but is
     less prepared to admit it. He waves his hands around the
     empty horizon noncommittally.
<b>                             THALIA
</b>               Have you been on a ship before?

<b>                             HECTOR
</b>               Yes, of course.

</b>               Me, too, but they kept us down
               there.
     She points down into the lower depths of the hold.   Then
     she gets even more excited.

<b>                             THALIA
</b>               Tonight... we'll be where the
               thunder is!
     They look at each other and then all around them. The
     freshness of the day and on an overwhelming feeling of
     freedom, exhilarate them. Their senses and their
     feelings, are in new territory. They are like children
     in a brand-new world.
     The Captain on the other side of the ship, beckons them.         *

     heading for the port they have left. There is a thrill           *
     in their glamor, their fine progress under full sail.

     and Hector are sitting on deck, some distance from one
     another. They are quieter now, more thoughtful. Hector               *
     catches her eye. Hector is drawn by her smile and moves              *
     to join her. They sit quietly, absorbed in thought,
     thoughts of each other, their looks and smiles tell us
     that. As if they are talking without words. Hector
     looks around him. A sailor on the forward deck is
     sorting out some rope, an echo of a previous time and                *
     place. The wind catches the sailor's hat. He grabs it
     from the air and spends time arranging it once more on
     his head, just so. A tiny human moment.                              *

</b>     A man is driving a heavy two-horse wagon. The wind has
     just lifted his hat from his head. He spends some time
     replacing it carefully, just so. Watching him from the
     back of the wagon is Hector.
     The drama of the lives of Thalia and Hector      has played
     itself out long ago. Between the breath of       sea breeze
     that lifted the hat of the Roman sailor and      the gust of
     mountain wind that snatches the hat of the      wagoner, lies
     1400 years.                                                          *

     Hector sits   in the wagon beside a woman. There are
     tantalizing   similarities between their situation and the           *
     one we left   Thalia and Hector in on the boat a few
     moments ago,   1400 years ago.

     delicate signals of mutual awareness. Talking without
     words.
     They are not alone in the wagon, perched on its half load
     of timber. With them is a NUN accompanying a GIRL of
     about eight. The Girl is tearful. A man, his face
     unseen, is snoring underneath his hat. A younger man,
     gaunt and hungry-looking, is dressed in the rough
     travelling clothes of a monk or PRIEST. Even without his
     habit we would know he was a holy man. His incessant
     talk tells us.

     There is an Irish lilt to his voice which colors what                *
     he is saying with a tinge of mischief. He is a difficult
     fellow to pin down. Hector looks at him amusedly, still              *

     Hector gestures to Beatrice that he is leaving the wagon
     to walk for a while and asks her to join him. She shakes
     her head with a smile. Hector smiles, too, then jumps
     down from the wagon and, walking slowly, allows it to
     gain ground in front of him. The ramblings of the Priest
     fade away.

                  Eve was already tempting her
                  master and mate, and within nine
                  hours the Lord had to expel the
                  both of them! Just think, they                    *

</b>     Hector smiles as the Priest's VOICE FADES into the dis-
     tance. It is a  cold fresh day of early summer. They are       *
     travelling high in the mountains. Hector dawdles on
     his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket.
     The last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed
     WAILING OF the GIRL. Hector lays himself down at the           *
     side of the road. His eyes begin to close. Then a SOUND
     in the distance makes him open them again. He listens.
     MORE SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley.
     He stands up and crosses the track. At first he can see
     nothing. He walks back along the rim of the road. Then
     he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted
     skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge
     crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley.
     There are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with
     twice as many foot soldiers and squires. Even from such
     a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is
     ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this
     distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence
     is real. The scene places Hector in his time and for us
     there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if Hector
     has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to
     some distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is
     where he belongs, in Medieval Europe.
     Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him         *
     he runs off in the direction of the wagon. Like any wise
     citizen of a violent age, Hector knows when to leg it.

     it, happily back in the security of his fellow                 *

     and allows his foot to touch hers. She doesn't move
     away. Hector calls to the Driver.

     their incomprehensible statements, just for the fun of

     with determination.

     to help her, and anyway, is more interested in Beatrice.            *

     The Farmer and his Wife have laid out a table with
     simple food, a stew, bread and wine. The travellers settle
     down to eat. The Priest, however makes a performance out
     of his more modest needs. He calls loudly to the wife
     working at the open fire.

     She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving
     thanks to God for his simple meal, muttering his grace
     quietly to himself, excluding all others from his conver-
     sation with the Almighty.

</b>     In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an
     upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a
     blanket of soft sound over the human forms.

     One of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector,
     in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes
     aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and
     picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure
     pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the
     distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to
     toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and
     moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs.
     Hector rouses himself and follows the other.

</b>     Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. The                 *
     figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING
     there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the
     Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth
     as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under
     his arm. He emerges from the pantry. He sees Hector
     standing by the table. They recognize one another and
     relax. The Priest doesn't re-enter his holy act. He
     speaks normally, cheekily.

<b>                                PRIEST

     holy act.

</b>                  But, Hector, you must keep out

     stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely.

     happier now that he is in control again.

     Suddenly the door is thrown open and four SOLDIERS man-
     handle an inert body, dressed in full armor, into the
     room. They scatter the food from the table and lay out
     the MOANING suit of armor on it. A young SQUIRE follows
     them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. The MOANS
     are MUFFLED because the knight's helmet has been battered
     out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. The
     ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the
     head inside. The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the
     helmet. Their efforts are useless. Blood oozes from the
     joints of the helmet. The MOANING suit of armor seems

                  away.
     The Officer looks at the moaning suit of armor, then at
     the astonished group of Travellers. He picks on the
     Priest.
<b>                                OFFICER

                  heaven yet... there's a hundred
                  thousand livres on his head if I
                  get him to Paris alive... Start                         *
                  praying... there's fifteen livres
                  in it for you if he lives...

     The Priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to
     pray earnestly. The Officer turns to the Soldiers.

     The Soldiers scatter to   carry out their orders. Hector            *
     takes time to watch the   Squire still kneeling beside his          *
     father, quietly stroking   the helmet. Ronald the Priest
     mutters every prayer he   can remember. The suit of armor
     twitches and MOANS.

     Hector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow
     him outside. The Priest looks on helplessly as they
     slide past the table and head for the door.

</b>     More soldiers have continued to make their way to the
     shelter of the farm. Everywhere is the chaos of war.
     Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the
     medicos or the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups.
     Everyone looks for food. Individual soldiers, like lost
     souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their
     comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir-
     teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in
     expensive armor.

     Hector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they
     can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers,
     reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are
     much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci-
     plined unit.
     Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground
     drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they
     perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same
     pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting
     their pikes in unison. They become like one evil,
     inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                *
     more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector
     and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not
     sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they
     soon employ this as another titillating element in their
     love-play.

     Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. The knight
     is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or
     moaning. The suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid
     as we look at it. There is no sense of it containing

     shoulders. Hector begins to probe her hair and scalp.            *

</b>     The Nun's mule turns out of the farmyard and heads off
     along the track. A few Soldiers are burying some of
     their dead nearby. The Nun watches this and doesn't see
     what the Girl sees on the other side, the mingled bodies
     of Hector and Beatrice, all pretence at grooming now
     gone, engaged in fervent lovemaking. It's probably the
     first and last that the Girl will see. A smile flickers
     across her face before she turns away forever. Ahead of
     her there might be many a bleak night in her convent
     when she will remember the image, and that same smile
     will return to her lips.

     The Priest is kneeling beside a young wounded Soldier.
     He is close to death, but in his youth is fighting it.
     He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.

</b>     The Priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness. He
     yawns, a long, contented yawn. He has completed the
     hardest day's work that he has undertaken as a priest,
     if he really is a priest. If he is not, then the pre-
     tence has been just as exhausting. He wants to sleep.


<b>68   INT. FARMHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                     68
</b>     In the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the
     darkness. Some officers have moved in and the place is
     more crowded than before. The Priest makes his way to
     his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She
     snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long
     sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration.

     He steps over her and settles into his own space by the
     window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He
     looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the
     Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging
     her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of
     sleep.
     The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know
     why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of
     Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose
     detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his           *
     cloak over his head.

     Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering
     beside Beatrice. They make love quietly in the dark,
     also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest.

</b>     The Priest wakes up. Outside he can hear the first
     sounds of the day, the murmuring VOICES of Soldiers in
     the yard, the CLATTER OF MILK PAILS. In the room it is
     still semi-dark. The Priest sits up. The others have
     already left, but Beatrice is there, stretching herself
     and fixing her hair. Hector is not with her. She smiles
     at the Priest. Then, in another part of the room, Hector
     emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing, sits up
     and smiles too.

     Hector and Beatrice look at each other. The Priest looks
     at them in turn. Their cheeky act of innocence mocks
     him.

</b>     Hector is washing himself by the stream that flows close
     by the yard. He drinks a handful of water for breakfast.
     The Priest sees him from the farmyard and comes to join
     him.                                                                *
     Hector is in a cheerful mood, pleased with himself and
     his success with Beatrice. The Priest is sullen,
     reproachful.

     The Priest is silent. They are saved from hurting each
     other more. A Soldier shouts down to them from the farm.

     what might be an attempt at an apology or simply another            *
     taunt.

</b>     Hector and Beatrice have packed their few belongings into
     a shoulder bag. They turn out of the farmyard and walk
     down the main track.
     Hector catches a last glimpse of the Priest being helped
     onto the back of a horse, behind a Soldier. He is ridden
     off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop.
     Other battles lie ahead to be blessed, and more battered
     bodies requiring comfort.
     Hector and   Beatrice are enjoying the first pulse-
     quickening   flush of their intimacy, and the thrill of
     knowing it   will go further. They chatter freely,                  *
     despite not   sharing a language.

     sun is shining as they step out onto the higher hills.

     the fold of a hillside, with a wide stream running some
     way below. Hector feeds Beatrice a piece of cheese from
     his knife.

     Hector seems to know what she is saying. He throws down
     his knife and cheese, lying down with her on the grass.
     He kisses her breasts and her body eagerly. He lifts her
     skirts and caresses and kisses her naked legs and thighs.
     She stretches herself out happily, arms spread wide on
     the grass. Hector talks through his kisses.

     Hector doesn't understand, and keeps on with his kissing.
     Only her persistent giggling makes him stop and look up.           *
     Hector sees him too. Down by the stream a head peering
     over the top of a rock, not even attempting to hide.

     There is an uneasy silence while Hector works it out.

     It is the body of a young squire, handsomely dressed
     in the livery of his master. Such a squire would follow
     his knight into battle, guiding him through the chaos.                *
     But this boy seems to have died a less public, more
     furtive death. He lies leaning against a rock, eyes
     open, an expression something like a smile on his face.
     There is no sign of a wound.
     Hector looks around at the ground.

                  Look at his shoes.
     There is a sadness about this young death in such a
     lonely place. Hector and Beatrice are open to this sad-               *
     ness, but in their age sentiment was of a tougher strain.

     the boy's side. Beatrice brings her armful of stones and
     starts to build a mound around the squire's head.

     Hector is watching Beatrice conduct some kind of
     ceremony over the corpse of the squire. She takes a
     handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her
     bag. Mumbling strangely and quickly to herself, she
     walks around the corpse three times, scattering the
     leaves over the body.
     Hector is fascinated, but a little uneasy. He watches
     from a safe distance. During the few moments that it
     takes, Beatrice seems like a different person.
     Then, all of a sudden, the familiar, friendly Beatrice
     returns. She completes her ceremony by throwing a few
     drops of her perfume over the body. She smiles.                    *

     or villages. There might be    the glimpse of a castle on

     is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story book, or
     an ancient landscape on a gallery wall. Once again in
     the film there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not
     from a dream, but in a dream.

     The moment passes in the more down to earth concerns of
     Hector and Beatrice.

     She manipulates the udders of the cow deftly, sexily.
     Her hands seem to have sensual personalities all of
     their own. She is chattering non-stop, explaining the            *

     someone sleep and dream.

     He handles some of the things spilling from her bag,
     lying beside him. Her dried flowers and herbs, which he
     sniffs, her little bottles and phials. Witches brew? Or
     simply an early version of a cluttered handbag?

     We don't know what is passing through Hector's mind.
     Perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying
     with the strange, wonderful, unknowable creature by his
     side. And how many people have done that through the
     ages, in caves or by campfires, or in suburban bedrooms?
     There are many ways in which we will be able to connect
     with this perplexed, flea-ridden man, far away from home,
     huddling by a fire in the forest, trapped in his time, as
     we all are.

     their way down into the thickening forest. Beatrice
     walks ahead, light-footed and humming to herself. She
     seems to be in comfortably familiar territory now. The
     mist swirls about him as Hector follows on behind,
     tagging along as if caught in her sexual wake.

     slow-moving. Beatrice has hailed a boatman from the far

     clamber aboard. Beatrice and the boatman greet each
     other familiarly. They gossip amiably as the ferry makes
     its way across the river. Hector sits quietly with a
     smile on his face, their chatter incomprehensible to him.

     They have reached the outskirts of a village. Beatrice
     turns off the main track and up a narrow path. Hector
     follows her. Soon she stops at a small house close to
     an orchard. The house sits in the mess of a run-down
     farm yard, chickens and goats running here and there.

     Beatrice opens the door of the house and goes inside.
     Hector hesitates before following her.

     understands fully what she means     now, but his mind is
     a confusion. He can't respond.       She tries to direct his

     her time. The scented air and the dizzy SOUNDS OF the
     BEES almost make Hector swoon. He is experiencing the
     full, heady impact of Beatrice, and it is summed up in
     a full-blown pollen-filled sneeze.
     He drinks at   her well. The Boy is beside him, still
     engrossed in   his new shoes. Hector splashes some water
     on his face   and looks back at the house. He has some
     decisions to   make.

</b>     The Mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to
     a comfortable chair that the house has to offer. She
     is working on some lace. Hector enters the room to
     watch her. He smiles and stands shyly at the door. The
     Mother thinks he wants her chair for himself. In a
     flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and motions
     for Hector to have the good seat. He is full of
     embarrassment.
<b>                                HECTOR

                  to watch... please... sit...
     He guides the Mother back to the good chair. They
     struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows
     Hector to settle her there. She mumbles unhappily.

</b>     Hector has retreated to the yard. The Girl is
     boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire. The
     Boy is working at a basketful of flower heads, pulling
     petals and separating the hearts, putting them in a
     large jar of colored liquid.
     Hector is aware of Beatrice watching him. She is
     returning to the kitchen, firmly holding a struggling
     chicken, wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere.
     This chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in
     Beatrice's final effort at total seduction, a wonderful
     meal. Hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes
     meet briefly.
     Hector takes in   what the Boy is doing and joins in
     the work. The    Boy smiles at Hector's initial clumsiness.
     He motions for   Hector to have a sniff of the jar of
     liquid. Hector    does so.  The smell is heady and pleasant.

     Hector sits at the table with Beatrice and her family.
     There is an air of awkward silence, although the Boy
     and Girl look openly at Hector, perhaps assessing him as
     a future father.
     The meal has been served in a communal pot. In Beatrice's
     house there is the luxury of small individual plates.
     The others wait for Hector to begin, but he indicates
     to the old Mother to help herself first. She does, and
     she doesn't stop until her plate is heaped high with
     food. There is definitely some power play going on in
     the old woman's mind, although her face is all innocence.
     Hector submits, taking only a modest portion of food.
     The old Mother's appetite is prodigious. It is comical
     to watch her little frame consume so much, quietly
     and methodically. She is an eating machine.
     During the meal Beatrice and Hector exchange glances. But
     this time their talking without words is a serious affair.
<b>                                HECTOR

     From the kitchen Beatrice watches Hector in the garden.
     he is making an effort to appear relaxed, but as he
     paces here and there Beatrice knows that he is unhappy.
     She leaves the kitchen to join him.

     Hector fumbles awkwardly with his bag and then walks
     off down the track. He turns to look at Beatrice.
     She stands outside her house for a long time, watching
     him until he turns onto the main road and OUT OF SIGHT.
     The pain and the awkwardness in   Beatrice and Hector
     are specific, but the scene of   parting is timeless.
     Is this the ten millionth such   parting, or the billionth?
     It is one of them at any rate,   and a sad one.

     raft, made of ship's timbers. We have left our previous
     Hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago. This
     Hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare.
     The huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together.
     There are over a hundred and fifty people perched on
     them, lying or squatting in sleep. It is early morning.
     The sea is calm around them, but the deep ocean swell is
     still there to remind them of their predicament, menacing,
     like a controlled anger.

     Hector is fully awake now, sitting against some boxes.
     He speaks to ANDRE sitting close by.

     a domestic squabble. We can hear some of their exchanges.

     There is a flurry of movement amongst the figures, then
     a splash, then a cry of a Woman. The noise has awakened
     others. All over the raft figures are coming awake,
     sitting up, taking in the new day, and the dreadful
     reality of their situation.
     Andre speaks to Hector.

     Hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft,
     closer to him. He watches a man and woman. The woman,
     URSULA, still has her eyes closed, sleeping on a pile of
     canvas. The man, FRANCISCO, stands beside her holding
     a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray. His eye
     catches Hector's, and they hold each other's gaze for a

     The sun is up, and Dom Paulo was right. The raft is
     now standing off-shore riding out the heavy ocean surf
     before finally beaching. The strong are helping to row
     ashore, under the shouted instructions of the NAVIGATOR.
     Those too weak to help are huddled beside their posses-
     sions, hoping to survive this final trial of the sea.

     a glance at Ursula and Francisco. Francisco in his
     manic-heroic way manages to row while at the same time
     trying to offer a steadying arm to Ursula.
     If Hector had time or energy to laugh, he would.

     The raft is in the full rage of the surf. The sense
     behind its loose construction is obvious now. Snake-like
     it rides the waves, one half up, the other down. The
     beaching isn't easy. A few people are washed overboard
     with no way of saving them. Finally the raft makes it
     through the barrier of the outer surf. They are in a
     long curving bay. Up from the beach lies an area of             *
     dunes, and beyond that a thick belt of jungle.

     The raft scrapes onto the sand. Those near the beach
     scramble ashore, immediately prostrating themselves in
     prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into
     the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to safety.
     Hector's attention is never far from Ursula. She is             *
     struggling in the water with some of her baggage. A
     youth, NUNO, goes to help her. Hector overtakes him and
     nudges him out of the way, offering to take Ursula's load
     from her shoulders. She refuses his help. Waist-deep in         *
     water they tussle over her bundle of possessions. Hector        *
     overpowers her, wrestles her load from her grasp, angrily
     wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand. In amongst
     the drama of their situation their little battle of wills
     seems petty and pathetic, but it reveals much about their
     past.

</b>     Soon the survivors are dragging their possessions from
     the raft. They have managed to hoard a surprising amount
     from their doomed ship. Carpets, chests, chairs, all
     are dragged ashore.

     Civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner
     of Africa. Dom Paulo, the leader, already has a table
     and chair set up in the sand, and behind him SAILORS are
     erectig a tent-like house, made from timbers and rich
     tapestries and carpets. The others are making their own
     shelters all along the beach. A regular little community
     is taking shape, a crazy, rich-textured village decked out
     in all the colors of the East. The silks and ginghams
     that were destined for the finest halls in Europe now give
     shelter to sick slaves, starving sailors, ruined traders
     and grieving mothers.

     the trauma of near death to   mark out the boundaries of
     their new beach homes with   lines of stones. The habits
     of ownership die hardest of   all.
     Although Dom Paulo is the man in authority he is also a
     man in deep shock. Most of what he has earned or
     plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom
     of the ocean. Since he is socially superior to anyone
     else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command.
     There are probably fifty men among the survivors more
     suited to lead them to safety.
     By Dom Paulo's side always is his SON. A quiet boy of
     about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his
     father, dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a
     constant, silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo does,
     good or bad, wise or foolish. He and his father are a
     continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy
     Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the
     absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high-
     lighted in this way. There can be sadness in it too
     however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's
     compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo's
     sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his
     son's eyes.
     Amidst the construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with
     some of his OFFICERS.

</b>                  Eighty men. Ten women. Eighteen
                  children and forty-five slaves.

<b>                                DOM PAULO
</b>                  Two parties of ten men each... one

                  fruit, anything... and send someone
                  back as soon as you find fresh
                  water. Any trouble, discharge
                  three shots.

     The Officer leaves to carry out his orders.    Dom Paulo
     addresses another of his men, Da Cunha.

</b>     Hector and Andre are walking through the half-built
     village.  Andre is carrying Hector's possessions, a
     rolled-up carpet and a bolt of colorful cloth. We feel
     an echo of the days when Hector was a slave, walking
     two paces behind with his master's possessions.
     Hector finds what he is looking for. Francisco is
     working on a shelter for himself and Ursula, with the
     help of some slaves. Hector approaches him, making
     another attempt to heal wounds from his past.

     distracts them. They see some figures, laden       with
     supplies, running off into the forest. Others       are
     following them, discharging MUSKETS, shouting      for the
     DESERTERS to stop. Hector and Francisco walk       briskly

     are not for killing. But the force of the majority
     weighs on him. He starts to raise his hand. At that
     moment, as he scans the crowd, he meets the eyes of the
     Deserter whose death they are voting on. For a moment
     they communicate. Hector is thrown. He drops his hand,
     only to find in the next instant the stern gaze of
     Salgado on him. He hesitates again, then starts to
     raise his hand. Then the eyes of the Deserter find him
     once more. This comic pantomime goes on while a solid
     majority of the crowd firmly raise their hands.

     Nuno is looking down the beach to the remains of the
     raft on the shoreline. The shapes of the two Deserters
     chained there can just be seen.

<b>100   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                         100
</b>      In the privacy of their tent Dom Paulo and his son are
      engaged in their nightly ritual, practicing on their
      recorders. Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an
      intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is
      an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are
      to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of
      circumstances. But there is also a feeling of madness
      about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of
      what is going on about him. Down on the beach men are
      waiting to die in the morning on his orders. The blend
      of formality and madness make the scene comic.

<b>101   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                          101
</b>
      The sun has risen sharply, soaring out of the ocean. It
      blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party
      making their way along the beach.
      The cross-cum-scaffold has been erected some way from the
      camp. Most people are  attending to their morning
      chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being
      carried out along the shore.

      Our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the
      camp; marionette figures, men dancing on ropes, the form-
      ality of legal death. The priest and the executioners.
      It takes a while for the people in the camp to become
      aware of the other observers up on the dunes. Three
      figures stand in full view, boldly, silently, watching
      the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold.
      The word passes around the camp. Eyes pass between the
      executions and the tall natives watching.   The first man
      is already dangling on the rope by the time that Dom Paulo
      and his officers are discussing the appearance of the
      natives.

                 slaves... we must try and talk to
                 them... If they think we're timid
                 we're dead.

</b>      A solitary SLAVE makes his way up from the camp to the
      natives on the dunes. Everyone in the camp watches as he
      approaches them. There is tension. Will the natives run
      or fight or talk. They begin to talk. The natives seem
      most interested in the hangings, and point in that
      direction, asking questions. The Slave makes an attempt
      at explaining what is happening, but the natives seem
      baffled. They start laughing and shaking their heads.
      By now the second figure is dangling on the rope, the
      cross making an efficient double-gallows.

</b>      While Francisco's attention has been on the natives,
      Hector has sidled up to him, still hoping to ingratiate
      himself. He talks while they watch the two events, the
      hanging and the meeting.

      Francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is
      saying. Hector shrugs. He takes a small bundle from
      his jacket and gives it to Francisco.
<b>                               FRANCISCO

      Francisco looks Hector straight  in the eye, looking for
      his angle. But this time there   is none. Hector is
      simply a lonely man seeking to  retrieve lost friendship.
      There is a glimmer of sympathy  in Francisco's face.

      parted company. The Deserters still spin at the end of
      their ropes, the Priest praying at their feet.

      and boxes and timber bob in the waves. People make their

      The whole of the camp is eager and shouting. They bring             *
      in the boxes and barrels. A whole harmonium is man-
      handled ashore. Some boys drag it up onto dry sand and
      start to work its bellows. At first only water spurts
      from it, but then a watery note or two is emitted. The
      mood soon becomes festive. Dom Paulo makes his way down             *
      to the shore to make the celebrations official.                     *
      By now the first of the newly-arrived crates are being
      opened. Inside are eggs, many, many large eggs, in
      crate after crate.
      An OFFICER brings the first of the eggs to Dom Paulo.

      fires in the dusk they fry them, boil them, scramble
      them. Some eat them raw. The abundant green fruits
      make a tolerable side dish. The happy mood of the
      afternoon has survived into the night. For once there
      is enough to eat, and the hangings are a thing of the
      past. Above the ROAR of the constantly rolling SURF
      the CROAKY sounds of the waterlogged HARMONIUM can be

      is a brown smudge of dried yoke and some dust. Hector            *
      grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg. The yoke is

      couple, and then retires to his tent. The others work
      on at the table. Hector drifts off down to the beach.

      takes off the heavy silver chain and medallion from

      stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its
      hiding place in the sand floor. Then he adorns himself
      in the cheap rosary and other trashy items. Dom Paulo,               *

      is looking for, a piece of wood with some nails still
      attached to it. He pulls out the nails and pockets them,
      then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more.
      Hector is a survivor. And not the first Hector to
      scavenge on a beach, in a world that feels big and empty.


<b>112   EXT. DUNES - MORNING                                         112
</b>      Hector is enjoying the   freshness of the day. We see              *
      him climb over a dune   and then as he nears the summit
      duck and retreat down   the slope again. Cautiously he
      crawls up the dune and   looks over to the other side.

      He is watching a young Girl and the boy Nuno. They are
      twelve or thirteen years old. They are coyly in the
      early stages of making love, the Boy lying close to the
      Girl, kissing her, beginning to caress her. Their                  *
      love-making is poised oddly between child's play and               *
      eroticism. It's their day of discovery and it is like
      a dream of love.
      The Boy is just about to   discover some more and is
      fumbling with the Girl's   clothing, when he looks up and
      catches sight of Hector.    Hector ducks down but knows he
      has been seen and decides   to brazen it out. He stands
      up in full view of them.

</b>                   Stop that... leave her alone...

                   this when there are people needing
                   your help back there...?
      The Boy is standing now and fixing his clothing. He walks
      off back to the camp. The Girl remains sitting in the
      sand, buttoning her dress, too embarrassed even to raise
      her head to Hector.

      Then Hector is touched by something, perhaps the sad stoop
      in the Boy's shoulder or the Girl's lowered head. Hector
      realizes he has broken something precious and in their
      circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable. He
      feels like an oaf. He calls after the Boy.

</b>      But the Boy walks on, turning around now and then to look
      at Hector, who feels foolish and mean. Hector calls down
      to the Girl.

      But she doesn't look up, still fumbling with her buttons.
      Hector curses quietly and looks out across the dunes,
      angry with himself. Then he sees the procession of the               *
      Native King and his people, some cattle, and porters
      carrying baskets.
      Hector runs off towards the camp.

      to see. The ragged Europeans, already scanning the                   *
      baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food,
      somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own                    *
      importance for the occasion. The Natives, excited and                *
      curious, trying to contain their exuberance so that they             *
      don't miss a single detail of this most significant
      day. Many of the Natives have climbed into the trees,                *
      either out of timidity or to get a better view                       *

      The trees around the meeting place are dripping with
      bodies, like human fruit.
      Hector slips into the crowd as the NATIVE KING is in
      mid-speech. When he has stopped talking the Slave begins
      to haltingly translate.

      He begins to open up his coat and shirt. The four
      Officers do the same. The King and a few of his atten-
      dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed
      white European bellies. They look at one another and
      mumble solemnly. Then they step back. Dom Paulo and the
      Officers fix their clothing and re-muster their dignity.
      The King is enjoying himself.    He speaks again to the
      Slave, who then translates.

</b>                   He wants to see you breathe.
      The King takes a deep breath, then nods to Dom Paulo.
      Dom Paulo and the Officers do as they are told. The King
      joins them, and for a few moments there is a kind of
      communion between them. Then everyone joins in. It is a            *
      strange, poignant moment, all the Natives and all the
      Europeans united in the simple act of breathing.
      Dom Paulo regains his composure.    He speaks to the Slave.

      back for a long time. Then the Slave translates again.

      see the pieces of broken copper inside.

      gives them directly to the King. The King nods his
      head in approval and shows the nails to his attendants.
      They are impressed.

      This is translated.    The King refuses to accept the               *
      rosary. Instead he    is pointing to a couple of chunky
      and valuable-looking   rings on Dom Paulo's fingers which
      he has forgotten to   remove.

                   not insist that he take your

      It is impossible to know if the King is being naively
      polite or hugely clever. Dom Paulo's Officers enjoy a
      muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and
      gives them to the King, replacing the worthless baubles
      around his own neck. The King begins talking again.
      The Slave translates.

      The King and his followers walk back into the forest.               *
      Soon the survivors are alone again, with the lost-
      looking cow the Natives have left. A doomed cow if
      ever there was.

</b>      The remains of the cow hang on the spit over the large
      fire the survivors have made on the beach. Small groups
      of people sit around it, gnawing on the roasted flesh.
      The image is once again timeless, the elements of it
      simple; man, fire, flesh, food.
      One cow doesn't go far between a hundred starving people.
      Some are still on their feet by the large fire. Now and
      then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a
      bone hanging loose or a tasty-looking piece of gristle.
      They are the survivors of the pack, if any will be.

      Hector is, of course, among them. He    risks the searing
      heat to pull at a couple of blackened   bones. He sees
      Nuno, the boy he chased away from the   Girl earlier in
      the day. Nuno is sitting by himself,    staring vacantly
      at the fire, licking his fingers.

      all; the cliffs, the ocean, the kneeling Hector,     a pile
      of stones, the offering to a god.

      perhaps by the music, or perhaps by the simple, universal            *
      posture of worship itself. They begin to sing, a low,
      rhythmic, compelling chant. It mingles with the distant
      voice of Father Diogo, and then with the chanting voices
      of all the Europeans, until it seems that the whole
      world is praying.

      The place is like a junkyard. The      amount of damage that
      a hundred and fifty people can do     to a beach in two days

      With them are some messengers from     the king, and the
      Slave translator.
      One of the messengers is talking.     When he finishes, the

      by the sight of her, ashen and fevered, but tries not to

      Hector is lying awake, watching Bobby's sleeping form on
      the ground at the other side of the dying fire. Behind
      Bobby is a wolf, sniffing and edging his way closer to
      them. Hector isn't anxious. He knows the wolf will soon
      become aware of them and move off. He is worried about
      something else. From under the pack that makes his
      pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow, a shaft and some
      feathers, the other end of Bobby's find. He looks at it,
      then looks back to Bobby and the wolf.

      Hector and Bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock
      looking out across the broad valley.
      They are building a pile of stones, a cairn. They work
      quietly, methodically. The only sounds are of their
      breathing and the CLICK-CLACK of the stones. We feel the
      echoes of our many previous Hectors and their piles of
      stones, built for this or that purpose. Our doomed
      surveyors are acting out the same ritual, this time in
      the name of science.
      They finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over
      it, and dangle a plumb line from the tripod. Bobby
      scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn.
      They are establishing a survey point. They talk as they
      work.

      When they anchor their   tripod, the cold hard sound of
      their CHISELS STRIKING   ROCK ECHOES all through the forest.
      It unnerves them. They    stop hammering and listen to the
      ECHO BOUNCING down the   valley.

      horse, in an atmosphere of controlled panic.

      horse's nose, finding comfort in the closeness of each

      off again. Still they don't talk. We can feel their
      anxiety breeding in the silence. Why don't they talk?
      They proceed in this weighty silence, but even the CRIES
      of the BIRDS now seem to mock them.

      The route takes them downhill. The slopes are more dense
      with undergrowth now and the going isn't so easy. Some-
      times they are reduced to an undignified scramble, hanging
      onto the bulk of the horse between them. They no longer
      look much like conquerors of the wilderness.

      They are on the valley floor now. The trees are more
      openly spaced and the grass is richer. They are moving
      quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on
      the trot. It hasn't seen grass this good in weeks.

      They are moving more slowly, the ground is rockier and
      the trees are thickening. They take the easy way up the
      hillside, a natural path made by deer or bear.
      It is difficult to know who is more shaken by their
      encounter, the Indian or Hector and Bobby.
      The INDIAN is sitting behind a tree as they pass, dozing
      or deep in reverie. They almost pass without noticing
      him, but Hector gives a turn of his head and there is the
      Indian four feet from him. At the same instant the Indian
      comes to his senses and sits bolt upright. The encounter
      is high comedy but full of terror for all of them.

      The Indian stands up.       Hector absurdly greets him.

      The Indian backs off from them, holding his hands up and
      smiling crazily, as if to say, "Don't mind me, boys, I'm
      just leaving..." Hector and Bobby are equally silly in
      their response.

      apologetically, but making good distance from them.
      Suddenly, he is gone. It has happened so quickly that
      Hector and Bobby scarcely believe it has happened. Then
      they realize that in their fright they have let go of the
      horse. It has headed back down to the tastier pastures

      ing it with foliage. Half-hidden in the undergrowth, it
      is big enough for two men to huddle in. Tonight they feel
      the most basic of urges, to curl up in a ball and hide.

      They are safe and snug in their hideaway. Hector has lit
      his candle. He is reading his letters, holding them close
      to his eyes in the dimness. He has the air of someone
      putting his affairs in order. Bobby is thinking aloud.

                no wonder... they used to farm on

      Hector takes a last look at their shelter and its little
      memorial cairn and then runs to catch up with Bobby.

      the open forest with their meager packs on their backs.

                   moving... we have to get away from
                   here.
      Behind them they don't see the figure moving from the
      cover of one tree to another, and then another figure
      following the first. They move like ghosts.

      Bobby is a few steps ahead of Hector. He dips down
      over a rise, and instantly returns. He throws himself
      and Hector to the ground. Hector tries to struggle free.

      Hector ducks lower, hugging the ground. Bobby is
      already sliding up the slope to look over the rise.
      Hector follows him.

</b>      On the other side, they see the women and children of
      a small group of Indians at the edge of a stream. The
      women are washing clothes, the children are splashing and
      playing. We are close enough to hear their laughter.

      Bobby turns to Hector to make his point. That is when he
      sees the first of the figures, just the ghost of a shadow
      moving from tree to rock. His eyes flick across the
      forest behind them. He sees another figure caught in
      the act of seeking cover, looking absurdly embarrassed
      for the fleeting moment that we see it. Then Bobby
      sees another. Are they teasing them? It looks so much
      like a game children would play.

                   think we're stalking the women...
      Hector looks and sees nothing. Fifty Indians hold their
      breath. The forest seems empty. But Hector looks at
      Bobby. He is grey-faced, a man who is looking at death.
      Hector knows they are doomed.

</b>      They leap to their feet and run. There is only one
      way to go, over the rise, through the women and children
      and across the stream. To the watching Indians it looks
      like a direct attack on their families. From behind
      trees and rocks they emerge and begin the chase. A
      tragedy of misunderstanding.

      tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over

      every earnest pronouncement that he makes.

</b>      A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five o'clock on
      a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence
      whatever you do with it, and that's fine.
      Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us
      than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of
      our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did
      or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the
      threads together.
      And after so many images of the natural world, a world
      little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in
      all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen-
      sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film,
      when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit,
      then it will be somewhere around here that it happens.
      Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching
      for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New
      Jersey Hector will complete his journey.
      We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the
      avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE
<b>      RINGS ONCE.
</b>
<b>                                 HECTOR

                   we're insured... thank God... yes
                   now I know God's a lawyer...
                   thanks...
      On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban
      street he is looking for. If the last crosslight holds
      on green then he might even make it on time.
      Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out
      a sigh of relief.

      Hector's former wife, JANET, and her new husband, DONALD,
      come out of the house as Hector walks up to the door.
      Donald is carrying luggage and heads straight for their
      car in the driveway.

                   fixed up something else. I

                   learn... Check into a hotel if
                   it gets too much... they like

                   over a couple of nights and got

      about thirteen, and TOM, who is eleven.

      Hector nods his head obediently. He always did with
      Janet. The children let their mother pat them and follow
      Hector to his car, eyes to the ground.

      The kids load themselves into the back of Hector's car.

      Betsy notices the huge arrangement of flowers, wrapped
      in cellophane and red ribbon. It seems to have grown
      even larger than before.

      and anxiety.

</b>      For every four items Hector puts in his cart Betsy
      removes three and returns them to the shelf. Hector
      notices and puts up with it for a while. But when Betsy
      returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he
      makes a stand. He turns to face her.

      She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from
      the shelf and throws it into the cart. Hector has the
      sense to back down.

      Hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to
      the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in
      the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some
      reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few
      brief moments they are talking without words as their
      tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of
      the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the
      twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are
      back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the
      back of the car the kids have watched it all.
      Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he
      climbs back into the car.

      asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep,
      searching for some traces of the little children that
      have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots
      he abandoned.

      The car pulls up at the holiday house. Hector gets out.
      It is dark, but we can hear the sound of the SEA and
      there is sand underfoot. Hector walks to the house and
      unlocks the door. He puts on a couple of exterior lights.
      He carries Thomas, still sleeping, from the car and into
      the house. Betsy follows him, still half-asleep, groaning
      fussily. She talks through her yawns.

</b>      Later, Hector can't sleep. It has been too eventful a
      day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW.
      A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking
      to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones
      which he regularly scatters on the floor.

      Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier
      Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He
      stands up and leaves the room.

      is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is fast asleep.

      She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a
      tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully.

      Hector is a confusion of feelings: frightened,
      fascinated, impotent. How can he help her? How could he
      possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort
      could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is
      a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than
      the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door.

      subsided. Just as he is closing the door he gets
      another surprise, this time from the sleeping Thomas.

      The light DRIZZLE now falling is keeping away what few                *
      fun-seekers there are left in town. The Funfair is not
      much fun. It is the end of the season. Hector and the                 *
      kids are a sorry sight parading the empty alleys. The
      kids seem to glory in the misery of it all, getting back
      at Hector for four years of neglect. Heavy-hearted,
      Hector still tries to make a go of it.

      his pocket and starts to wipe the seats.

      Betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb
      aboard the rockets.

      As the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up
      into the drizzle, 'round and 'round, Hector knows that he
      has to do something to break the awful distance between
      him and his kids. He looks at them. They sit grimly in
      their rockets, one in front of him and one behind. Their
      faces are set in expressions of what? Boredom?
      Resignation? Patience? Expectancy? Then he realizes
      what is going on. They are waiting for him to open up to
      them, talk to them seriously, explain himself. He looks
      at Betsy's face and sees in it the years of his absence,
      her stoicism, her patience, her courage. It moves him.
      He leans over to her.

      Hector looks to Thomas. Thomas vigorously nods his

      decrepit fairground.

<b>                                 HECTOR
</b>                   Oh, God, Betsy. I'm sorry.

      Betsy is still crying.
<b>                                 BETSY
</b>                   It doesn't matter.

<b>                                BETSY
</b>                   I passed.
      Hector leaves his limp arm on her shoulder. It is too                *
      soon for gestures of emotion. After a long moment she
      speaks.

</b>                   I'm a life-saver now.

      Hector doesn't make the obvious comment. His emotions
      are full. He hides his feelings in a gruff call to
      Thomas.

      Hector turns from his work. Out at sea the kids look
      small and vulnerable. Hector is more anxious than he
      should be, out of practice at fatherhood. He calls to
      them.

      Hector tries to relax, but he doesn't have the
      confidence yet, or something. He is edgy.

<b>                                 HECTOR

                   want to lose you. What would I
                   tell your mother... come on in...

      He walks down to the water. The kids reluctantly pull
      on the oars and bring the little boat in. A few feet
      from the beach they hit some sand. The boat sticks.
      Hector wades out in his shoes so far. Then he calls
      to Thomas.

      Thomas throws the mooring rope to Hector. It isn't
      attached to the boat. Hector ends up with all of the
      rope in his hands. He stands there, and they all laugh.

      standing on the shoreline with a length of     rope. An
      image with an echo from six thousand years     ago. But
      this time Hector is laughing, and his kids     are safe.

</b>      At the very moment of sunset Betsy is trying to capture
      it in a watercolor sketch. She has set up an easel on
      the beach. It's like action painting. She works
      frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips
      into the ocean. Tough little Betsy can even lose
      patience with the sun.

      Thomas is laughing at her. He has seen    her attempt this
      before. Hector has other concerns. He     is trying to
      light his barbecue. Match after match    disappears into
      his elaborate stone structure, only to   fizzle out.

      The sun finally vanishes, and Betsy goes limp at her
      easel. The sun has won the race again. She and Thomas
      watch Hector trying to light the fire. After a while
      he is conscious of their amused attention on him, then
      he becomes a little self-conscious.
<b>                              HECTOR

<b>                                 THOMAS
</b>                   Yeah. We're making such a mess of
                   the world, one day we're going to
                   have to take off for somewhere
                   else...
<b>                                 HECTOR
</b>                   Sounds like Donald said that...

      Hector realizes how far his kids have travelled from
      him. He looks at them.

<b>                                 HECTOR
</b>                   Well, I'm glad you two are thinking
                   about the old planet. I'm proud
                   of you. Look how beautiful
                   everything is. Sometimes I think
                   it's people that make it all
                   wrong... we walk around with all
                   our problems...

      Betsy chimes in.
<b>                                 BETSY
</b>                   I don't know. If it wasn't for
                   us there'd be nobody around to
                   see it all.
      Hector stands to fetch another baked potato from the fire.
      We see the three of them in a WIDE SHOT, the evening sky
      now pulsing with more and more points of light. Hector's
      voice and laughter carry to us.
<b>                                 HECTOR
</b>                   Don't worry, you two... I'll tell
                   you... it's just a big, black
                   sheet up there with holes in it
                   so the light comes through...
                   that's the truth... the very
                   latest...
      Hector has come to rest, and found peace at last, however
      temporary, here on the beach, beneath the same stars that
      our first Hector wailed at six thousand years ago.
      On Monday he will face the music. The kids will go
      back home, Mrs. Philippopolis will have to be dealt with,
      and the wilting three hundred dollar bouquet of flowers.
      In general, life will take over, on Monday. But at this
      moment of calm on the beach, let's leave him while he's
      ahead.

      darkening beach and light-laden sky.

                   of dust that's lying in a ball of
                   fluff in the cuff of a pair of
                   pants hanging over the back of a
                   chair...

                   thing... stars and everything...
                   is sitting on the skin of a bubble
                   of milk in a bowl of cornflakes...
                   and somebody's just about to eat
                   it...
      The three of them are laughing now.

      Perhaps that's just about as close as Hector and his                *
      tribe of humans will ever come to working it all out.
      But they try.                                                       *
