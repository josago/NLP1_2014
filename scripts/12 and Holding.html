</b>          TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes
          through a suburban neighborhood.
<b>          
</b>          Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck
          pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears
          over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The
          boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          Rudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop.
          Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a
          TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys
          cautiously look around and whisper.

</b>                     No. But that doesn't mean they're
                     not here.
<b>          
</b>          After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking
          towards the tree house.   Jacob stays behind, eyeing their
          safety.

                     Jacob, come on. It's cool.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.   It hits
          Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground.
<b>          
</b>          Rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and
          debris come flying at him.
<b>          
</b>          As Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his
          mask. He quickly runs for the tree.
<b>          
</b>          TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come
          running out of the woods, rocks in hand.
<b>          
</b>          Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are
          nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a
          DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and
          unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.

</b>          Now drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree,
          screaming. They try to shake the urine off.
<b>          
</b>          Kenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up
          to the boys.

</b>                       Leonard has a condition.    It's
                       called Anosmia.
<b>

</b><b>                                 DOCTOR
</b>                       No. Anosmia is when a person
                       looses their sense of smell. It's
                       not uncommon in patients who suffer
                       serious head injuries.
                       Unfortunately, it's also affecting
                       his ability to taste. Again, not
                       uncommon.

<b>          
</b><b>                                 DOCTOR
</b>                       Leonard's association with food is
                       no longer about taste. It's about
                       texture. While we may be partial
                       to sweet or salty foods, Leonard
                       will become partial to crunchy or
                       smooth ones. Once he settles on a
                       texture he likes, his appetite will
                       increase.

</b>                       Considering what Leonard could have
                       suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he
                       is severely overweight. A loss of

</b>                              LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)

                    Maybe you'll like the crunch.
<b>          
</b>          The nurse exits. Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A
          beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud
          CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a

                       construction. He got an offer to
                       build that extension off Lindsay
                       Acres. He suggested I come into

                       I went to work today. For the
                       first time in weeks. It was as if
                       I had just gotten out of college!
                       I was fearless! I went after
                       accounts I had avoided for years
                       because I thought they were out of
                       my league. I spoke to presidents,
                       vice presidents, business managers,
                       sales reps. I was amazing. I was
                       magic. But when I came home to
                       share the news with your mother, I
                       discovered her asleep. When I
                       looked around the house, I realized
                       that her "office", for lack of a
                       better word, was also piled up.
                       So, I took to the house. I have
                       made it my duty to clean this place
                       from top to bottom. Even if it
                       takes me all night, I don't care.
