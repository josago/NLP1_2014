          CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES...
          The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows...
          The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands.

          ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands.

          Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time.
          The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues
          staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly
          he breaths in.

          Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this
          is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing
          at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the
          far wall.

          Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a
          tight fist.

          Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other.
          The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which
          way the fight will turn.

          One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts
          changing hands...

          The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way
          though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him
          here.

          Again bets are placed....

          PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late
          thirties).

          Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing
          his arm around him, pulling him in close.

<b>                          BILLY
</b>           ... I love violence!

          Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey.
          Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight.

          BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is
          immediately on the ropes.

          Julian watches, concerned.

          Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian
          and takes it outside.

          BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the
          tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings
          and backfists.

          As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the
          auditorium.

          Liang wins the fight with a knock out... The crowd go wild with
          adulation...

          Julian watches, transfixed...

          Liang is lit up by a beatific white light... As he stands triumphant
          in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him...
          Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him...

          ... Which is almost like a religious ceremony... The audience
          bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light... A look
          of calm washing over his face... A sense of stillness and peace...
          Enlightenment through victory and violence...

          Liang is sitting on a bench, his constantly-smiling Mother beside
          him, as Julian peels off fifty Bhat notes.
          We get the sense that Julian's proud of him, that Liang is something
          of a protege of his and that Liang is incredibly pleased to have
          gained his approval.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Two fifty, three hundred...

          Liang takes the money. Julian pulls off two more notes. A bonus.

          A Thai man - known as The Lizard - sits by a table with a few
          locals gambling...
          He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to
          gamble.
          Billy moves across to a small private corner...
          ... where he meets various men and women, all smoking
          Methamphetamine. Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts
          up between him and another Thai Man.
          The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it
          suddenly gets out of control... Billy starts viciously hitting
          the Thai Man and quickly the room EXPLODES in a frenzy of violence.

          Julian's lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend he's got...
          Julian's phone rings. He interrupts his counting. Picks up and

          a cigarette at the same time as he stems the flow of blood from

          Julian and Gordon arrive.

           a real problem...
          Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices
          this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly.

</b>           You're not going to cause another
           ruckus in my club now - are you?
          A long pause as Julian considers it.

          Julian turns to Gordon.

<b>                          GORDON

           in? Very good amphetamine in here...
          Julian looks over to Gordon. Sees he's keen.

          He turns back to The Lizard.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Which way'd he go?
          The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns
          and heads off... Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club.
          The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way.

<b>                          THE LIZARD
</b>           His brother didn't pay.

</b>           So? That's his problem.

<b>                          THE LIZARD

          A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares

          Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few
          to Ma Long.

          No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his
          body and slowly opens the door.
          Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's

          Julian nods and closes the door. He stands still - glances out
          the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in. He
          glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed.
          He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on
          make up.

          Satisfactory.
          The Porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her

          The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling
          the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail.
          Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and
          takes a huge slug.
          The Porter is terrified, stunned. Rooted to the spot.
          Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. Just as the
          Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she

          The Porter nods, uncertain. Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse.
          Opens it up. A picture of Billy.
          She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it,
          not knowing what to do...
          Jenna starts to cry. For a long time. Finally...

          Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching...
          Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the
          bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor.
          Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket.
          The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into
          the kiosk that doubles as their home.
          Julian and his men close in.

<b>          INT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK
</b>
          As Choi Yan Lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss
          of him, the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly SLAMMED

<b>          SHUT.
</b>          They all turn round in panic, but before they can do anything
          about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk,
          followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian.
          Choi Yan Lee snivels in the corner, waving his bandaged arm in
          the air.

<b>           CHOI YAN LEE
</b>
<b>                          (IN THAI)
</b>           You can't kill me. I'm a cripple.

</b>           Who are you? What do you think you're
           doing? Get out or we'll call the police.
          Ko Sam shakes his head at her. Not a good idea. Julian turns to
          Charlie Ling.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.
          At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's
          face. His eyes lock with Julian's.

<b>                          CHARLIE LING

          Choi Yan Lee nods his head.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Ask him why he killed my brother.

<b>                          CHARLIE LING
</b>
<b>                          (IN THAI)
</b>           You killed his brother. Big mistake fat
           man. Why'd you do it?
          Beat. Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught...

<b>           CHOI YAN LEE
</b>
<b>                          (IN THAI)

<b>                          CHARLIE LING
</b>           He says he killed his daughter.
          Julian considers him for a moment. Slowly he pulls out a gun...
          Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face...

<b>           CHOI YAN LEE
</b>
<b>                          (IN THAI)
</b>           Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please.
           I'll give you anything. Anything you
           want. My daughters. My shop. Please.
           I've paid for what I did. Look at me.
          In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward,
          brandishing his wounded arm at Julian. He pulls the bandages off,
          exposing the bloody stump.

<b>           CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)
</b>

          Julian turns to Charlie Ling.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           What's he saying?
          Beat.

           he's done. That he's been punished
           already.
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.

<b>           CHOI YAN LEE
</b>
<b>                          (IN THAI)
</b>           He told me to do it. Then he took my
           hand. Look.
          Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Who did that to him?
          Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then
          stares directly at Julian.

</b>           The Angel of Vengeance...
          Charlie Ling looks at him surprised... yet there's a sense that
          deep down he knows what he's talking about...

<b>                          CHARLIE LING

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           What's he saying?

<b>                          CHARLIE LING

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Tell me.

<b>                          CHARLIE LING
</b>           It's a story old women tell their grand
           children... 'The Angel of Vengeance'
           is supposed to come down from the
           heavens and judge the living...
           restore karma to the world..
          Gordon laughs... but Julian listens with great interest...

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           How does he do that?

<b>                          CHARLIE LING
</b>           Leads people to their destiny...
           That's the myth anyway.
          Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally:

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Ask him who cut his hand off.
          Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Do it.

<b>                          CHARLIE LING

</b>           Who turned you into a cripple - and no

          Choi Yan Lee continues babbling hysterically...

           already been judged.

<b>                          CHARLIE LING
</b>           He says it was The Angel of Vengeance...
          Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably.

<b>           CHOI YAN LEE
</b>

</b>           The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't

          Choi Yan Lee retreats to the corner of the room.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           What did he say?
          Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to
          get a better answer out of him...

<b>                          CHARLIE LING
</b>           He said you don't find The Angel of
           Vengeance. He finds you...
          Julian considers this for a long time. He realises he's not pointing
          his gun anymore. Puts it away.

<b>                          GORDON
</b>           Are we going to kill him or what?
          The room suddenly feels stuffy. The atmosphere oppressive.
          Julian's got to get out...

<b>                          GORDON (CONT'D)
</b>           What are you doing?
          But Julian's already stumbling out of the kiosk...

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Nothing... We're not going to do

          Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air.
          Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious
          artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha
          flying...
          He falls to the ground. When he gets to his feet everything around
          him seems intense and incredibly vibrant... The dogs fighting
          on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the
          children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of
          the kiosk, hiding their guns...
          Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings... Finally he stands
          up, but as he does he feels different... As if the axis of his
          world has shifted...

          She spots Julian and Gordon through the large windows of the office.

          the street. Liang pulls out a knife which glints in the light

          Liang asks Choi Yan Lee a question. Choi Yan Lee leans over to
          hear him better. Liang GRABS hold of his hair and PULLS him over
          the counter, SLITTING his throat with the knife.
          Choi Yan Lee's wife and daughters look on as blood floods from
          his neck, over the sweets and snacks on sale and down to the ground

          stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of

          The cops back off and away.
          ZOOM IN on Julian. Deflated and strangely disappointed... He turns
          to Gordon who's standing behind him.

          Three people sit around a table awkwardly. Julian, Jenna and Mai
          (dressed very conservatively) all eating soup. A long silence.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           So... May, isn't it?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           It's Mai, Mum.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           How long have you two known each other
           then?
          Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           A year and a half isn't it?
          Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head...

<b>                          MAI
</b>           ...that sounds about right.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Well it's always a rare treat to meet
           one of Julian's lady friends.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Mum, please...

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           So, where did you two meet?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I saw her walking down the street.
          Jenna raises an eyebrow...

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           And I thought - this is the most
           beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I
           just walked up to her and started
           talking.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           I hear that happens a lot in this part
           of the world... Tell me, what's your
           line of work, Mai?

<b>                          MAI
</b>           I work in the service industry.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before
           you started serving my son, how many
           cocks were you serving? Was it over a
           thousand?
          Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief.

<b>                          JENNA (CONT'D)
</b>           I know girls like you. Just because you
           might be pulling the wool over my son's
           eyes don't think it's going to work with
           me.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by
           and let a dirty little hooker take
           advantage of my son in the vain hope
           that her womb isn't so diseased that
           she can trick him into impregnating her
           and putting another cocksucking child
           on to this earth.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Leave her alone Mum. You've got her
           wrong. She's a good girl.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           What do you know about what's good?
          Beat. Julian says nothing.

<b>                          MAI
</b>           He's good to me...

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really
           happy for you--

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Mum!
          A pause.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           The cops came by my club today.
          Beat. She stares at him.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           They're investigating a murder. The
           guy that killed Billy turned up dead
           this morning.
          Jenna looks bored. Lights a cigarette.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Oh really, shame that, still, live by
           the sword, die by the sword...

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I know it was you, Mum.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           I did what had to be done.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           He was there. He was with them.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Who?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           The Angel of Vengeance.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           D'you kill him?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           No.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Cause he as good as killed Billy. What
           I want to know is, what are you going
           to do about it?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I'm not going to kill him...

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Yes you are. You're going to do it for
           me and you're going to do it for your
           brother.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           This isn't about Billy. This is about
           me. All my life I've been running...

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           That's right you cunt, cause you always
           run away whenever there's a problem...
           just like you're running away from
           killing this fucking Angel of whatever

<b>                          -
</b>
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           - his name is Chang-

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Chang?!
          Mai stands up.

<b>                          MAI
</b>           I should be going now.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Sit down you cunt.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Mum, don't talk to her like that.
          Mai sits down.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           So what am I left with?
          Julian stares at her.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Me.
          Jenna calms down. She looks at their reflections in the mirror
          behind the bar. We ZOOM in on the mirror, their faces refracted
          by the glass.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           You're right. We're family. We stick
           together. But Billy was family too.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Billy was a fuck up... He deserved
           everything he got. You know it and I
           know it.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           That's it. I'm not listening to this.
           I don't ever want to hear you mention
           his name again... Do you hear me?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Yeah we were brothers, but we were never
           close... And he was only in Bangkok
           cause you couldn't control him. So you
           sent him to me--

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           -- So you sent him to me and what could
           I do?

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           You could have protected him.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I did what I could. And that's more than
           you ever did.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           I would've done anything for him. Okay,
           he wasn't born with as many advantages
           as you were. He struggled with things.
           But I always stood by him.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           And what did that get him? I'll tell
           you what, a one way ticket to this
           fucking place, just like me.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Don't you dare blame me for what
           happened back then.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I'm only here 'cause of you. If you
           didn't exist, I wouldn't be here.
          Beat.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           I could've been someone, Mum. I was on
           my way...
          Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like
          having...

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           You would've been a great fighter...
           You could've gone pro.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Don't you think I know that? And look
           at me now. I'm a front for a drugs
           smuggling.
          He turns to Mai.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           It's true... The whole thing's a front.
           Every day I see kids coming in with great
           potential. And every day I see kilos
           of heroin going out. And it's all
           because of you, Ma. You and the money
           and the drugs.
          Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up.
          He quietens down...

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           At least you're not behind bars and
           that's more important to me.
          Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say
          this.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           That's right Mum. That's what's more
           important to you. But what about me?
           Sometimes I think you only got me out
           of there so the cops couldn't trace it
           back to you...
          Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           ...that's right Mum. Think about it.
           With me gone you were safe. And it turned
           out to be good for business as well.
           All very convenient.
          Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands
          now shaking.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Is that what happened with Billy? Did
           Billy become a problem like I did?
           Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big
           fucking problem when he was here...
           Still, at least you didn't have him
           killed.
          Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at
          her. Very intense.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum.
           Doesn't matter what you say. And do you
           want to know why?

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Surprise me.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the
           ring. Me versus him.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Well that seems sensible... And what
           do you hope that's going to achieve?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I don't expect you to understand. Cause
           you don't understand anything that
           isn't about you.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           And when you lose, what's going to
           happen then?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I don't know... But maybe this time I'll
           win. Like you say, only God forgives.
           Maybe this time he'll forgive me...
          Jenna turns to Mai.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Do you understand what he's talking
           about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking
           a clue.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           You never did, Mum.
          A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           I hope you find what you're looking for.
           'Cause if you don't, it's going to find
           you and I'm not always going to be there
           to look after you.
          Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person.

<b>                          JENNA (CONT'D)
</b>           Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you
           again soon.
          Jenna shakes her hand. Mai's too shocked to resist. And then,
          as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves.
          Julian covers his face with his napkin.

<b>                          MAI
</b>           Are you alright?
          He's not. He's crying. But he doesn't want anyone to see.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I'm fine.
          Beat.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           I'll be fine. In a minute.
          Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together.

<b>                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Sorry about that.

<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
          Jenna gets out of her cab and walks toward reception, a look of
          steely determination in her eyes.

<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
          The Concierge and the Manager see Jenna coming towards them and
          brace themselves...
          However, to their relief, she diverts to the palm court area where
          Gordon is waiting for her.

<b>                          GORDON
</b>           Nice evening?

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you
           know.
          Jenna sits down. Lights a cigarette.

<b>                          JENNA (CONT'D)
</b>           You're a piece of work, aren't you?
          Gordon blushes. Jenna blows out her match.

<b>                          JENNA (CONT'D)
</b>           No fucking hanging about with you, is
           there?

<b>                          GORDON
</b>           Well, I don't know about that. Just been
           out here a while... Know how to get
           things done.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           I bet you do.

<b>                          GORDON
</b>           But things are going to shit. Since
           Billy died, Julian's all over the
           place...

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           We'll have to something about that the,
           wont we? But, first things first, what
           about Chang?

<b>                          GORDON
</b>           Who?

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           My son's guardian angel.

<b>                          GORDON
</b>           He's just a retired cop...

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           Good, then he won't be to hard to kill,
           will he?

<b>                          GORDON
</b>           It's not that simple... Is there
           somewhere we can go that's a little more
           private?
          Beat. She raises her eyebrows.

<b>                          JENNA
</b>           What did you have in mind?
          Gordon blushes. Moves closer, conspiratorial...

<b>                          GORDON

          Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng
          and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen
          walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE.
          An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all
          the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering
          the room with broken glass.
          Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover.
          Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and
          his white shirt has turned dark red with blood.
          Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair.
          In it, his pistol.
          The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull
          it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting.
          A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's
          jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs
          it and returns fire, letting off four rounds.
          He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman
          Two sees this and sprays at Chang -
          - but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again,
          shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times.
          Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon
          jams. He drops his weapon and runs.
          Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him.
          He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood
          from his chest.
          Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.

          The driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat
          as he waits. As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken,
          running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and
          starts to pull away.
          Gunman Three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down.
          The Driver slows. Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open
          doors.
          Chang bursts out of the restaurant. Stops dead. Aims and fires
          off two rounds.
          Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. The Driver
          falls forward, dead.
          The back door of the van slams shut. Gunman Three thinks he's
          made it. He's wrong. The van isn't going anywhere.
          Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.

          Beat. Chang considers. Looks at Pan who's staring at Chang in
          fear. Looks back at Li Po.

          A people carrier pulls up outside the hotel. The doormen open
          the side door and step back when they see the heavily armed and
          bloodstained policemen get out, led by Chang.

          PICK OUT Dimitri and the group of Russian Criminals. Yuri Karkov
          is in the centre of them, a girl on either arm.
          Chang leads the Cops into the bar. He fires two shots into the
          ceiling. That shuts everyone up and gets the Russian Criminals
          up and ready for a confrontation. Half the bar's emptied by the
          time Chang reaches Yuri Karkov.

          Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone.
          Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white.
          Chang calls a number. A beat. Then a phone starts ringing in
          Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri
          winces. Chang shakes his head.
          Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead. Chang moves his gun across
          to Dimitri. Holds his mobile phone up to his ear.

          WE TRACK IN on Dimitri as he stares at Chang, a rabbit in the

          English.

          what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind
          by Phaiban.
          Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri...

          He pushes the broken bottle into Dimitri's eyes. Gauges them out.
          Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in
          Russian...

          Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind. Chang presses down on
          his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of
          his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off.
          ...Dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying
          animal...
          Chang looks at him and his men release Dimitri who stumbles around

          Chang grabs Dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear. First one
          side, then the other.
          SOUND OUT. We can't hear Dimitri's screaming. We can't hear
          anything at all.
          Beat.
          MUSIC STARTS. Painful and beautiful, but also tacky... The opening
          bars to one of Dolly Parton's classics. Karaoke style.

          Two figures kneel on either side of the ring. Julian and Chang.
          Both wearing Mongkol. Totally still.
          The ceremonial music begins...
          Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient,
          traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried
          out before a fight takes place.
          It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their
          arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing
          shapes and outlining fighting positions.
          As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative;
          now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches
          that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost
          beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about
          to follow...

<b>           FADE OUT.

          The crowd is packed. In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside
          him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident.
          In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple
          of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.
          The first bell sounds. Five second warning...
          Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers
          him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.
          Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.
          The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang
          walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between
          them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges.
          Then a look between the two fighters.
          Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks
          back at him without emotion.

<b>                          (IN THAI)
</b>           Fight.
          Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack
          first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps
          his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right
          leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of
          Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his
          left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's
          too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps
          back.
          Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an
          attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut,
          connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed.
          Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.
          Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back.
          Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off.
          He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot.
          Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike
          with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack
          was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and
          uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects
          with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.
          Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds
          over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs
          and punches to his upper body and face.
          Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to
          the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under
          Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to
          place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him
          fall down.
          Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make
          the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this
          enrages Julian.
          He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a
          high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns
          with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels,
          punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's
          down. But again no killer punch.

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Come on.
          Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.
          Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take
          out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.
          Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a
          look of intense anger and frustration.

          Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting.
          Julian waits for Chang this time. Chang is reluctant to attack.
          A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian
          moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as
          he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own
          kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels,
          using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike
          with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.
          PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and
          Kanita.
          Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches
          and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten.
          He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.

          Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds.
          End of the second round.
          Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang. Nadee comforting
          Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks
          and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing
          Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon...
          End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan
          the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.
          Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring
          into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at
          but can't make it out.
          POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When
          she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the
          fight - urging him to hit harder...
          Jenna then walks back to Gordon...
          On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the
          ring. Looking into the crowd.
          Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous.
          Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of
          the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and
          she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he
          knows...
          The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late.
          He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard.
          The Referee starts counting.
          Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.
          Jenna holds her breath. Hopeful that he might be down and out.
          Kim watches on, concerned.

<b>                          (IN THAI)
</b>           Get up. Please get up.
          After a long, terrible pause... Chang gets up. He looks over into
          the crowd. Makes eye contact with his wife. It's okay.
          She shakes her head. She can't bear it. Tears running down her
          face.
          Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard. Julian hesitates,
          confused. Chang leans in close to him. Winks.

<b>                          CHANG
</b>           It wasn't you, was it?
          Julian shrugs, puts his guard up.

<b>                          CHANG (CONT'D)
</b>           You're innocent.

<b>                          JULIAN

<b>                          CHANG
</b>           It's not your fault.
          Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready
          to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him.
          He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in
          his mind.
          It's not his fault.
          Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left,
          right. Julian just takes them...
          Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the
          middle of the ring.
          Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out
          a roundhouse left kick -
          - which makes contact with Julian's draw.
          SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact.
          He's out cold before he hits the floor.

           he hasn't been a son to me.

          someone the other side of the door.

           Until you catch him.
          Chang starts to push the door open...
          Behind him Jenna stands up.
          Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings. It
          sounds INCREDIBLY loud. He takes it out and looks at the display

          Although the wound isn't life threatening, Julian's face is pale
          from the loss of blood. He looks like a ghost.
          He sees two cops chatting on a street corner. They don't see him,
          they're not even looking for him, but they remind him. Chang.
          It's just a matter of time...
          Julian keeps walking. Wipes sweat from his face. Looking for a
          place to hide. A hole in the ground. Anything.
          Then suddenly it comes to him. A single idea. A possible way of
          escape...

          it instantly has an effect on Julian. He visibly relaxes.
          He doesn't make a sound as he's held down. A plastic strap is
          tied around his arm as a tourniquet. His arm is pulled out.
          Chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then
          his right.
          Julian grits his teeth throughout. Doesn't scream.
          Chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs.
