               Repo Man theme music now begins playing. Map is shown in background 
               (green text on black background), zoomed in on Los Alamos, New 
               Mexico. While remaining credits are shown, the map travels to 
               Sante Fe, then Albuquerque, then begins following US66 west through 
               Arizona to California, finally ending up a few miles east of 
               Goffs (northwest of Needles).

               The motorcycle cop walks around to the back of the car and opens 
               the trunk. The car has New Mexico license plates KBB-283. In 
               every scene after this when the plates are visible, they will 
               be 127-GBH.

               The motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair 
               of flaming boots (a reference to the movie Timerider, which was 
               co-written and produced by Mike Nesmith). Parnell watches from 
               side mirror, where we see that the left side of his sunglasses 
               have no lens.

               Otto grabs Kevin by the front of his shirt, steps around him, 
               and pushes him into the stack of cans (this has been described 
               as a goof but it's clearly just a case of awkward staging used 
               to make the shot work).

                         Take South America for example. In South 
                         America thousands of people go missing 
                         every year. Nobody knows where they 
                         go. They just like disappear. But if 
                         you think about it for a minute, you 
                         realize something. There had to be a 
                         time when there was no people. Right?

               the rear wheels are up on jacks (that it wasn't up on jacks before 
               has been listed as a goof and even confirmed by Alex Cox, but 
               I think they're wrong. It is hard to tell in the dark, but you 
               can see the base of one of the jacks lit up by a light from the 
               house which goes dark as a band member runs in front of it on

</b>                         Radiation, yes indeed! You hear the 
                         most outrageous lies about it. Half-baked 
                         goggle-boxed do-gooders telling everybody 
                         it’s bad for you. Pernicious nonsense! 
                         Everybody could stand a hundred chest 
                         X-rays a year. They ought to have 'em 
                         too. When they canceled the project 
                         it almost did me in. One day my mind 
                         was literally a-burst. The next day 
                         nothing. Swept away... But I showed 
                         them. I had a lobotomy in the end.

                         Designer of the neutron bomb. Ever hear 
                         of the neutron bomb? Destroys people. 
                         Leaves buildings standing. It fits in 
                         a suit case. It's so small no one knows 
                         it's there until blammo. Eyes melt skin 
                         explodes everybody dead. It's so immoral 
                         working on the thing can drive you mad. 
                         That's what happened to this friend 
                         of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's 
                         well again.

               Otto, Marlene and Rodriguez brother drive off and the agents 
               chase them through the parking garage.

               As they drive off and agents run after, the glowing Malibu drives 
               by and strikes down two of the agents with lightening bolts.

               Agent Rogersz blocks the exit and they are all caught.

               Bud is gone.

               They escape the agents. Marlene and the brothers drive off as 
               Otto breaks into and steals a car.

</b>                         Here's another weird one. Reports are 
                         coming in about apparent hail of ice 
                         cubes south of downtown. Scientist are 
                         at a loss to explain the freak showers 
                         of tiny cubes of ice.

</b>               Otto arrives at Helping Hands lot while it rains ice cubes.
