    Seated off to the side, are two male soloists (VINCENT

    men and women, waiting, as:

    suddenly drops his hands to his side. The organist
    discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off:

    grumbles to Helen, a late arriving member of the chorus
    (EDDY REVERE) can be seen taking his seat amongst the

    seated behind a desk in a large deserted classroom:

</b>                 Now I want you to look at Harry
                 and tell him how you feel.

    She turns her gaze to EUGENE EARL AXLINE, alias HARRY
    BLISS. He sits in an adjacent chair, an abject hostage.

    Discomforted by her flinty stare, he glances away, to
    the window where the faint sounds of the CHORAL REHEARSAL
    can be heard.
<b>                               ADELE

                 enough positive feedback...

    Harry shakes his head, shifting about uncomfortably.
<b>                               ADELE
</b>                 See, look at him shaking his head.

                 say here. Harry, how do you feel
                 when she brings out this material?

<b>                               HARRY
</b>                 How do I feel? I feel she just
                 overheats on every little side
                 issue, and when I go to try and
                 communicate with the woman, for
                 some unknown reason she doesn't
                 believe a damn thing I say.

<b>                               ADELE

    removes it, glancing briefly at this heading in bold

    where an attack shepherd (DUKE), slowly unsheathes his
    teeth and fixes her with a threatening stare through the

      lights and sees:

      The living room has been completely savaged. Pictures
      have been pulled from the walls, books have been swept
      from the shelves, chairs are upended and area rugs lie
      rumpled and dislocated. A vase of flowers atop a grand
      piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished
      surface.

      Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden
      patio. The glass pane in one of them is broken and the
      window stands partly open.
      ON Joan's stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the
      room. Then she suddenly reaches to the front door, opens
      it and disappears into the hallway, shutting the door
      after her.

      devastation. Joan, seated on a couch, addresses him:

      piano, and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for prints

     Duke lies on the floor, watching Harry. He stands at a
     cork board on the wall behind his desk, adding a clipping
     announcing the Fourth Victim of a local serial killer
     called the Westside Slasher, to an assortment of other
     items on violent crimes. As he does:

     JUNE HUFF, enters from a door of the rear of the office.
     Moving past Harry's desk, she picks up a folded newspaper
     page, continues to an upholstered bench beneath a window,
     lies down and begins reading.

                  You get with it.
     He sits down at his desk and begins going through his
     drawers, looking for something. She lowers the paper
     and looks over at him:

      Joan is seated at the piano, playing Ravel's "Reverie."
      She breaks off as she sees a dark young man (BALTO) move
      past the living room window. She resumes playing until
      her attention is once again drawn to the window, where
      a middle-aged Hispanic woman SOCORRO moves past in the
      opposite direction with a young man, who now carries a
      suitcase. She rises and crosses to the windows to see
      them get into a gaudy low-rider and begin backing down the
      driveway.

<b>                                JOAN

     The low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap-
     pears onto the street, Joan moves to an electric box
     atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. She
     presses the button and looks at the gates. They remain
     open. She steps over to the gates and tries to close them
     manually. The locking device fails to engage and a
     portion of it falls off into the bushes.



<b>     ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>     As she leans   down to look for the fallen part,   a pickup
     truck can be   seen parked down the street. The    back of the
     driver's head   (BUTCH GABLE) can be seen and on   the side
     panel of the   truck are the words "Canyon Tree   Surgeons."

<b>     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Giving up on the gates, Joan turns and moves with evident
     reluctance up the driveway, passing a three-car garage in
     which her Mercedes and another car hidden under a trap can
     be seen.

     wooded area of the grounds, he leans in close, directing
     her in confidential tones:

</b>                  Alright now, Joan, give him the

</b>                  Good.   The dog is now on alert.

     As they walk, Harry glances about, impressed with the
     appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds:
<b>                                HARRY

     They move forward a few feet, when Harry, now slightly
     behind Joan, makes a covert hand signal in the direction
     of some trees several yards ahead of them.

     June, in a padded attack suit, suddenly jumps out from
     behind the trees, assuming an aggressive stance and
     emitting a repertory of menacing sounds.

     Duke responds immediately, lunging toward June, pulling
     Joan along with him. June screams and starts to run
     away. Harry moves after Joan, yelling ahead to June:

</b>                  Dammit, June, don't exhibit fear

     Seeing the dog still in pursuit, June ignores the command
     and as Duke continues to tow Joan behind him:

                          with Duke)

     He hurries up behind her, grabbing her around the waist
     to anchor her and addressing the dog:

      has gone down and the lights of the city have come on.
      Under the following they cross the driveway to a low
      fence railing off an Oriental garden.
<b>                             JOAN
</b>               You know, it's very sad. I look

               and affairs, not to mention the
               mess my own life is in, and I
               think it's very sad and very bleak
               that men and women can't manage to
               be friends.
<b>                             HARRY
</b>               It depends on the man and woman
               you're talking about.
      They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one
      of her hands on the railings:
<b>                             JOAN
</b>               What a tragedy that sex is often
               such a barrier to friendship

<b>                             HARRY
</b>               There I disagree with you.

      He places his hand over hers. She remains silent a
      moment, restraining her response to the gesture. Then:
<b>                             JOAN
</b>               You know Dante and Beatrice never
               slept together.

      Joan, accompanied by Duke, moves down the driveway to
      a mailbox in front of the broken gates.
      She pauses to lavish the DOG with an exuberant display of
      affection and finds herself intimidated as he responds by
      leaping about and BARKING joyously:

      The excitement has unleashed Duke's libido and as she
      tries to resume her mission, he makes a few attempts to
      rise against her flanks. Just before she approaches the
      mailbox, he manages to grip his paws around one of her
      thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her:

                   that's not nice. Now sitz. And
                   behave yourself.
      He sits, panting, with a furtive expression on his face,
      watching as she steps over to the mailbox and opens it.
      She takes out a number of letters and sorts through them
      as she starts back to the house with Duke following.
      They are in the main addressed to Andy, but in amongst
      them she finds a bank statement addressed to her, as well
      as a letter with her name written in pencil on the
      envelope. She opens it, takes the contents out and stops
      suddenly:

     front of the car. He stops a few feet off and unbuttons
     his jacket, revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder
     holster.

     Harry stands in the parking lot, watching as the Con-

     Joan searches through the file cabinets and not finding
     what she's looking for, goes through a similar course
     of procedure with the desk drawers.

</b>                   But I hear you're a little   sensitive
                   about the criticism you've   had
                   about the amount of sexual   violence
                   and nudity you have in the   picture...

                   Well it's absurd. In the first
                   place, I didn't invent this genre.
                   And it happens to be a tradition
                   in this kind of film that women
                   make more interesting and exciting
                   victims than men do...

      She looks up from the document to the screen. Then both
      women look at each other with their mouths open:

<b>                                 DIRECTOR (V.O.)
</b>                   And secondly the violence directed                      *
                   at Mimi's character is an essential
                   component of the story, and is not
                   in any sense of the word,
                   gratuitous.

</b>                   But, Mimi, now what about you.
                   That scene where you run nude
                   through Times Square with those
                   multiple knife wounds all over
                   your body. That must've been
                   horrendous for you.

      Joan and Helen enter the garage. Joan gets into the
      driver's seat and closes the door, while Helen maneuvers
      on her crutches around to the passenger side.


<b>      ANGLE INSIDE JOAN'S CAR
</b>      Joan turns the IGNITION ON and as she starts to buckle
      herself in, her eye catches the movement of something at
      the back of the garage.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              68.

</b>      From behind a sheet of    plywood resting against the back
      wall of the garage, and    just visible in the darkness, a
      man's hand can be seen    reaching to the handle of an ax in
      amongst other gardening    tools in an iron rack.
      Helen opens the passenger door and Joan whispers to her:

<b>                                 JOAN
</b>                   Helen, quick, get in the car!
      Helen leans down and looks in at her:

<b>                                 HELEN
</b>                   What?

      Looking in the   direction   of Joan's gaze she sees the dark
      figure of a man   wearing a   hood over his head, stepping
      out from behind   the sheet   of plywood, holding the ax in
      his hand and as   he moves   toward the front of the car, she
      screams.
      He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio-
      lently, cleaving the blade into the hood of the Mercedes.
      (From inside the house, DUKE can be heard BARKING
      furiously.)
      Joan leaps from the car and in stark terror, runs out of
      the garage toward the house. Stopped by the sounds of
      HELEN'S HYSTERIA, she turns around to see her, hampered
      by her crutches and unable to move.
      ON the hooded man's eyes, shifting their homicidal intent
      from Helen to Joan.

      Joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to
      pull Helen away from her death grip on the door handle.
      The man begins stalking around the front of the car
      toward her. She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises
      it up as if to hit him. As he steps back to the ax and
      tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at
      him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. He lifts
      an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con-
      tinues to tug at the ax handle.
<b>                                  JOAN
</b>                   Helen!   Help me!

<b>                                  HELEN
</b>                   I can't!   I can't move!!

      Raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced
      to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with
      Joan continuing to batter at him. Then in a sudden burst
      of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her
      grasp and lunges at her.

       Socorro steps into the room. The door automatically
       closes behind her. Duke, in a frenzy, leaps at her, then
       runs toward the glass doors. He hurls himself at the
       glass, then returns to Socorro. Thinking he's gone
       rabid, she screams and tries to hide behind one of the
       weight racks. The above course of procedure continues,
       with Duke trying desperately to indicate his intentions,
       chasing Socorro around and over the press benches and
       exercise paraphernalia.

</b>       (Helen SCREAMING OVER:) The hooded man has Joan up
       against the garage wall. One of his hands is on her
       throat and the other is held over her mouth. In the
       struggle, she manages to sink her teeth into his hand.
       He pulls it free and hits her across the face. She
       reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole-axes
       him on the top of the head. It staggers him briefly and
       enables her to move out of his grasp. She immediately
       grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns
       fiercely toward him.
       Now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently
       having had enough, he begins to back away from her. When
       he reaches a safe distance, he turns and moves quickly
       off, disappearing into the dark.

      lawn toward the van and is stopped mid stride as a strong
      spray from the hose hits him squarely on the back.

      makes a half-hearted attempt to enthuse as she tries to
      secure the clasp. (The empty box and the card rest on
      the table next to the watch he used to deceive his way
      into the house.)

      He leans over and kisses her on the cheek, then picks up
      his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food.

     She resumes eating. Then, desirous of     drawing his atten-
     tion, she fixes her gaze on the table    top and smiles
     pensively, making the assumption that    he is looking at
     her. When no response is forthcoming,     she attempts a
     verbal solicitation:

     a government office building, encircled by a picket of

      main corridors of the hospital. As they edge past a
      laundry cart outside a utility room, Harry releases her
      hand. She moves ahead, then experiencing a sudden loss
      of nerve, stops and looks back to see Harry rummaging
      through the dirty laundry.

     Joan thrusts her skirt at Andy:

<b>                            ANDY

                  don't you? To force you into
                  signing some kind of agreement

     She extracts a tissue from a dispenser on the nightstand:

<b>                                ANDY (CONT'D)
</b>                  He said I was the only woman he's

                         (blowing her nose)
                  ... he had a tear in his eye...

     Joan's jaw goes slack in disbelief.

     Glancing sourly at the two women, as he and Moncrief
     enter.

     Speaking in hushed, and in Joan's case, urgent tones,
     while, in the b.g., Moncrief exits to the hallway.

     Andy looks over at RED, now seated in one of the two
     chairs in the room. Moncrief can be seen re-entering
     and joining him.

     Harry releases Sturge and moves over to Layls, offering
     his hand and trying to maintain his gruff manner:

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                  Mr. Layls...

     Joan looks with dismay at Harry's apostasy as he shakes
     "the great man's" hand, then quickly returns her atten-
     tion to Andy:

                  defective judgement in men, Joanie?

     Red and Harry, as before. In the b.g., a hospital
     employee wheels a cart holding several glasses of iced
     tea. Moncrief moves over to the cart and the employee
     exits.

<b>                                 HARRY

     As he seats himself in the other chair, Red reaches up
     and takes a glass of tea offered by Moncrief:

       him toward the van. On his way, he glances somberly
       over his shoulder at the house. In so doing his gaze
       falls on the ax embedded in the hood of the Mercedes. He
       stops and walks back to the car.
       Once again, he takes hold of the ax handle and makes
       several attempts to dislodge it. In a final Arthurian
       effort, the blade yields and he pulls the ax free. He
       suddenly steps back away from the car, as a steamy spray
       of hot radiator water spurts up from the gash in the top
       of the hood. Then he glances guiltily toward the house,

       wire travel kennel with another German shepherd inside.

                    He's green, but maybe you could do
                    something with him.
       He opens the cage and clips the leash to the dog's
       collar.

<b>                                  HARRY
</b>                    No, I don't want the dog.

       The shepherd jumps out to the ground, wagging his tail:

       the higher vantage point of the van, he has a clear view
       through the rear window of Eddy's Jeep and just before it

       toward Harry's van,   parked several yards behind Eddy's
       car and immediately   runs over to it.


<b>       ON VAN
</b>       She pulls open the door and addressing the dog inside,
       points toward Harry and Eddy:

</b>       A frantic free-for-all takes place on the precarious
       footing of the hillside, with Joan alternately pulling at
       one and pushing at the other. The intensity and violence
       of their struggle is such that she is knocked further
       down the incline. Harry, quickly glances down the hill
       to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow
       by Eddy, who breaks free and runs to his car.

       Harry pursues him, catching him as he tries to get into
       the car. He pushes him against the door and they begin
       battering each other with a series of punches.

       The SHEPHERD, wanting to join in the excitement, leaps
       about them, BARKING joyously. Then finding Eddy's
       sleeve, he takes it in his mouth and begins shaking it
       vigorously.

       Joan, her hair fretted   with twigs, climbs up over the
       edge of the hill. In    the b.g. behind her, a HELICOPTER
       APPROACHES. She looks    toward Harry and Eddy trading
       blows, then climbs up   the rest of the way, and as she
       gets to her feet, she   picks up a stone and throws it at
       them, yelling:

<b>                                  JOAN
</b>                    You bastards!!
       The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is
       bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing
       a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a
       series of invectives, at the lights of the city below,
       her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS.
       The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and
       an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above:
<b>                                  VOICE

                    What are you people doing down
                    there?

       Joan turns back to Harry. He holds the now unconscious
       Eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations,
       starts to move toward Joan:

<b>                                  HARRY

<b>127    EXT. ADELE'S BACK YARD - NIGHT                            127
</b>       MUSIC OVER: Adele in her shorts and halter top, attends
       the barbecue, a spatula in her hand. As though someone
       had just addressed her by her rightful name, she suddenly
       turns to look IN the CAMERA, and happy to be noticed, she
       lays the spatula down and begins to do a hula dance.

       MUSIC OVER: Sturge leans with his back against the
       Continental. Across from him is Eugene's van, and in
       through the window the green shepherd looks back at him
       with one of Eugene's socks dangling from his mouth.

       MUSIC OVER: Sturge lights a cigarette, then raises his
       eyes to see:
       Duke, leaping up onto the hood of Eugene's van. He lies
       down and lowers his head to rest on his paws. Then look-
       ing across at Sturge, he raises his lips in a soundless,
       disdainful growl.

       Eugene, arriving late. He moves    down the aisle searching
       for a seat. He has forgotten to    remove the training
       leash from his belt loop and the   tip of it hangs an inch
       or so below the hem of his sport   jacket.

      searching for him again and finding him, she smiles.


<b>      ON EUGENE

      emotion and an expression of undissembled and openly
      childlike delight takes shape upon his face.
