<b>               EXT. ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
               CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, 
               obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy 
               Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray 
               blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. 
               They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the 
               statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth 
               grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The 
               other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a 
               stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both 
               firmly by the shoulders.

<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
</b>                         Make one more move and you'll both 
                         be staying late for the rest of the 
                         week.

<b>                                     THE BOYS
</b>                              (softly; in unison)
                         Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.

<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
</b>                         I didn't hear you.

<b>                                     THE BOYS
</b>                              (louder)
                         Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.

               Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks 
               out past the parking lot gate.

               Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full 
               throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the 
               loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking 
               place around the corner.

<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
</b>                              (used to this)
                         Step away from the curb, children.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
               Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school 
               bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. 
               The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet 
               of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting 
               halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings 
               open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life 
               of the party, even when there isn't any party going on.

               While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the 
               only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a 
               driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his 
               capabilities and get serious in his next life... This 
               incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps 
               up to him.

<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
</b>                         You're late again, Rick.

<b>                                     RICK
</b>                         I know, Sister, but I have a very 
                         good excuse.

<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
</b>                         There can be no excuse for tardiness.

<b>                                     RICK
</b>                         You're absolutely right. I should 
                         never have stopped to save that 
                         drowning infant. I'm just weak, 
                         Sister; I'm so weak.

               He starts sobbing softly into his hands.

<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
</b>                         All right, stop that... Children, on 
                         the bus.

               The kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is 
               drying his tears with his handkerchief.

<b>                                     RICK
</b>                         Sister, do you ever get lonely after 
                         vespers? If you do, why don't you 
                         give me a call. I'm in the book.

<b>                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
</b>                              (smiling despite 
                              herself)
                         Get going, Rick... you're late enough 
                         as it is.

<b>                                     RICK
</b>                         Right... Think it over.

               He hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus 
               out of the parking lot.

<b>               INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
               As soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell 
               breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting 
               like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with 
               books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top 
               of their lungs.

<b>               ANGLE - RICK
</b>
               He removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard, 
               revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches 
               the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the 
               P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order.

<b>                                     RICK
</b>                              (over mike)
                         If you don't all calm down I'm gonna 
                         drive this thing over a cliff.

               The kids pay no attention to him.

<b>                                     RICK
</b>                              (continuing; 
                              philosophically)
                         Ah... youth.

<b>               EXT. THE BUS
</b>
               Rick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled 
               with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it. 
               The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his 
               engine. Rick counters by gunning his.

<b>               INT. THE BUS
</b>
               All the kids start screaming "Race... race." "Wipe 'em out." 
               "Go for it." Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out 
               money and start betting one another on the race's outcome.

<b>               ANGLE - RICK
</b>
               as he readies for action.

<b>               EXT. THE BUSES
</b>
               The light turns green and they're off. Or as off as two lunky 
               school buses filled with kids can be.

<b>               WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREET
</b>
               The two buses come zooming down the street.

<b>               INT. RICK'S BUS
</b>
               The kids are screaming at Rick to go faster. One of the little 
               boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him.

<b>               EXT. THE STREET - LOW ANGLE
</b>
               The buses squeeze down a narrow street, neck and neck with 
               one another.

<b>               INT. THE BUS
</b>
               The kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick, who 
               is hunched over in his seat, driving with the determination 
               of Andy Granitelli. The nauseous kid is now turning a pale 
               shade of green. He moves to an open window, straining to 
               control the inevitable.

<b>               EXT. THE BUSES
</b>
               They race down a steep hill.

<b>               INT. THE BUS
</b>
               The nauseous kid can't hold it any longer.

<b>               EXT. THE OTHER BUS
</b>
               Something hits with a splat against the windshield that 
               resembles Campbell's Chunky Vegetable Soup.

<b>               INT. THE OTHER BUS
</b>
               The other Driver turns on the windshield. It only makes it 
               worse.

<b>               EXT. THE STREET
</b>
               Rick's bus pulls out in front, accompanied by the cheering 
               of his passengers. Suddenly a stop light looms ahead. Rick 
               puts on his brakes. Both buses stop just in time.

<b>               INT. RICK'S BUS
</b>
               Rick's kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the 
               front of the bus. Although disheveled, the kids still manage 
               a victorious cheer.

<b>               PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV
</b>
               We're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one-
               year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR 
               the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears.

<b>                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
</b>                         Okay, Timmy... hold that smile... 
                         and watch the birdie.

               He takes the picture and we SEE the camera flash.

<b>                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
</b>                         There.

<b>               O'NEILL
</b>
               We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera 
               department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest 
               of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest 
               and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But 
               under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's 
               best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the 
               camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering 
               up her baby.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                         These should be in the mail to you 
                         by next Friday.

               She smiles and exits.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                              (continuing)
                         Next.

               A beautiful -- and we're talking gorgeous -- WOMAN enters. 
               Her clothes hug every curve of her body. She has her baby in 
               her arms. O'Neill immediately wants her, and now. His eyes 
               settle onto her full breasts. These he likes.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                              (continuing)
                         Whoa. Look at those babies.

               She gets this innuendo and loves it.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                              (continuing)
                         How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. 
                         And you are...?

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Klupner.
                              (teasing)
                         Mrs. Klupner.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                         Mrs.?

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         I'm separated.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                         Then there is a God. Why don't we 
                         take that baby picture.

               He takes the baby. He has a hard time taking his eyes off 
               her breasts. He places the baby on the blanket.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                              (continuing)
                         If I were you, I'd breast feed until 
                         I was 17 or 18.
                              (gets behind camera; 
                              sizing up the shot)
                         Tell ya what...

<b>               O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH CAMERA
</b>
               We SEE the baby sitting on the blanket.

<b>                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
</b>                         Why don't you lean into the picture 
                         with your child?

               She coyly leans INTO FRAME.

<b>                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
</b>                              (continuing)
                         A-huh. A little more... good!

               She is totally blocking her baby out of the picture.

<b>               O'NEILL
</b>
               He gets out from behind the camera.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                         I'm getting one heck of a glare off 
                         your dress there. Could you undo a 
                         few buttons?

<b>                                     WOMAN

                         Of course.

               She starts to unbutton her blouse. O'Neill looks into his 
               camera.

<b>               O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH LENS
</b>
               We SEE the Woman finish her last button.

<b>                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
</b>                         Now lean in a little more... more... 
                         more...

               As she complies, her breasts all but spill out of her dress.

<b>                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
</b>                              (continuing)
                         Hold that pose.

<b>               O'NEILL
</b>
               He runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman.

<b>               THROUGH CAMERA LENS
</b>
               We SEE a QUICK SERIES of camera flashes. Each pose finds him 
               near her breasts. He has them on his head. He's cheek to 
               breast. Etc.

<b>               RICK
</b>
               enters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps 
               into the shots.

<b>               THROUGH CAMERA LENS
</b>
               Rick joins the craziness. After several beats, the Woman 
               gets bored and EXITS the FRAME.

<b>               THE WOMAN
</b>
               As Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds 
               in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few 
               beats pass and the guys notice they're alone.

               Rick's school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop. 
               Several Chicanos are working on various cars. Rick and O'Neill

               We SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under 
               the chassis. Slowly, a large, bear-like body rolls out and 
               we catch our first glimpse of CHULO. A happy-go-lucky mechanic 
               of Mexican ancestry.

                         will you?

               A SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind 
               them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot.

               Another MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes 
               his head. Just then Raul, the eye-patched worker, whizzes by 
               behind the guys, driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right 
               into traffic.

               Behind them we can SEE Roberto fiddling with the lighter. 
               Suddenly flames leap out of the car, blowing Roberto ten

               The guys all start to pile into the bus. Nearby another 
               employee is washing down the garage with a hose.

               Chulo turns to another mechanic, who has his head under the 
               hood of a car.

               Manuel waves at Chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. Rick starts 
               it up and starts to drive away. Just as the bus CLEARS FRAME, 
               we SEE Manuel connect two wires together at the same moment 
               the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet. 
               Manuel lights up like a Christmas tree, screaming in pain. 
               There is a beat, and then Robert falls INTO FRAME, still 
               holding the cigarette lighter, and the car Raul is driving 
               enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.

               A sign on an office door says "CONCERT TICKET AGENCY." From 
               inside we HEAR someone TALKING loudly on the phone. Chulo, 
               Rick and O'Neill open the door and go inside. On the walls 
               in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters 
               advertising rock bands like Men At Work, The Clash and Barry 
               Manilow. Behind a cluttered desk we FIND a little man with a 
               thin mustache and horn-rimmed glasses. This is GARY MELNITZ, 
               wheeler-dealer, entrepreneur and coward. Gary yells a lot, 
               which is a definite overcompensation for his size and 
               inability to deal with the opposite sex.

<b>               EXT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY

               We SEE a couple of very contemporary looking 15-year-olds 
               going into a very "now" clothing store -- like Fred Segal's... 
               When the door opens, loud ROCK 'N ROLL MUSIC blasts out.

               Inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving 
               narcissistically to the music like they're at a disco. The 
               cashier, PHOEBE, has devoted her life to following the current 
               trends and fads no matter how inane they may be. Today she's 
               in a reggae mode, her hair wound into tight dreadlocks, as 
               she sways lost in the ozone to the music. A CUSTOMER 
               approaches her with a purchase.

                         this song is over.

               She floats off again...

               One of the young MALE CUSTOMERS approaches an attractive 
               salesgirl. This is DEBBIE THOMERSON, Rick's intended. She 
               seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's 
               actually working, putting clothes on the racks. This 
               impression of sanity fits her, as she is level-headed, and 
               has a clear sense of herself. She can also take a joke, thus 
               her engagement to Rick.

               She leads the Customer to the try-on booths. The Customer 
               enters one. We SEE that the saloon-style doors of the booths 
               have been hung too high, so as he takes off his pants, his 
               underwear is exposed to the world. We PULL BACK, REVEALING 
               other people in other booths, their bare asses clearly in 
               sight. No one in the store seems to care, however, as they 
               are much too busy dancing.

               The front door opens and BOBBIE, a very sultry and earthy-
               looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside. She is 
               O'Neill's girl and Debbie's best friend... She's also someone 
               who would party every night if given half a chance.

               The girls screech and jump around, hugging each other in 
               sheer joy. A MALE CUSTOMER, moved by this outpouring of 
               affection, moves over and gets in the middle of the girls, 
               enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once.

               Rick is cooking dinner in the cramped combination kitchen / 
               living room. He has about five dishes going at once as he 
               dashes from stove to refrigerator. He grabs some hamburger 
               meat, rolls it into a ball, then slaps it on the counter. He 
               then takes a steam iron and presses it on the patty.

               Debbie comes in the front door and crosses to him and hugs 
               him tightly, kissing him sweetly.

</b>
               Through the iron gates of an impressive-looking estate comes 
               Debbie in her convertible VW Rabbit. She pulls up behind a 
               new Porsche 911 and a Jeep, all decked out with rifles, nets 
               and other hunting equipment. As she walks down the path toward 
               the house, she sees something off in the distance that 
               startles her.

</b>
               A large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side 
               door of the house.

               The "Bear" turns around. We SEE that the bear is, in fact, 
               dead. It is being carried by a tall, handsome HUNTER. He 
               waves to Debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside.

<b>               INT. COLE'S SMOKEHOUSE - DAY

               Debbie opens a rustic-looking door and peers in.

               CAMERA PANS WITH Debbie as she enters the room. She passes 
               several trophies, guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from 
               the wall. She makes her way past some sections of an 
               undetermined animal's anatomy hanging from hooks suspended 
               from the ceiling. Finally we see COLE WHITTIER, a Steve Garvey 
               look-alike... rugged all-American, and heir to the Whittier 
               Plastic Wrap fortune. Despite his jockish good looks and 
               outward arrogance, there's something in his manner that is 
               definitely unsavory.

               As Debbie approaches him we SEE that he is butchering some 
               unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of 
               him. (NOTE: For the squeamish, all of this is done OUT OF

               Cole stops what he is doing for a beat and just stares at

               Rick and Mr. Thomerson are having a heart to heart chat over 
               some lemonade in front of the tennis court.

</b>                         Well, I have to admit my game's a 
                         little rusty, but I love polo. It's 
                         unrelenting, a constant challenge to 
                         the senses. Really a beautiful 
                         experience.

                         Good. I think you're an asshole. No, 
                         let me correct that, an immature 
                         asshole. Which is fine, except you're 
                         marrying my daughter and I'm afraid 
                         my grandchildren are going to be

                         She can do what she wants. But if 
                         you want your marriage to last, you're 
                         going to have to change some things 
                         about yourself. If I may make some 
                         suggestions...

               As Mr. Thomerson drones on, Rick shifts uncomfortably in his 
               chair, focusing his attention on Debbie, her mother and her 
               older, cynical cousin, ILENE, who are sitting nearby on the

               Mr. Thomerson rolls his eyes, knowing he's been wasting his 
               breath. He grabs the pitcher of lemonade and Rick grabs the 
               tray, which is filled with fresh lemons. They get up at the 
               same time and collide, sending the lemonade all over Mr. T., 
               and the lemons bounding over the fence.

               They kiss, and the guys whistle in the background. Then Debbie 
               starts toward the house and Rick hops back into the bus. He 
               gets into the seat and sits there for a moment, watching 
               Debbie with a guilty look as she goes into the house.

               The guys holler and whoop it up as Rick puts the bus in gear 
               and takes off down the street.

               JUMBO, a well-dressed behemoth in a sky blue suit and

               Gary.

               Gary takes out a roll of bills, which Jumbo grabs and quickly 
               counts.

                         Margot... Darlene...

               Two shapely HOOKERS in tight-fitting clothes come up to them.

                         Look, after the orgy, maybe we could 
                         have coffee.

               The girls look at him with "Is he for real?" in their eyes.

               Gary takes some slips of paper out of his pocket and hands 
               Jumbo one.

               Gary turns, almost collides with a garbage can, and starts 
               walking down the street. He passes a parked Porsche. After a 
               beat, Cole Whittier sticks his head up and watches Gary walk 
               off. Then he hops out of his car and approaches Jumbo and 
               the girls.

                         What about it.

               Cole's face lights up. This is the information he needed.

                         our minds and decided to send the 
                         girls over to his house instead.

               He takes out a fifty-dollar bill.

               Cole smiles happily as he slithers back to his car.

               A parking VALET crosses to the bus as Rick hands him the 
               keys.

               The guys hop out with the enthusiasm of a home team that's 
               just won the state championship. They race in the front door. 
               A banner over the door reads: "WELCOME MISS MOOSEHEAD BEER

               This is a pretty plush place. The kind of hotel that prides 
               itself on its classy image. The guys are totally unaware of 
               the sedate atmosphere in the lobby as they go screaming toward 
               the elevators.

               Just as they are about to get into the elevator, a hand comes 
               INTO FRAME and holds the door so it will not close.

               WIDEN TO INCLUDE the MANAGER. All their carrying-on stops 
               when the guys see him staring grimly at them. If he wasn't a 
               hotel manager, he'd be a mortician. He has a constant 
               expression on his face that suggests he's constantly sucking

               The PIMP turns around and we SEE he is the stereotypical 
               pimp. One big difference: he's an Indian straight from the 
               streets of Calcutta. He's soft-spoken and ever smiling and 
               he still hasn't quite mastered English.

               MILT joins them. Milt is a massive hulk. A bearded exbiker.

               Rick, O'Neill, Ryko and Stan come back into the room.

               Larry is on his knees on the side of the tub with his head 
               submerged fully under several inches of water.

               Larry comes out of the water. He gasps for breath and speaks.

               He takes a deep breath and submerges his head again. Rick 
               unplugs the tub and it begins to drain.

               The water has drained from the tub, leaving Larry high and 
               dry. He lifts his head out of the tub. In his state, he's 
               unaware that the water is gone. He gasps for air as Rick 
               holds him up.

                         everything here... now.

               Larry takes a deep breath and plunges his head into the tub. 
               His head hits the waterless tub bottom with a loud THUD. He 
               goes limp from the concussion. His body drapes into the tub, 
               head first.

               Larry gets up and exits the room. PUSH IN ON Rick. He looks 
               after Larry, concerned.

               Waiter acknowledges he's got it and exits. O'Neill joins 
               Rick.

</b>                         Let's sit down.

               O'Neill leads Rick to the table the Bellhop pointed out. 
               They sit down. Immediately O'Neill takes some cash from his 
               pocket and holds it under the table.

</b>
               Huddled underneath the table, hidden by the tablecloth, is a 
               HOOKER. Her specialty is coming right up. She grabs the bills 
               from O'Neill's hand. She tucks the money in her cleavage and 
               turns her talents to Rick. She unzips his fly.

               The Hooker has begun to do what she does best. And Rick loves 
               it.

               to them.

               Rick tries to maintain his dignity. But from under the table 
               a blue ribbon job is being applied to his fun zone.

               Falwell shakes Rick's hand. Rick hangs on for dear life. 
               Pumping the hand up and down at a faster and faster rate.

               Father Falwell looks on rather perplexed. Rick sees Falwell's 
               puzzled look.

               Before Rick can speak we HEAR a VOICE from under the table.

</b>                         Not yet.

               Rick's hand EXITS FRAME and zips up his pants. Then Rick and 
               O'Neill get up.

               O'Neill can't believe what Rick is about to do.

</b>                         Yes. Thank you.

               He sits in Rick's spot. Rick leans on the table to say his 
               final farewell to the priest. He takes this moment to get 
               some money out of his pocket and hold it under the table.

               He and Rick, suppressing a laugh, exit. Father Falwell picks 
               up the menu. We HEAR the ZIP SOUND. Father perks up. He 
               doesn't know what the hell is happening.

               O'Neill turns to Rick as they're leaving the coffee shop.

               Everyone cheers Stan's good fortune. Kelley takes Stan by 
               the hand and leads him into the bedroom. Gary turns on a 
               record and everyone starts dancing. Larry is laying out drugs 
               on a table. They consist of lines of coke and various happy 
               time pills of all colors and shapes. Rick takes a look at

               around in her bra and underwear. Chulo wants her.

                         You! Mine!

               Laverne is frightened of Chulo. Mainly because he's coming 
               at her like a sex-starved buffalo. Chulo goes after her. 
               Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door. Chulo 
               gives chase.

               their bathing suits. Chulo stops short of running on stage.

                         The second month things calm down a 
                         little. By the third month you're 
                         looking through your old girlfriends' 
                         phone numbers; by the fourth month 
                         you're numb; by the fifth month, 
                         hopefully the football season starts.

               Stan pats Rick on the back and dives into the festivities.

               He spots someone across the room. It's like Tony spotting 
               Maria for the first time in "West Side Story." As in a DREAM 
               SEQUENCE, ALL SOUNDS STOP. Two pinspots hit them. She turns 
               and sees him. She smiles. Both are madly in love. Like two 
               pieces of metal attracted to the same magnet, they walk toward 
               each other.

               They take each other by the hand. They walk into the bedroom 
               and close the door behind them.

               his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage. 
               WIDEN as he looks down at his right wrist.

               He heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor

               As he shoves Larry out, Gary enters the bathroom. His 
               expression tells us he's had the best sex of his life.

               Gary's "woman" enters and closes the door. Their eyes meet. 
               Gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. She turns away, 
               then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds 
               to pee. She is a man. Gary is stunned. His jaw drops open. 
               Gary's dream girl/guy finishes his business. He drops his 
               dress and turns to Gary.

               Tim exits. Gary feels filthy. He rips open the cabinet, takes 
               out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his 
               teeth. He rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and 
               scrubs as if he's scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat.

               Rick is shaken by this. He shakes his head and wipes at his

               Rajah's head. He looks at the arrow and realizes he almost 
               was killed.

                         haul ass.

               He runs out of the room. Rick and O'Neill watch Rajah exit, 
               confused.

               Just then another arrow comes zipping through the room, 
               lodging in a chair inches from Rick.

               They turn in the direction the arrow came from and look out 
               the window. They spot Cole loading his bow in the room across 
               the way.

               Chulo is waiting outside a door that says "Dressing Room." 
               Several of the beauty contestants race out wearing formal 
               gowns. Laverne follows them, wearing a very tight black dress. 
               Chulo approaches her.

               Laverne is moved by this. Before she can respond a Stage 
               Manager takes her by the arm and pushes her on stage.

               He looks through his cards hurriedly and is unable to find

</b>                         That's a good question. From the way 
                         I understand it, according to supply 
                         side economics, when supply exceeds 
                         demand, recession is the result. 
                         That's why I think we should control 
                         the credit markets and increase the 
                         prime rate. That way, the consumer 
                         price index will stabilize and we

               Debbie, her mother and the girls enter the lobby. They 
               approach the Hotel Manager, who is standing behind the front 
               desk. They are dressed garishly, like hookers. Debbie has on 
               a cheap blonde wig and mini skirt. The Manager looks at them 
               the way one would look at an approaching plague.

               The girls turn and start toward the elevator. Mrs. Thomerson, 
               who is wearing the kind of push-up bra that makes her tits 
               look like the Black Hills, smiles at the Manager seductively. 
               He smiles back, then catches himself.

                         Those guys are asking for it.

               The girls cross to the elevator. Ilene pushes the button and 
               the doors swing open. They get inside and just before the 
               doors close, a huge behemoth of a man joins them inside. He 
               turns and faces CAMERA. It's Milt, Rajah's beefy helper. He 
               doesn't look happy as he eyes the girls. They look back at 
               him uncomfortably as the doors slam shut.

<b>               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

               The elevator door opens. Milt has all the girls by the collar 
               and hustles them down the hall.

               Milt stops at a door and kicks it with his foot. The door 
               opens a crack at first, then swings open wide, revealing six 
               middle-aged Japanese business MEN in their underwear. They 
               smile wide at the girls, obviously thrilled with the quality 
               of the merchandise delivered to them. Milt shoves them into 
               the room.

               They turn toward the door. One of the Japanese races over 
               and gets there first, slamming and bolting the door shut.

               The girls run around the room in a panic with the Japanese 
               chasing them in very hot pursuit.

               flying around the room, then the SOUND of his pant ZIPPER

               The guys have tied the sheets and blankets together and made 
               a rope. The other end is tied around Cole's chest. And that's 
               all Cole is wearing; he's nude.

               He and O'Neill lift Cole up and put him out the window. They 
               hang onto the sheet/blanket rope and lower him slowly outside.

               We SEE that Cole's weight is pulling the bed to the window.

<b>               COLE
</b>
               He's slowly lowering down the side of the building.

<b>               INT. ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM
</b>
               A YOUNG COUPLE enters the room. They are very much in love. 
               He gives her a kiss and closes the door.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Why don't you get comfortable?

               She smiles coyly and starts to undress. He crosses to the 
               closed blinds.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                              (continuing)
                         There's a wonderful moon out tonight.

               He opens the blinds, revealing Cole's ass pressed up against 
               the window.

<b>               WOMAN
</b>
               She screams, horrified.

<b>               INT. JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN'S ROOM
</b>
               The girls are being hotly pursued by the Japanese men.

                         sushi, doesn't it?

<b>               INT. COLE'S ROOM
</b>
               The bed moves right up against the wall under the window. We 
               SEE the end tied to the bed post is beginning to untie.

<b>               COLE
</b>
               He's panicked.

<b>               INT. COLE'S ROOM
</b>
               The knot unties.

<b>               COLE
</b>
               He falls OUT OF FRAME. The "rope" trailing behind.

<b>               INT. CAR
</b>
               The young couple from the room are seated in his sportscar. 
               He's cranking open the sun roof.

</b>                         Babe, I didn't know anything about 
                         that.

               The sun roof opens. Suddenly Cole's ass sticks through it. 
               The Woman freaks out again.

<b>               EXT. SPORTSCAR
</b>
               We SEE a groggy Cole sitting in the sun roof. The Man in the 
               car is trying to calm down his lady.

<b>               INT. BANQUET ROOM - BACKSTAGE
</b>
               Chulo and Laverne are standing in the wings while in the 
               b.g. we can SEE the MC singing the Moosehead Beer jingle. 
               Then:

               Laverne and the five finalists go out on stage.

<b>               ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON

               He gives an envelope to the MC.

</b>
               They are all nervous, especially Laverne.

</b>                         Laverne Rivas.

               Laverne squeals with delight and hugs the MC as he puts the 
               bejeweled crown on her head. Then the MC leads her to the 
               microphone.

<b>                                     LAVERNE
</b>                              (teary-eyed)
                         I can't believe it. This is the 
                         happiest day of my life, and I owe 
                         it all to him.

               She points O.S. to Chulo, Chulo, with tears in his eyes, 
               comes out on stage and, in a surge of emotion, picks Laverne 
               up off her feet and hugs her passionately.

</b>                         I know I've had that girl.

</b>                              (looking at Chulo)
                         And I know that guy from somewhere, 
                         too.

               The other judge looks at Mr. Thomerson suspiciously.

</b>
               CAMERA PUSHES IN TO a car in the parking lot which is towing 
               a U-Haul trailer behind it. The car stops and turns off its 
               lights.

<b>               INT. CAR

               Stan and O'Neill sit in the car looking at the hotel.

</b>                         How the hell are we supposed to get

                         I'd love to get you in an operating 
                         room. Just once.

<b>               ANGLE - HOTEL ENTRANCE
</b>
               Just then the "Moose" from the beauty pageant steps outside 
               the hotel for a smoke.

               The guy in front removes the head, takes a drag of his 
               cigarette and passes it to the guy bringing up the rear. 
               After a beat, smoke steams out the rear end of the costume.

<b>               ANGLE - THE GUYS IN THE CAR
</b>
               They both have the same idea. They stroll out of the car and 
               approach the two men in the moose suit. We can't hear what 
               they're saying, but we can SEE the bills Stan is taking out 
               of his pocket. Ryko grabs the moosehead and runs over to the 
               trailer with it.

<b>               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
               The door opens and Stan and Ryko enter pulling the "Moose" 
               by a rope.

<b>                                     RYKO
</b>                         Can you believe how perfect it fits?

</b>                         Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both 
                         be a size 138 regular.

               Just then Rick and O'Neill saunter into the lobby.

<b>                                     O'NEILL

                         Oh... it's... er... the guys from 
                         the beer convention. We're bringing 
                         them to the party.

<b>                                     RICK
</b>                         Great.
                              (to moose)
                         I was wondering, how do you guys go 
                         to the bathroom in that thing?

               At that moment he HEARS a SPLAT hit the ground. The guys 
               look down and see a large, shiny clump of shiny brown 
               excrement nestled in the shag carpet.

<b>                                     RICK
</b>                              (continuing)
                         Say no more.

               The Manager crosses to them.

<b>                                     MANAGER
</b>                         I don't know which one of you did 
                         this, but you're not going anywhere 
                         till you clean up this disgusting 
                         mess.

<b>                                     O'NEILL
</b>                              (resigned)
                         Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel 
                         or something?

               All the guests turn away in disgust. Stan takes out a 
               handkerchief and hands it to Rick, who closes his eyes and 
               picks up the warm little bundle. The Manager turns and walks 
               off in a huff. On the way back to the elevator, Rick checks 
               to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's 
               contents on the front desk, just OUT OF FRAME. Smiling 
               contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant "moose" into the 
               elevator. The doors slam shut.

<b>               ANGLE AT THE DESK

               The Manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out 
               of town.

</b>                         I'll have the boy take your bags up.

               He goes to hit the bell and to his surprise, his hand comes 
               down on something soft and mushy. The look on his face tells 
               us what it is. It's the "gift" Rick left behind.

<b>                                     MANAGER
</b>                              (to couple)
                         Excuse me. I seem to have a hand 
                         full of potty.

               Revolted, he races into a room marked "MEN."

               The doors open and several people from the Moosehead beauty 
               pageant come out. Mr. Thomerson is one of them.

               Mr. T. crosses to the door just as Cole comes running in, 
               slightly dazed, wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet 
               that held him suspended out the window. They both are shocked 
               to see one another.

                         made me get naked. They hung me from 
                         the window so high up it was so scary

               O'Neill lifts the head off the moose costume, revealing a 
               real burro. The burro shows all his teeth as burros are apt 
               to do when excited. O'Neill and Stan zip off the rest of his

                         The very lovely, Miss Desiree...

               DESIREE, an erotic, tall woman wearing a leather face mask, 
               comes out of the bedroom carrying a long whip. Desiree puts 
               Ravel's "Bolero" on the PHONOGRAPH; then she starts to sway 
               her hips sensuously in front of the animal.

               It is getting bored and a little hungry. It bends its head 
               to the left and spots the table with food on it. It bends 
               over and starts munching on some cole slaw.

               It's had enough cole slaw. Now it sniffs at Larry's drug 
               smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills. Next it 
               sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in 
               one gigantic sniff.

               She lets her long, flowing hair hang down over her breasts. 
               Then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor. She rolls 
               on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees.

<b>               ANGLE - HER AUDIENCE
</b>
               Rick can't believe he's seeing this. The other guys are 
               screaming at the top of their lungs. Even Larry seems spell-
               bound.

               It doesn't look so hot as it finishes off every drug on the

               She moves over to the donkey, hits him on the side gently 
               with her whip, then pulls him over to her mattress. The 
               donkey's blood-shot eyes are the size of saucers. Once again 
               he shows his teeth in a kind of shit-eating grin. Desiree 
               drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her. Mike 
               the Donkey obediently does as he's told, moving to her in a 
               trance-like, very turned-on state.

               The Donkey takes another step forward, and then suddenly 
               rears up on his hind legs, snorting. He starts bucking wildly. 
               The crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk 
               for a few seconds, then without warning collapses in a heap 
               on the floor.

               Everyone goes rushing up to it.

               Chulo and Laverne enter the room, followed by several of the 
               other contestants and others from the beauty pageant.

               Gary shushes him. We PUSH IN ON Dr. Stan, who is listening 
               for signs of life in the animal's chest. Finally Stan stands 
               up somberly.

               O'Neil places the moosehead on the donkey as Rick, Gary, 
               Chulo and Stan pull the donkey out into the hall like

               time to sneak into the suite right behind them.

               Mr. Thomerson can't believe the goings-on. People are making

               O'Neill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone. He pours the 
               bag of cocaine into the phone. He then screws the mouthpiece 
               back on over this mound of powder. Satisfied with his work,

               Mr. Thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. As he 
               does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. He 
               screams at Rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he 
               dials. Each move produces a large cloud of powder, which 
               causes him to sniffle slightly.

               He starts to react from inhaling the powder. He puts the 
               receiver to his ear. He takes a deep breath and tries to 
               dial another number. A large cloud of coke flies up his nose. 
               He's stunned. He takes another deep drag. He's hooked. He 
               forgets all about dialing. He jams the receiver against his 
               nose and takes deep drag after deep drag.

               Desiree, still wearing her leather mask, crosses to him and 
               sits down next to him on the bed. He gives her a big, wide 
               smile.

               She is surprised by the masses of humanity rubbing shoulders 
               with one another in the room.

               O'Neill looks over from the other side of the room and spots 
               her. He isn't fooled for a minute by her wig and mini skirt. 
               He runs over to Rick.

               Rick opens the door from the bathroom. The lights are turned 
               off and from the flashing illumination of a neon sign outside 
               the window we can MAKE OUT the outline of Debbie's body on 
               the bed.

               Debbie, in a disguised Southern accent, speaks out.

               Rick starts to undress. While undressing, he takes on the 
               persona of Mr. Rodgers. He sings Rodgers' opening theme in 
               that same sappy, child-like manner of his.

               He jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately. 
               Debbie snaps on the lights. She throws off her wig and she

               As Rick protests, she throws on her blouse and runs out of

               Just then Desiree and Mr. Thomerson cross THROUGH FRAME. 
               She's leading him around by the silver chain, which is now 
               attached to his neck. She's also carrying a leather whip.

               Rick and Debbie enter. To their surprise they find a man 
               wearing a leather mask tied to the bed and happily licking 
               Desiree's boots, which she dangles in front of him. She also 
               holds a whip over his head. Despite the mask, there is 
               something very familiar about his face, and the white powder 
               encrusted all over his nose.

               Debbie picks up on this immediately.

               Sure enough, Mr. Thomerson looks up and grimaces, knowing 
               he's been caught with his bondage down. He tries to say 
               something, but the boot in his mouth prevents anything

               by Rick, Debbie, Mr. Thomerson, Rick's gang, other guests 
               and assorted hookers. They run down the stairs. The cops

               As Cole rounds a corner, a tire comes loose and rolls off 
               the car -- thanks to Chulo's shoddy workmanship.

               He looks to the rear and sees Rick's bus not far behind them. 
               Suddenly he spots something O.S. He grabs Debbie and runs 
<b>               OUT OF FRAME.
</b>
<b>               EXT. CITY STREET
</b>
               A city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center 
               of the street. A man in the back of the truck is leisurely 
               placing orange cones in the center line of the road.

               Cole, with Debbie in tow, grabs the truck's DRIVER and hauls 
               him out of his seat. He then places Debbie inside the truck 
               and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones 
               in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing 
               the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting 
               speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up. 
               He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed.

<b>               INT. RICK'S BUS
</b>
               Rick, is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over.

               Our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted.

<b>               EXT. HIGHWAY
</b>
               Rick is in pursuit, knocking over cones. He's almost caught 
               up with Cole.

<b>               EXT. STREET
</b>
               The vehicles reach the top of the hill. Cole grabs a sharp 
               left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot. The maneuver 
               loses Rick for a second. Rick jams on the brakes and doubles 
               back into the parking lot.

<b>               EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT
</b>
               Cole pulls up with a SCREECH in front of the theater. He 
               grabs Debbie and jumps out of the truck. He drags her into 
               the theater entrance.

               Rick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out 
               of the bus.

                         theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. 
                         Fourteen movie theaters under one 
                         roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: 
                         "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags 
                         Debbie into one of the theaters. The 
                         gang runs up to the theaters.

</b>                         Fan out and look for them.

               They all go running into various theaters.

<b>               ANGLE - RYKO

               He approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie 
               playing inside.

</b>                         Aw, I've seen this one already.

               Rick chooses a theater and goes inside.

<b>               INT. MOVIE THEATER
</b>
               The patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action 
               on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman 
               arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to 
               the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters. 
               He gives chase and catches up with Cole.

               He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them 
               on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman.

               A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly 
               watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is 
               in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole 
               with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie 
               patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the 
               film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The 
               punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth.

                         them.

               Rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel Cole. 
               Cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit Rick with it. 
               Cole runs out of the aisle as Rick climbs over people and 
               dives onto Cole, knocking him to the aisle.

                         Best 3D I've ever seen.

               As the movie ends, Rick has Cole by the collar and is dragging 
               him out of the theater.

<b>               INT. MALL OUTSIDE THEATER

               Rick exits the theater with Cole. He tosses Cole to Chulo. 
               Debbie comes running behind Rick.

                         a thought. Why don't we go home and

               The Patrons are exiting. All of them are very up and excited 
               by their 3D experience.

</b>
               It's another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean. 
               Just right for Rick and Debbie's wedding. We SEE the wedding 
               in progress. The area is adorned with flowers.

               The many guests are seated and taken in the moment. Among 
               these are Tracey, Desiree and Gary's she-man, who waves to 
               Gary as he stands with the other ushers, Chulo, Ryko and 
               Larry. Chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears. He 
               looks over at Laverne, who smiles to him.

               Nearby stand the maids of honor, Bobbie, Phoebie and Ilene, 
               who blows a kiss to her date, Ray (one of the Japanese 
               businessmen).

               The Thomersons sit in the front row. Neither of them is 
               cherishing this moment.

                         But... at least we'll have grandkids.

               They sort of smile at each other at the thought.

               Father Falwell is almost through with the ceremony. A car 
               pulls up in the b.g. Exiting the car is Stan and a WOMAN. 
               O'Neill, the best man, sees the car. He pokes Rick. He 
               indicates to Rick someone has arrived.

<b>               STAN
</b>
               We SEE the man in the car is Stan. He ushers the lady in the 
               car to Larry. He's surprised at who she is: his wife.

                         in fast over the ocean. The wind
