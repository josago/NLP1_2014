                                      July 15, 1991

</b>
<b>               EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --
</b>
               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable 
               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very 
               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, 
               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible 
               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT 
               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding 
               a rifle and staring straight out.

               The drum cadence has been building slightly.

               A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight 
               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
               the distance.

               We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

               where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, 
               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop 
               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still 
               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into

<b>               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
               his bunk.

               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S 
               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks 
               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out 
               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
               and professionalism.

               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto 
               his mouth and eyes --

               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking 
               him, just holding his head still --

               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four

               and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper 
               Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a 
               sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
               silver and brass.

               The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
               before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

               As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from 
               various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. 
               Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were 
               all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same 
               fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM 
               that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.

               The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 
               30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
               to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her 
               JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...

                         over the weekend down in Cuba.

</b>                         Yes sir... This past Friday evening.  
                         Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
                         and Private Louden Downey, entered 
                         the barracks room of a PFC William 
                         Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
                         died at the base hospital 
                         approximately an hour later. The NIS 
                         agent who took their statements 
                         maintains they were trying to prevent 
                         Santiago from naming them in a 
                         fenceline shooting incident. They're 
                         scheduled to have a hearing down in 
                         Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.

</b>                         Dawson and Downey are both recruiting 
                         poster marines and Santiago was known 
                         to be a screw-up. I was thinking 
                         that it sounded an awful lot like a 
                         code red.

               Jo lets this sink in a moment.

                         and assigned counsel. Someone who 
                         can really look into this. Someone 
                         who possesses not only the legal 
                         skill, but a familiarity with the 
                         inner workings of the military. In 
                         short, Captain, I'd like to suggest 
                         that... I be the one who, that it be 
                         me who is assigned to represent them.

               he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread 
               out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 
               Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own 
               against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.

               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law 
               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous 
               spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, 
               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

               He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right 
               between his legs.

               of SHERBY's glove and into center field.

                         Cuba and to ask for your help. I've

                         a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant 
                         grabbed me and pushed me down the 
                         hill. Then I saw all black and the 
                         last thing I remember is hitting the 
                         deck. I was brought to the hospital 
                         where I was told I just had heat 
                         exhaustion and was explained to by 
                         the doctor that my body has trouble 
                         with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. 
                         I ask you to help me. Please sir. I

               JESSEP's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one 
               of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps. He's smart as a

               He's talking to his two senior officers. CAPTAIN MARKINSON 
               is in his late 40's. He's a career marine and a nice guy in 
               a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure 
               as shit don't finish first. Lt. JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK is 
               26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate.

               He tosses the letter over to MARKINSON. MARKINSON is looking 
               it over. JESSEP is waiting for a response.

                         train Santiago. Maybe we as officers

                         where he is. We're gonna train the 
                         lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago 
                         doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness 
                         report, I'm gonna blame you. Then

                         Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston 
                         Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel 
                         Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate 
                         and Attorney General, of the United 
                         States, died 1985. You went to Harvard 
                         Law on a Navy scholarship, probably 
                         because that's what your father wanted 
                         you to do, and now you're just 
                         treading water for the three years 
                         you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, 
                         just kinda layin' low til you can 
                         get out and get a real job. And if 
                         that's the situation, that's fine, I 
                         won't tell anyone. But my feeling is 
                         that if this case is handled in the 
                         same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian 
                         Bazaar manner with which you seem to 
                         handle everything else, something's 
                         gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be 
                         doing my job if I allowed Dawson and 
                         Downey to spend any more time in 
                         prison than absolutely necessary, 
                         because their attorney had pre-
                         determined the path of least 
                         resistance.

               stair unit is brought up.

               HOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the 
               passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS, 
               a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and 
               SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis.

               KAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in 
               Kansas anymore.

               HOWARD shouts over the noise from the planes.

               JESSEP, MARKINSON, KENDRICK and the LAWYERS are seated at a 
               table in the corner.

               finishing a story.

                         hours running around, looking for 
                         Americans to surrender to.

               JESSEP laughs. KENDRICK joins him. SAM and KAFFEE force a 
               laugh.

               MARKINSON forces a smile. JO remains silent.

               Here's something else KAFFEE didn't know. Neither did Jo. 
               SAM jots something down on a small notepad.

               MARKINSON doesn't flinch.

</b>                         Colonel, this past February, you 
                         received a cautionary memo from the 
                         Naval Investigative Service, warning 
                         that the practice of enlisted men 
                         disciplining their own wasn't to be 
                         condoned by officers.

</b>                         I submit to you that whoever wrote 
                         that memo has never served on the 
                         working end of a Soviet-made Cuban 
                         Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the 
                         directive having come from the NIS, 
                         I gave it its due attention. What's 
                         your point, Jo?

                         still go on down here. Do Code Reds

                         part of close infantry training, and 
                         if it happens to go on without my

                         investigate me, roll the dice and 
                         take your chances. I eat breakfast

                         are trained to kill me. So don't for

               Jo walks out the door and KAFFEE closes it and locks it behind

               Then he says, very softly...

               A few M.P.Is are standing by the entrance. KAFFEE comes around 
               the corner and heads toward the courtroom. We're immediately 
               stricken by something:

               In his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a 
               real live naval officer. He opens the courtroom doors and 
               walks into

<b>               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY
</b>
               A few more M.P.'s are standing around. THE JURORS, nine 
               enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place, 
               Ross is at his table looking through some papers, and DAWSON 
               and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table. 
               The trial in a few moments from being underway and a few 
               people are milling about. KAFFEE walks down the aisle but is 
               stopped by a voice behind him.

               KAFFEE turns around to see a MAN and WOMAN who are clearly 
               Dawson's parents.

               KAFFEE continues on and stops next to JO, who's talking with 
               a WOMAN in her mid-30's.

               Not quite the words of inspiration KAFFEE was hoping to hear 
               before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do.

               He walks over to ROSS.

                         The facts of the case are this: At 
                         midnight on August 6th, the defendants 
                         went into the barracks room of their 
                         platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago.  
                         They woke him up, tied his arms and 
                         legs with rope, and forced a rag 
                         into his throat. A few minutes later, 
                         a chemical reaction in Santiago's 
                         body called lactic acidosis caused 
                         his lungs to begin bleeding. He 
                         drowned in his own blood and was 
                         pronounced dead at 32 minutes past 
                         midnight. These are the facts of the 
                         case. And they are undisputed. That's 
                         right. The story I just told you is 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, 
                         the Government will also demonstrate 
                         that the defendants soaked the rag 
                         with poison, and entered Santiago's 
                         room with motive and intent to kill.
                              (beat)
                         Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to 
                         pull off a little magic act, he's 
                         gonna try a little misdirection. 
                         He's going to astonish you with 
                         stories of rituals and dazzle you 
                         with official sounding terms like 
                         Code Red. He might even cut into a 
                         few officers for you. He'll have no 
                         evidence, mind you, none. But it's 
                         gonna be entertaining. When we get 
                         to the end, all the magic in the 
                         world will not have been able to 
                         divert your attention from the fact 
                         that Willy Santiago is dead, and 
                         Dawson and Downey killed him. These 
                         are the facts of the case.
                              (beat)
                         And they are undisputed.

               Before KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of

                         there was no intent to kill and any 
                         attempt to prove otherwise is futile 
                         because it just ain't true.

                         When Dawson and Downey went into 
                         Santiago's room that night, it wasn't 
                         because of vengeance or hatred, it 
                         wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't 
                         because they were looking for kicks 
                         on a Friday night. It's because it 
                         was what they were ordered to do.

                         Now, out in the real world, that 
                         means nothing. And here at the 
                         Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't 
                         mean a whole lot more. But if you're

                         follow it or you pack your bags.

                         run very fast.

               A long silence. KAFFEE makes a decision.

               A baseball game is on.

               KAFFEE's pacing slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. 
               He's looking at the blackboard as he walks around the room.

               He's studying it. Studying it hard. There's a knock on the 
               door. KAFFEE answers it. JO is standing in the doorway.

</b>                         Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order 
                         by my squad leader, Lance Corporal 
                         Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine 
                         Corps. And I followed it.

               it together.

                         As far as Downey was concerned, it 
                         was an order from Kendrick. It didn't 
                         matter that he didn't hear it first 
                         hand. He doesn't distinguish between 
                         the two.

               SAM understands, but he doesn't say anything. The door opens 
               and KAFFEE walks in.

                         Dawson charged with the Kennedy

                         Markinson took his own life with a 
                         .45 caliber pistol.

               And from the back of the room, SAM enters. He's escorting 
               two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms. SAM shows the 
               AIRMEN to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the 
               defense table.

                         leaving Guantanamo at six the next

</b>                         Your honor, these are the telephone 
                         records from GITMO for August 6th.  
                         And these are 14 letters that Santiago 
                         wrote in nine months requesting, in 
                         fact begging, for a transfer.
                              (to JESSEP)
                         Upon hearing the news that he was 
                         finally getting his transfer, Santiago 
                         was so excited, that do you know how 
                         many people he called? Zero. Nobody. 
                         Not one call to his parents saying 
                         he was coming home. Not one call to 
                         a friend saying can you pick me up 
                         at the airport. He was asleep in his 
                         bed at midnight, and according to 
                         you he was getting on a plane in six 
                         hours, yet everything he owned was 
                         hanging neatly in his closet and 
                         folded neatly in his footlocker. You 
                         were leaving for one day and you 
                         packed a bag and made three phone 
                         calls. Santiago was leaving for the 
                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called 
                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. 
                         Can you explain that? The fact is 
                         there was no transfer order. Santiago 
                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that 
                         right, Colonel.

                         that Lt. Kaffee's intention this 
                         morning is to smear a high ranking 
                         marine officer in the desperate hope 
                         that the mere appearance of 
                         impropriety will win him points with 
                         the jury. It's my recommendation,

                         official reprimand from the bench,

</b>                         Absolutely. My answer is I don't 
                         have the first damn clue. Maybe he 
                         was an early morning riser and he 
                         liked to pack in the nq. And maybe 
                         he didn't have any friends. I'm an 
                         educated man, but I'm afraid I can't 
                         speak intelligently about the travel 
                         habits of William Santiago.  What I 
                         do know is that he was set to leave 
                         the base at 0600. Now are these really 
                         the questions I was called here to 
                         answer? Phone calls and footlockers? 
                         Please tell me you've got something 
                         more, Lieutenant. Please tell me 
                         there's an ace up your sleeve. These 
                         two marines are on trial for their 
                         lives. Please tell me their lawyer 
                         hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone 
                         bill.
                              (beat)
                         Do you have any other questions for 
                         me, counselor?

               The courtroom is silenced. Jessep's slammed the door.

                         Colonel, I have just one more question 
                         before I call Airman O'Malley and 
                         Airman Perez: If you gave an order 
                         that Santiago wasn't to be touched, 
                         and your orders are always followed, 
                         then why would he be in danger, why 
                         would it be necessary to transfer 
                         him off the base?

               And JESSEP has no answer.

               Silence. From everyone. RANDOLPH, ROSS, the M.P.'s, they're 
               all frozen. JO and SAM are likewise. JESSEP seems strangely, 
               quietly relieved. KAFFEE simply takes control of the room

               out the door, followed by DOWNEY.

               ROSS walks over to the defense table.

                         absolutely no recollection of

               ROSS smiles.

               KAFFEE, JO and SAM are walking down the steps. The BAND is 
               practicing on the parade grounds.

                         she's gotta be bilingual by now.

               And SAM heads off toward his car.
