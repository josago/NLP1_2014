<b>          1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY.
</b>          We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within.
          Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON...

<b>          A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS
</b>          Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses --
          a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND...
          A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more
          beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO --
          A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the
          baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes.
          But.
          The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF
          LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET:
          FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!

<b>          THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND

          to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR --
          Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some
          superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we
          WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS --
          And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE

<b>          DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING
</b>
<b>          FLEEING PEOPLE.
</b>          Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap
          open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE --
          faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND.
          THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her
          baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read:

</b>
          burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN.
          Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD.
          We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>          A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a
          MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet.
          COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where
          the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...
          .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve
          this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist:
          A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the
          surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
          And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to
          shield his eyes... but STOFS:
          A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young,
          beautiful. SMILING.
          The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat?
          The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches
          toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.

<b>          THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE:
</b>          THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough.
          Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --

<b>                         WES CLAIBORNE
</b>          Howdy.

<b>                         (NO RESPONSE)
</b>          We're riding towards Absolution. You
          know how far west we are?
          The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.

<b>                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
</b>          Maybe he's a dummy.
          Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --

<b>                         WES CLAIBORNE
</b>          There a reason you don't wanna answer my
          question, friend?
          And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --

<b>                         MOSE CLAIBORNE
</b>          Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and
          he's been shot.

<b>                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
</b>          Bet he's a chain jumper.
          Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         LUKE
</b>          If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
          Let's bring him with us.
          Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
          scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --

<b>                         WES CLAIBORNE
</b>          Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn
          round and start walking.
          But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
          steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --

<b>          WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)
</b>          Dead or alive, no difference. I said

<b>                         WALK OR--
</b>          THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle
          forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE
          MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
          As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again --
          SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
          Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
          his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:

<b>                         LUKE CLAIBORNE
</b>          -- P-please, God -- d-don't --
          -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY.
          Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down,
          knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
          This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't
          seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at
          his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.
          The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES
          on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks
          it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --

<b>          "TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY

<b>          OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP

<b>          -- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP"
</b>
<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          (a hoarse whisper)
          Absolution...

<b>          SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER:
</b>          With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the
          third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off...
          sees the dog following...

</b>
<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Get outta here. Leave me alone.
          But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man
          turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
          VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is:

<b>          EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
</b>
          A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten.
          Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in --
          dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.
          His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.

<b>          INT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
          BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man
          looks at the dog and says --

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          Stay.
          The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's
          moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
          uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound --
          then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
          Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>          Palms to heaven, Friend.
          The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          Been shot.

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>          Only two kinds of men get shot --
          criminals and victims.
          (steps forward; hard)
          Which one're you?

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          don't know.
          Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when
          he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>          Got a name, son?

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          Don't know that either.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          5.

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          (a beat; then)
          ... English.
          Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO:

<b>          INT. CHURCH RECTORY - LATER
</b>
          A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and
          Meacham's studying The Man's wound:

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>          Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.
          (off The Man's look)
          Means somethin' burned it half closed.
          The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
          over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
          twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the
          strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --

<b>                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet?
          The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?"
          Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --

<b>                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Try'n hold still.
          He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
          slightly, but bears the pain.

<b>                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Where'd you ride in from?

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          West. Woke up in the desert.
          Looking up at the sun like I'd been
          dropped outta the sky.

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>          Seems I remember a story about that
          happening once... fella by the name of
          Lucifer.

<b>                         (GRINS)
</b>          How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for
          short.
          But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror:
          his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS --

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          Three men rode up. Drew on me.

<b>                         (STILL CONFUSED)
</b>          My hands... moved on their own.

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>
<b>                         (A BEAT)
</b>          Anything else you wanna confess to while
          you got my attention?
          And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but:

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          Everything that happened before I woke
          up...
          (shakes his head)
          It's gone.

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>          Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for
          your sins if you don't recall 'em. That
          bein' said...
          Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n'
          brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --

<b>                         MEACHAM (CONT'D)
</b>          I seen bad men do good things and good
          men do bad things. Whether you end up in
          heaven or hell... it's not God's plan...
          it's yours.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          You just got to remember what it was.
          The Man considers. Darkly --

<b>          THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>          What if I don't want to remember?

<b>                         MEACHAM

          On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a
          MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around
          the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the
          confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --

          Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES
          -- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS
          OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:

          Meacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple

          they see. RANCH HANDS drink their pay. Behind the bar, a MAN
          and WOMAN argue. DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty;
          he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY:

          He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's

<b>          EXT. DESERT PLAINS - DAWN
</b>
          Against the RISING SUN, Dolarhyde and 15 GUNMEN ride hard, armed
          to the teems. They REAR in the hills above Absolution. Dolar
          looks down through BINOCULARS as NAT COLORADO turns to...
          an incoming WIND. Across the valley, a massive BLACK CLOUD
          is starting to SWIRL. Violent BLUE FLASHES within. Eerie.

<b>                         GREAVEY
</b>          blue light... Clanton said he saw
          blue light before the cows disappeared...

<b>                         DOLARHYDE
</b>          Just a storm.

</b>          No storm I've ever seen... I say we wait
          'til it passes.
          But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees
          PERCY being carried into the prison wagon. Followed by Jake.

<b>                         DOLARHYDE
</b>          No time, they put him in an iron coach.
          With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks
          -- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:

<b>          EXT. ABSOLUTION - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          As Jake's loaded into the prison wagon after the still-
          unconscious Percy, he SEES MEACHAM through the barred window.
          The preacher flashes SYMPATHY as Wade takes out the cuff key:

<b>                         DEPUTY WADE
</b>          Gimme your wrist.
          Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a
          cuff... then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.

<b>                         JAKE
</b>          What're you --?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Best way to make a man stay put: chain
          him to his enemy.

<b>                         (A GRIN)
</b>          You lovebirds have a nice trip now.
          SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit
          back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit.
          Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down:
          HIS BRACELET. Has started PULSING RED. And it's getting WARM.
          Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening? As --
          OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard. EMMETT feeds the horses:

<b>                         EMMETT

<b>                         SHERIFF TAGGART
</b>          Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what
          these people pay me to do. And your
          mother would kill me if I brought you.
          Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --

<b>                         EMMETT
</b>          Good thing she's already dead then.
          And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing
          he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS:
          THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster
          toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE.
          IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing
          growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE:

<b>          ELLA (0.S. )
</b>
<b>          HEY!
</b>          Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:

<b>                         ELLA (CONT'D)
</b>          Tell me where you got that bracelet...

<b>                         JAKE

          hell alone.
          And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the
          dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback
          cover the coach in a protective ring.
          Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:

<b>                         DEPUTY WADE

          of the church stumbles...
          AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted --
           limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and
          Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES:
          WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET ---

<b>          SCHLUCK!!!! -- EMBEDDING IN THE ALIEN'S HEAD! WHIP TO --

          SHOCK. And for what seems like the first time, FEAR. She
          EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back... as slowly... people
          converge around the corpse:

          Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and
          muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns
          his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE

          With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face

          Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN (6) load the ALIEN
          CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances --

          He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and
          mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from

<b>                         JAKE
</b>          Oh shut up.
          Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
          VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:

          In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point

          "SAGUARO PASS." Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS...
          Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE
          CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL:

<b>          EXT. ABANDONED CABIN - DAY
</b>
          A DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in

          LIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet.
          Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot --
          DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE.
          Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS:

          A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED:

</b>          Where'd you get this?

<b>                         JAKE

          TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.

          She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft.
          Tender. Soulful.
          But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window:
          A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town.

          birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde?
          Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:

<b>                         DOLARHYDE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         EMMETT
</b>          Then maybe you should use that thousand
          dollars to buy yourself a new wife.
          Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and
          UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but
          it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:

<b>                         DOC
</b>          Madre Dios...
          And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's
          reacting to --
          AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even
          Dolarhyde looks nervous now:

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>          It was Winfield's Landing.
          They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN:
          Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133."
          ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?

          And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND
          BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where:
          SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the
          tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at
          the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --

<b>                         MEACHAM
</b>          That can't be good.
          The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND

<b>          PLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM --

          rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP.
          They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly...
          DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING:
          It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of
          TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a
          GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH.
          The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK
          and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE.

          then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING
          the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out.
          BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
          FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:

<b>          A COW. YES, A COW.
</b>          Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth,
          connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
          Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D":

<b>                         GREAVEY
</b>          Boss... it's one'a yours.
          Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:

<b>                         EMMETT
</b>          Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
          Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
          with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:

<b>                         DOC

          (forces a small smile)
          I'm sure your father is fine.
          But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:

</b>          Ho-ly shit.
          BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below:
          AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels
          facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the
          desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --

<b>          EXT. DESERT - THE PADDLEBOAT - MINUTES LATER

          TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides

          IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with
          COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides
          to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS
          the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:

<b>                         JAKE

          Upended gambling tables. WOODRATS scurry over FOOD. Every
          window's SMASHED... as if something just TOOK everyone.
          Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a
          WHISKEY FLASK. Colorado opposite, rubbing his MANGLED EAR.

          a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee. But
          WHAT? Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES.
          Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG. Hears a WHIMPER.
          Looks over and sees... EMMETT, huddled in a corner. CRYING.

          she's alone, then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool.
          Upper body NAKED in the moonlight. We catch only a FLASH of

          to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
          Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a

          It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing
          whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the
          gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is

          And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep

          The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks
          right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with
          a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.

</b>          Put your guns on the whore. He so much
          as twitches, blow her brains out her ear.
          AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
           the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:

</b>          Call her a whore again, that'll be the
          last word you ever say.

</b>          You ain't in no position to make threats,
          asshole. Hunt: take his gun.
          Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls
          the PISTOL from Jake's holster:

          A TRANSPORT. A dozen WORKER-BEE ALIENS try to corral the HORSES
          from the pen -- cruelly jabbing the animals with ALIEN CATTLE

          The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER
          and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS.

           SWINGING CLOSED to trap them!
          But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow

          A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES

          The first EXPLOSIVE BOLT shoots off. Ella jams her SHOTGUN into

          AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up
          along with it all.
          A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage.
          Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting

          From an OPENING in the Scout Ship, the sound of THUNDERING
          HOOVES as... ALL THE ANIMALS STAMPEDE OUT. Then, slowly...
          HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE emerge, dazed -- their minds slowly WAKING

          A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that
          GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE.
          We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two
          APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride
          in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE:

          bear it.
          Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:

</b>          Woodrow.

<b>                         DOLARHYDE

          Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:

<b>                         DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
</b>          Go_ _on.
          Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --

<b>                         SHERIFF TAGGART
</b>          What's this?

<b>                         DOLARHYDE

          I've signed it over to the township of
          Absolution.
          (off Taggart's LOOK)
          Considering I'm a businessman, I figure
          expansion's in both our interests. Needs
          the Sheriff's signature to be official.

<b>                         SHERIFF TAGGART

</b>          That so.
          With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES:

<b>                         SHERIFF TAGGART
</b>          What's this about twenty percent going to
          the Apaches?
          Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened
          rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:

<b>                         DOLARHYDE
</b>          Figure the only way not to piss 'em off
          is to buy 'em.

<b>                         SHERIFF TAGGART

          anyone off?

<b>                         DOLARHYDE
</b>          Just sign it, Goddamnit.
          With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
          flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:

<b>                         SHERIFF TAGGART
</b>          I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow,
          but I know you'd just be insulted.

<b>                         DOLARHYDE
</b>          Damn right.
          Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE
          UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of
          being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each
          other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck:

<b>                         DOC MARIA
</b>          SHH! The workers will hear
          us!!! Let them hear!
          As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under
          his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.

<b>                         DOC
</b>          What is this?

<b>                         MARIA
</b>          Look at the inscription.
          He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR
          SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:

<b>                         DOC
</b>          This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...

<b>                         MARIA

          She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME --

<b>          EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - DAY
</b>
          A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle
          bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for
          Jake to FOLLOW. He GRINS. As MUSIC begins to RISE -- HOPEFUL:

<b>          EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY
</b>
          In a LONG SHOT -- the distant SILHOUETTES of Happy BOUNDING
          through the shallow TWIN RIVERS, Jake following on horseback...

<b>          EXT. RIM OF CANYON - DAY
</b>
          As Jake approaches, APACHE SENTRIES emerge from rocks to keep
          outsiders away. Jake TIPS his hat and they nod, let him pass.
          He nears the bluff where ELLA, GREY WOLF, and the rest of the
          Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into
          the canyon. Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog
          with Jake. She smiles as he rides up, dismounts:

<b>                         ELLA
</b>          Second damn time that dog ran off on me.

<b>                         JAKE
</b>          Second time he brought me to you.
          Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And
          it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it --
          glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite,
          and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.

<b>                         JAKE (CONT'D)

          Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly

          (then; off her look)
          What.
          She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:

          An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his
          horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:

<b>                         JAKE

          A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS...
          But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't
          quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:

<b>                         JAKE
</b>          If I stay... it's not gonna be good for
          anybody, Ella.
          A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he
          slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:

<b>                         ELLA
</b>          Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird
          noises at night. Cattle mutilations.
          Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down

</b>          Big storms in places that don't get big
          storms.
          ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
          though he plays it down:

<b>                         JAKE
</b>          You goin' down there yourself?

<b>                         ELLA

          You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--

<b>                         JAKE
</b>          No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself
          just fine.

          Be seein' you around.

<b>                         ELLA
</b>          goodbye, Jake.
          He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and
          trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't
          be an idiot." Jake glances over --

          He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
          Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his
          chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...
          But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.
          TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap
          between them.
          Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best
          effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:

<b>                         JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>          Abilene happens to be on my way.
          He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO
          THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
          around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:

<b>                         JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>          Stop smiling, Goddammit.
          He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye
          look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT:
          The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the
          canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF
          DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE:
          ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The
          THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...

<b>          THE TWIN RIVERS GEYSERING UP INTO THE CANYON. COVERING ALL
</b>
<b>          EVIDENCE OF THE ALIEN SHIP AND 'Q T.
</b>          Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a
          nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI
          As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and
          Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset...
          Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.

<b>          FADE OUT.
