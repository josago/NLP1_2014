          An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome
          fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans
          against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing
          on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.
          He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that
          descends into the valley below.
          A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a
          paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears
          men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What'd the doctor say?

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-
          four hour bug. He gave me some pills.

<b>                         FOX
</b>
<b>                         (REASSURINGLY)
</b>          I told you. You probably just ate some
          bad gristle.
          Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They
          walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the
          path. Fox points:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Should we take the short cut or the
          scenic route?

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Let's take the short cut.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          But the scenic route is so much prettier.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>
<b>                         (SHRUGS)
</b>          OK, let's take the scenic route.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Great. It's actually slightly quicker,
          anyway.
          Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a
          quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her
          waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off
          down the scenic route.

<b>          EXT. FARM. DAY
</b>
          A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and
          a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A
          sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from
          the bushes outside a fence.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          What is a squab?

<b>                         FOX
</b>          You know what a squab is. It's like a
          pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of
          bird we can eat.
          Fox motions toward the edge of the property.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Should we go through the hole under the
          horse fence or climb the rail over the
          bridle path?

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Well, I guess the horse fence would be a
          little safer.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          But the bridle path puts us out right
          next to the squab shack.
          Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods
          nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What's wrong? I've never seen you like
          this. You're acting all skittish. Don't
          worry. I've been stealing birds for a
          living since before I could trot.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>
<b>                         (SHRUGS)
</b>          OK, let's take the --

<b>                         FOX
</b>          No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me
          the scenic route already.
          Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          By the way, you look unbelievably
          beautiful tonight. You're practically
          glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>          Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She
          stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her
          cheek.
          (NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this
          shot which can be literally lit from within.)
          With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and
          Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race
          along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window
          where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing
          hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond
          children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever
          sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and
          shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,
          bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely
          pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden
          shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
          rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.
          Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his
          finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs
          impatiently. They duck inside.
          They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in
          his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above
          them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his
          mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!
          Look at this.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Get away from there.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...
          (pointing to different spots)
          I guess if you come from over there, and
          you're standing at the door to the squab
          shack, this little gadget probably
          triggers the --
          (gesturing to Mrs. Fox)
          Move out of the way, darling. That's
          right where it's going to land.
          Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Come on! Stop it! Let's go!

<b>

</b>
<b>          4.
</b>          Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly
          from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of
          them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox
          and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          No, it just falls straight down right
          here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-
          loaded.
          Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,
          voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says

<b>                         QUIETLY:
</b>
<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          I'm pregnant.
          Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,
          that's great news!

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I
          want you to find another line of work.
          Pause. Fox nods.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,
          green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a
          river running through the middle.

          holly bushes.

<b>          INT. HOLE. DAY
</b>
          A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two
          bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a
          newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the
          temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin-
          striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at
          the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk.

          Victorian-style dress.

</b>          A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of
          it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Does anybody actually read my column? Do
          your friends ever talk about it?

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>
<b>                         (STILL STIRRING)
</b>          Of course. In fact, Rabbit's ex-
          girlfriend just said to me last week, "I
          should read Foxy's column," but they
          don't get the Gazette.
          (yelling into the next room)
          Ash! Let's get cracking!

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.

<b>                         (SIGHS)
</b>          I want to say I hate my job, but that
          would make it seem more important to me
          than I want people to think it is.
          Mrs. Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of
          bread. A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the
          bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is
          smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I'm sick.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          You're not sick.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I have a temperature.
          Mrs. Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his
          forehead.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          You don't have a temperature.
          Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I don't want to go.

<b>

</b>
<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Hurry up. You're going to be late.
          Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast
          and coffee. Fox whispers to her:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I love the way you handled that.
          Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first
          thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be
          extra nice to him, because he's going
          through a very hard time right now, OK?
          Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white
          cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into
          them. He says aggressively:

<b>                         ASH
</b>          Where's he going to sleep?

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          We're going to make a bed for him in your
          room tonight.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I can't spare the space. Put him in Dad's
          study.
          Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Dad's study is occupied by Dad.
          Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He
          looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
          It makes me feel poor.
          Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says

<b>                         SOFTLY:
</b>
<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          We are poor -- but we're happy.
          Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating:

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>          7.
</b>
<b>                         FOX
</b>          Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are
          better above ground.
          Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of
          coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My
          father died at seven and a half. I don't
          want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm
          going to do something about it.
          Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of
          toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands
          and picks up his cup of coffee.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Well, I'm off.
          Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on
          the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his
          newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts

<b>                         CHEERILY:
</b>
<b>                         FOX
</b>          Have a good day, my darlings!
          Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white
          cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his
          teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves
          briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks
          puzzled.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What's he wearing?
          Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves
          back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded
          up section of his newspaper.

<b>                         INSERT:
</b>          A clipping from the real estate section. There is a
          photograph of a wide, sprawling beech tree at the top of a
          hill. A caption below it reads:

          A door opens into a wide, low space with peeling paint. There
          is an old chair against the wall, a bare light bulb hanging

</b>          from the ceiling, and a layer of dust over everything. A
          skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as Fox
          comes into the living room:

<b>                         WEASEL
</b>          Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous.
          Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping
          stone hearth --
          Weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank. He and Fox
          peer into the next room. A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick
          tinkers with some pipes under the kitchen sink. He is Kylie.
          Weasel snaps at him:

<b>                         WEASEL
</b>          What'd I tell you? I'm showing the
          property. You're not supposed to be here.

<b>                         KYLIE
</b>          (checking his watch)
          Oh, cuss. What time is it? I'm sorry.
           Weasel sighs. He waves his arm in Kylie's direction and says
          distractedly, slightly annoyed:

<b>                          WEASEL
</b>           This is Kylie. He's the super.
           (aside to Fix)
          He's a little --
          Weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw. Fox nods. He
          points at a bucket on the floor next to Kylie among bolts,
          tools, and washers.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

<b>                         KYLIE
</b>
<b>                         (HESITATES)
</b>          Just minnows. You want one?

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Certainly. Thank you.
          Kylie reaches into his bucket and hands Fox a live, wriggling
          minnow. Fox swallows it whole.
          Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry

          awkward back-flip during which he appears to have four arms
          and three legs randomly attached to his body, flailing
          wildly. He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks
          into the surface back-first with a pained yelp. Fox grimaces.

          sleeker, and it is immediately apparent even by his posture
          infinitely more graceful than Ash. He is Kristofferson. He
          wears a professional Speedo with a patch on it that says Swim

          Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved
          but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox
          leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head,

          Seventy-five chickens stand around quietly but anxiously,

          air.

</b>          Oh, nothing? Never mind.
          Fox and Kylie veer off into shorter grasses. Fox points

          Fox and Kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves

          Pause. Fox pulls himself together. He turns to look at the
          plywood lightning bolt.

<b>                         FOX

          Fox and Kylie climb a tree and crouch at the end of one of
          its branches. Fox produces a zip-loc bag filled with
          blueberries with white thread stitched into them.

<b>                         FOX

          Fox puts a blueberry into the end of a straw and shoots it
          out into the barnyard.

          #1. A beagle approaches it and sniffs at it. He eats it. He
          looks very pleased. He falls over, out cold.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          Fox with an ecstatic expression on his face. He rapidly
          shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard. Beagles
          eat blueberries and fall over, one after another. Fox and
          Kylie drop down into the barnyard and head for Chicken House
          #1. Fox whispers excitedly as they run:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Beagles love blueberries! Didn't I tell
          you? The master plan's working again!
          Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an
          unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and they
          weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance
          to the chicken house, open the door, and duck inside.
          Pause. There is an eruption of crazed squawking, screaming,
          and fighting from inside. The chicken house rumbles. Lights
          jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes off. Voices yell.
          The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and Kylie
          emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead
          chickens, and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:

<b>                         FOX

          unharmed. Kylie shrugs. Fox kills the chicken with one quick
          flick of the jaws. Kylie looks horrified.

<b>                         KYLIE

          Fox and Kylie dash to the electric fence. They stop in front

<b>                         KYLIE
</b>          What's the master escape plan?
          Fox hesitates, confused. A gunshot fires from among the
          chicken houses. Fox shouts to Kylie:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Follow me again!
          Fox and Kylie run back across the barnyard, past the beagles
          as they begin to wake up and stagger around. Farmhands
          appear, loading shotguns and running into the confusion. Fox
          and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them. They dart into the
          house through a flap in the back door. The lights are out in
          the kitchen. They take a moment, breathing hard in the
          darkness. Kylie shakes his head in disbelief.

<b>                         KYLIE
</b>          Wow. That was amazing. How did we do
          that? We ran the other way or something.

          Fox opens the door-flap a crack. He looks out and sees Boggis
          opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands,
          barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox
          shouts to Kylie:

          Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door-
          flap, race across the barnyard, and dart through the open
          gate. Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with
          his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the
          bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says

<b>                         BREATHLESSLY:

          comes out of his nose.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the door of Boggis' Chicken House #7
          carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt on. Farmhands
          run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
          cut into the electric fence.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the window of Bunce's Poultry Barn C
          carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring. Farmhands
          run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
          knocked into a brick wall.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean's Apple Orchard XII
          carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples. Automatic
          doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie
          escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade.
          Fox and Kylie run full-speed through a clover field in the
          dark. The camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford
          a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and cross into the willow
          glade. They look exhilarated.

          Mrs. Fox studies a crayon price-tag labelled $4 attached to a
          wax-paper-wrapped parcel. She opens the parcel and holds up a
          dead chicken by the leg. There is a small metal clip around
          its ankle. She examines it. She frowns.
          Fox comes in, grabs an apple out of a bowl, and starts back
          out of the room.

          Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at the children's table
          eating dinner. Next to Ash, there is a small, slightly beaten-
          up statue of a fox with his front legs raised in the air
          holding a medal above his head. Kylie points at it.

          for being an athlete.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at the adults' table. Fox guzzles down a
          last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food:

          Fox pulls his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the

          Fox and Kylie dart across the yard and around the back of

          Fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window

          bars.

          A vast, damp, gloomy cellar with hundreds of glass jars
          stacked from floor to ceiling. Each jar is marked Cider. Fox
          and Kylie come inside and quietly drop to the brick floor.

<b>                         KYLIE WHISPERS:

</b>          Apple juice? Apple juice? We didn't come
          here for apple juice. This is some of the
          strongest, finest alcoholic cider money
          can buy -- or that can even be stolen. It
          burns in your throat, boils in your
          stomach, and tastes almost exactly like
          pure, melted gold.

</b>          Let's crack open one these 'shine jars

          A match strikes in the darkness. Fox and Kylie look around
          the room frantically. On the highest shelf, peering out from
          behind a huge jar, they see an enormous rat in a striped
          shirt with a lit match in his claw. He puts the flame in his
          mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth.
          He is longer than a fox and wiry, but with a small pot-belly.
          He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik.
          He takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck
          of his cider jar. He says with a slightly sinister New

          'Round these parts, we don't take kindly
          to cider poachers.
          Fox and Rat stare at each other. Fox says, finally:

</b>          You've aged badly, Rat.

          Rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a shelf,
          down the wall, and through the air onto the brick floor at
          Fox's feet. He flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it.
          He hisses.

          in the wall. Fox takes an old-fashioned boxing stance.

</b>          How's your old lady doin'?
          Kylie peers out from his hole in the wall nervously. Fox and
          Rat circle each other slowly.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Do you refer to my wife?

          you made an honest woman out of her, Mr.
          Fox.
          Kylie says, intrigued, from his hole:

          Rat lunges at Fox with his switchblade. Fox dodges nimbly. He
          cocks an eyebrow and smiles:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          That was close, Rat. Be careful.

          A door at the top of the stairs opens suddenly with a loud
          creak. Rat and Fox look terrified. They both dart away and
          hide behind cider jars.
          A heavy-set, middle-aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin
          comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf
          where Fox is hiding.

          A strong, almost masculine woman's voice answers from

          The housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one
          Fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm. Fox tenses
          his body. He shivers slightly. A graze of the red fur of his
          arm sticks out barely from behind his jar. The housekeeper
          hesitates.

          Bean is standing darkly in his front doorway. Smoke drifts
          from the end of his Luger, pointed at the ceiling. A broken
          light bulb hangs from a wire above his head. Boggis and Bunce
          sit together on the porch in rocking chairs, startled,
          staring at Bean.

<b>                         BEAN
</b>          I'm going to give a speech, and at the
          end of it -- I'm going to throw a twist
          into this plot.
          Bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the
          porch.

<b>                         BEAN
</b>          First truth: this is the most ambitious
          fox we've ever encountered, bar none.
          Bean spins around and shoots out a second light bulb. Boggis

</b>          Second truth: the meaning of ambition is
          defined in the dictionary.
          Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb.

<b>                         BEAN
</b>          Third truth: the weakness of the
          ambitious man is his Achilles heel --
          Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his
          back, over his shoulder, and between his legs. The porch goes
          dark. He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two
          colleague's faces. They look scared. Bean says urgently:

<b>                         BEAN
</b>          -- but I've already figured out where
          this fox lives, and tomorrow night we're
          going to camp in the bushes, wait for him
          to come out of the hole in his tree, and
          shoot the cuss to smithereens. How's that
          grab you, fellas?
          Boggis and Bunce hesitate. They nod and murmur their
          approval.

          Fox and Kylie come quietly into the half-lit kitchen dressed
          in their prowling outfits. They walk to the door.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Another book party?
          Fox and Kylie turn around, startled. Mrs. Fox sits on a stool
          in the darkened pantry.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Woah! I didn't see you. Sitting in the
          dark over there. Yeah, no. Actually,
          there's a fire. I just got the call. They
          said maybe it's arson? I got to interview
          the marshall and see what's --

<b>          MRS. FOX

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in the bushes. Bean
          licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the
          wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to
          Boggis and Bunce.

</b>
          Fox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He
          moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a
          moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says

<b>                         STONILY:
</b>

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its
          direction.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a
          row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          All three!
          Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A
          barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark.
          Silence.

</b>          Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air.
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his
          flashlight on Fox's hole.
          In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood-
          stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it
          in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce.

<b>                         BEAN
</b>          We got the tail, but we missed the fox.
          Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie.

<b>                         BEAN
</b>          Petey? You and the boys sober up and get

          Mrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with
          gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox
          cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly:

<b>                         ASH
</b>          It'll grow back, won't it?

<b>                         KYLIE

          one foot on a banana peel. That's a lot

          Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor. It
          ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls
          silent. Kristofferson turns away.

</b>          Excuse me, everyone. I'm going to go
          meditate for half an hour.
          Kristofferson walks out of the room. Mrs. Fox looks at Ash
          and says angrily:

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up
          with a proper apology.
          Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares
          straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape
          and the pants tucked into your socks?
          Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging
          his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back
          to the room.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I got fired slash quit the Gazette and

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>
<b>                         (ICILY)
</b>          That tail was the first thing I ever
          noticed about you. It was easily the most
          attractive tail for at least 50 miles in
          every direction. It was probably your
          single best quality -- and now it's gone
          forever.

           There is a quiet scraping sound from above. Fox jumps out of
          bed. He hollers:

<b>                          FOX
</b>           Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us
          out!

</b>          You say one thing, she says another, and
          it all changes back again!
          The point of a shovel pierces the ceiling. Everyone looks up
          and stares in shock. Fox suddenly leaps across the room with
          a wild energy, scrambles halfway up a wall, and throws over
          two chairs.

<b>                         FOX

          booms down into the ground, among the roots of the tree,
          through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean
          mineral deposits.

          underground. Mrs. Fox lies on the floor, breathing heavily,
          with a lit lantern at her side. The cubs are sprawled out
          around her. Kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off tied
          around his waist. Fox stands up and clears his throat.
          Everyone looks at him.

          Fox reluctantly follows Mrs. Fox through a crack in the
          bedrock and into a small air-pocket with glittering quartz
          walls. She wheels on Fox:

<b>          MRS. FOX

          Mrs. Fox scratches Fox across the face, slicing a quick
          sliver into his fur. Fox cringes away with his paws up
          protectively. He lowers his paws. His eyes fill with tears.
          (NOTE: the scar in Fox's fur never grows back.)
          Mrs. Fox takes a deep breath. She says:

<b>          MRS. FOX

          Fox looks down at the ground. He nods and tries to contain
          his emotions. Mrs. Fox watches him coldly.

<b>          MRS. FOX

          been completely removed. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand half-
          underground with their heads sticking out of the hole,
          breathing hard, with dirty shovels over their shoulders.

          spit black grease and smoke.

          giddily to each other. They scramble into the drivers' seats

          There is a full moon. Lanterns glow in the farmers' tents. A
          group of farmhands sit around a campfire next to the crater.
          One of them cooks a chicken on a spit. Another sits on a log
          playing a banjo. He is Petey. He sings:

          The shot moves past the leathery faces of the other farmhands
          as they listen: amused, moved, hungry, tired, charmed,
          annoyed, whistling, playing a jew's harp, trying to sing

          at the end of the tunnel. Dirt crumbles out of it -- and a
          bit of metal catches a glint. Fox and his family watch,
          frozen. A breath of air blows into the tunnel.
          The flame on Mrs. Fox's lantern flickers once and goes out.

          stands in front of Fox with his law partner Beaver, Beaver's

          mouse with a bandana tied in a "do-rag" style around his

          mouth, and forces his jaws up and down in a chewing motion.
          Ash coughs and splutters. Kristofferson frowns. He takes off

          Beaver's son looks to Kristofferson. He looks down at

          Kristofferson kicks Beaver's son in the face, karate chops
          his neck, elbow-jabs him twice in the gut, and flips the
          enormous youth over his shoulder and into the mud. Beaver's
          son gets up, crying, and walks out of the alcove.
          Ash watches blankly with mud all over his mouth as

          Badger waits for Fox to continue. Fox stares into space.

</b>          Give me a minute.
          Fox turns and walks away. He faces the wall of the tunnel. He
          sits down on a rock. Everyone watches him uncertainly. They
          look at each other. Badger starts to say something, but Kylie
          cuts him off sharply:

          Badger falls silent. Fox sits with his chin on his paw, lost
          in concentrated thought. He stands up. He nods repeatedly and
          begins to pace. His eyes dart from one spot to another. His
          paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and
          shapes. He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of
          the tunnel. He snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the
          others. He says with a cautious excitement:

<b>                         FOX

          Fox looks down at Ash, who stands beside him with mud still
          on his mouth. He nods. He says suddenly:

</b>

          Fox grips Mrs. Fox's paw. He looks into her eyes and says

</b>

          Mrs. Fox detects a special, familiar, inspired light in her
          husband's eyes at this moment. She nods. She hands Ash the
          lantern. She straightens the neck-line of his cape, licks the
          mud off Ash's snout, and scrambles away down Badger's tunnel.
          Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the others.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a
          very special direction.
          Fox feels the walls with his paws. Everyone watches
          attentively.

</b>          I got to kind of feel out the vibe.
          Fox stops. He points slightly downwards and due south. He
          says with quiet anticipation:

          and raises his fist.
          The diggers stop digging. Fox feels the ceiling with his
          paws. He knocks something hard. It sounds hollow. He looks at
          the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow.
          Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard. It creaks loudly. They
          all duck down and wait. Nothing happens. Fox pushes up a
          second floorboard. He cautiously pokes his head up through

<b>          INT. SHED. NIGHT

          Everyone stands in the middle of Boggis' Chicken House #1.
          The room is teeming with chickens, which stare at them
          nervously. There are black chickens, white chickens, brown
          chickens, and one that combines all three colors. Fox

          The others nod. They look dazed and wild. Fox holds up his

          properly. First, everyone have a drink of

          Fox leads the others over to the chickens' drinking trough.
          They all lap up the cool water. Fox dries his mouth.

          and dance an ecstatic jig in a corrugated plastic and metal

          Fox and the other diggers race dancing ecstatically back
          through the complex network of tunnels carrying dead turkeys,
          geese, bacon, flour, salt, sugar, jars of cider, and a

          The flint-mine is a large but cozy space with stone walls, a
          dirt floor, a small kitchen, and a fireplace. There are rows
          of cots, sleeping bags, boxes, blankets, and suitcases for
          all the refugee animals. All the animals have gathered
          together and drink cider cocktails while small rabbits,
          skunks, and field mice set the table. The room is festooned
          with garlands. A well-dressed mole smoking a pipe plays the
          piano. A bespectacled rabbit leans against it humming a tune.
          Weasel stands in the corner talking with Beaver.

          Ash drinks his punch in one long sip and holds out the empty
          mug for a refill. Kristofferson nods slowly. He points at Ash
          with his ladle.

          Kristofferson starts to refill Ash's mug again. Ash suddenly
          puts his paw over the brim. Kristofferson hesitates. Ash
          raises an eyebrow and says mysterriously:

          A large fire truck drives up to the destroyed hill with
          firemen hanging off the back and sides. It parks among the
          tractors and tents. The chief, in a white helmet, goes over
          to Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting at the mouth of the pit. A
          patch on his sleeve says O.W.F.R.P.F. Farmhands and firemen

<b>          INT. FLINT-MINE. DAY
</b>
          Candles glow all around. Everyone is seated at the long
          dining room table, and a magnificent feast with every variety
          of fruit, meat, vegetable, and roasted bird has been laid out
          in front of them. They tear into their meals, eating and
          drinking ferociously. Crumbs, juices, blood, and bones fly
          into the air. Jaws snap and chew. There is no conversation.
          Badger suddenly stands and rings a knife against his cider
          glass. Everyone looks up, taking a breather from the frenzy
          of eating. Badger clears his throat.

<b>                         BADGER
</b>          Well, it took a near-catastrophe for all

          with a crooked smile on his face.

          down.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          The hole where Fox's tree once stood. The dead tree lies on
          its side. A fireman slides a thick hose deep into the tunnel.
          He looks behind him and nods.

          The shot moves backwards along the hose, past seven more

          fist in the air, a swirl of the fingers, a peace symbol, an A-
          OK, and a hook-'em Horns. The shot continues past Boggis,
          Bunce, and Bean helping to hold the hose in position. Boggis
          growls. Bunce hisses. Bean snarls. The shot arrives at a pump
          on the side of the fire truck. The chief points:

<b>                         CHIEF

          A fireman cranks a huge wrench on a steel nut. A pressure
          gauge shoots to maximum. The fire truck and hose begin to
          vibrate loudly.

</b>          Ash and Kristofferson crouched under a drain-cover pushed
          just-open next to a refrigerator. They peer out across a
          bright, clean, white kitchen at a plate of perfect, golden
          cookies on a counter-top next to an open window with a step-
          ladder directly in front of it. They look at each other. They
          look around the quiet, empty room. Ash shrugs.
          Ash and Kristofferson dart out, leaving the drain-cover
          propped-up. They race over the linoleum. They climb the step-
          ladder and stop at the plate. Ash swoons and says

          Ash and Kristofferson gather more cookies than they can
          possibly carry, eating as they collect them. Crumbs go
          everywhere.
          On the other side of the room, the drain-cover falls shut
          with a loud clank. Ash and Kristofferson look up, wildly
          startled. All at once they hear in a simultaneous cacophony:
          the back door bursting open, a boy and two beagles shouting
          and barking, the pantry door slamming, Mrs. Bean and her

          something, anyway, which nobody wants to
          admit, but I think is probably true: we
          beat 'em. We beat those farmers, and now
          we're triumphantly eating their roasted
          chicken, their sizzling duck, their
          succulent turkey, their foie gras de --

          (to Mrs. Fox)
          What am I hearing again, baby? What's
          happening? Am I still paranoid?
          There is a low, distant rumbling which rapidly builds to a
          deafening roar. Everyone waits, frozen. A single drop of
          water drips from the ceiling into Badger's water glass. Fox
          turns to Badger and says:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Let's pause again.
          A wild deluge smashes into the room flooding the flint-mine
          and tunnels with a blasting current that sweeps everyone and
          everything away chaotically.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          The entire party of well-dressed animals and their plates,
          furniture, chickens, etc. shooting down the tunnel with the
          rushing waters. Fox, helpless, holding his breath, looks to
          the others underwater: Badger shakes his head in disgust;
          Rabbit makes a fierce grimace; Mole bares his teeth
          ferociously; Beaver rants angrily with bubbles coming out off
          his mouth; and Kylie stares ahead vacantly, holding his nose.

</b>          Fox turns sadly to Mrs. Fox. She looks terrified.

<b>          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT
</b>
          The flood blasts out of a wide pipe rocketing the animals
          into a murky, brick cavern with drainpipes on all sides and
          three inches of black water on its floor. Fox picks himself
          up, dazed and scared, and looks around at his soaked friends
          and their families.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What the cuss just happened? Something
          with water. That was dangerous. Is anyone
          hurt?

<b>                         (FURIOUS )

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Let's do a head-count! Everybody pick a
          buddy!
          Each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their buddy
          relationship. Fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart
          about, searching. He shouts:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson?
          Ash's voice cracks on the other side of the cavern:

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I'm here.
          Everyone turns to see Ash standing at the mouth of a smaller
          pipe. He looks devastated and terrified. Fox points to him.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Ash! Who's your buddy?

<b>                         ASH
</b>          Kristofferson, but I lost him.

</b>          You lost him? Where were you?

<b>                         ASH
</b>          We went for cookies.
          Everyone turns to Fox. Fox yells desperately:

</b>          Kristofferson!
          Fox sprints around the cavern, splashing, digging, and
          ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join his frantic
          search. His voice sounds pained as he shouts:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Kristofferson! Kristofferson!
          Kristofferson!

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          The three farmers standing next to the fire truck. Bean holds
          a soaked, half-conscious Kristofferson up in the air by the
          tail. Kristofferson is quietly crying.

          Everyone has gathered together. They are all in a state of
          shock. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox beside him.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Your brother's going to kill me, if he
          survives his double-pneumonia.
          Beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a drainpipe,

<b>                         SHOUTING:
</b>
<b>                         BEAVER
</b>          There's only one way out of this sewer,
          but the manhole cover's closed, and
          there's a station-wagon parked on it --
          which means we're permanently stuck down
          here.

</b>
<b>                         (BITTERLY)
</b>          You still think we beat 'em, Foxy?
          Everyone turns to Fox and stares at him coldly. Fox sits down
          on the floor, in the water. He says quietly:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Somebody take over. I'm not in charge
          anymore.

</b>          Everyone looks around at each other. They don't know what to
          do. Mrs. Fox sits down in the water next to Fox.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          You told me to change, but I can't --

          think I just did.

</b>          Well, then maybe we're not all going to
          die.
          Fox looks to Mrs. Fox. He stands up suddenly. He takes Mrs.
          Fox's hand.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Excuse us, everyone.
          Fox leads Mrs. Fox over to a ledge near a cement waterfall on
          the far side of the brick cavern. He puts his arm around her
          waist.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Badger's right. These farmers aren't
          going to quit until they catch me. I

          fired from the Gazette. I shouldn't have
          pushed these farmers so far and tried to
          embarrass them and cuss with their heads.
          I enjoyed it, but I shouldn't have done
          it -- and now there's only one way out.
          Maybe if I hand myself over and let them

</b>          Darling, maybe they'll let everyone else
          live.
          Mrs. Fox stares at Fox. She says desolately:

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I don't know, but I have a possible
          theory. I think I have this thing where I
          need everybody to think I'm the greatest
          -- the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox --
          and if they aren't completely knocked-
          out, dazzled, and kind of intimidated by
          me, then I don't feel good about myself.
          Mrs. Fox shakes her head and turns away. Fox continues:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Foxes traditionally like to court danger,
          hunt prey, and outsmart predators -- and
          that's what I'm actually good at! I
          think, at the end of the day, I'm just --

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>
<b>                         (QUIETLY)
</b>          We're wild animals.
          Fox smiles sadly and nods. He shrugs.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I guess we always were. I promise you: if
          I had all this to do over again, I'd have
          never let you down. It was always more
          fun when we did it together, anyway.
          Mrs. Fox has tears all over her face. Fox kisses her. He
          whispers in her ear:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I love you, Felicity.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          I love you, too, but I shouldn't have
          married you.
          Mrs. Fox turns and walks away. Fox stares after her. He goes
          over to Ash.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Did I ever tell you about the time I
          learned we were going to have a cub?

</b>          In the fox-trap.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Let me tell it, OK? I had no idea how we
          were going to get out of this jam, and
          then it hit me: what do foxes do better
          than any other animal?

<b>                         ASH
</b>          Dig.

</b>          Keep telling it.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          So we dug. And the whole time I put paw
          over paw, scooping dirt and pebbles with
          your mother digging like crazy beside me,
          I kept wondering: who is this little boy
          going to be?

<b>                         ASH
</b>          Or girl.

</b>           Or girl, right -- because at that point
           we didn't know.
          Fox grabs Ash by his shoulders and looks him in the eye.

<b>                          FOX
</b>           Ash, I'm so glad he was you.
          Fox hugs Ash tightly, holds him for an instant, then let's
          go. He turns to the group.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Badger, organize a search party and try
          to find Kristofferson. Maybe he's alive.

</b>          Well, good-bye.
          Fox looks across the cavern to Mrs. Fox standing with her
          back to him. She turns to face him. Her eyes are burning. Fox
          smiles sadly. He races away down the drain-pipe. Everyone
          watches him disappear. Badger hesitates. He addresses the

          Fox sprints full-speed in the darkness. His claws scratch
          rattling along the iron floor and splash through puddles of
          shallow water.
          Fox stops suddenly. He stands up tall on his hind legs. His
          ears perk up. One pins back. He listens.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          Badger carrying a lantern leading Ash, Mole, and two small
          rabbits down a drainpipe. Badger calls out:

</b>          Kristofferson? Hello? Can you hear us?
          Rat's voice echoes in the darkness:

</b>          Y'all lookin' for somethin'? Nothin' down
          here but rusty bottle-caps and drainin'
          water.
          Everyone stops short. Rat drops into the pipe from an
          overhead drain ahead of them. He says ominously:

<b>                         RAT
</b>          They got the boy.

</b>          Well-done, Mr. Badger. You're a smart

</b>          Rat flicks a folded letter through the air. Badger catches
          it. He opens it. Kylie looks over his shoulder. Badger
          frowns.

<b>                         BADGER
</b>          Why'd they write this in letters cut out
          of magazines?

<b>                         KYLIE
</b>          To protect their identities.
          (on second thought)
          Oh, right, but then why'd they sign their
          names? Plus, we already knew who they
          were because they're trying to kill us.

<b>                         INSERT:
</b>          A ransom note written in letters cut out of magazines and
          pasted onto a piece of paper. Badger reads out loud:
          Mr. Fox, we have your son. If you
          ever want to see him alive again --
          Ash calls out:

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I'm his son.
          Everyone looks at Ash. He stands behind them in silhouette.
          Rat says darkly:

<b>                         RAT
</b>          I can see the resemblance.
          Pause. In an instant, Rat grabs Ash by the tail, picks him up
          off the ground, swings him in the air, and flings him away
          twenty feet down the drainpipe. Badger looks stunned.
          Ash sits in a puddle in a stupor. Rat races toward him down
          the tunnel. He leaps into the air with his claws out and his
          teeth bared. As he is about to seize upon Ash -- he is
          suddenly jerked backwards and spun around.
          Rat is face to face with Fox. Fox strikes his old-fashioned
          boxing stance. He draws back and throws a hard punch, nailing
          Rat square in the jaw. Rat staggers, stunned. He swings his
          switchblade, cutting Fox across the chest.
          Fox touches the wound and looks at the blood on the fingers
          of his paw. He looks to Rat. Rat holds up his wrist and shows
          Fox a child's plastic digital watch with miniature footballs,
          baseballs, and soccer balls on it. He says strangely:

</b>          I said I've still got the watch, Mr. Fox.
          She never asked for it back.
          A frozen moment. Fox springs forward and clamps his jaws onto
          Rat's throat. Rat tumbles over backwards. Fox pins him to the
          ground with his teeth in Rat's neck. Rat kicks and bucks and
          struggles, but Fox holds him fast. Rat goes limp. Fox
          releases him.
          Everyone slowly gathers around Fox and Rat. Ash kneels next
          to his father. Fox cradles Rat in his arms. Rat whispers:

<b>                         RAT
</b>          The boy's locked in an apple crate on top
          of a gun-locker in the attic of Bean

          Rat smiles sickly. Blood drips from his mouth. His voice

<b>                         CREAKS:

</b>          (shaking his head)
          All these wasted years. What were you
          looking for, Rat?
          Fox wipes the blood from Rat's chin. Rat mutters.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          He's trying to say something, Dad.
          Fox leans his ear close to Rat's mouth. As quiet as a mouse,

<b>                         RAT WHISPERS:

</b>          Fox nods. He looks around the drainpipe. He cups his paw into
          the pool of murky water and holds it to Rat's lips.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Here you are, Rat. A beaker of Bean's
          finest secret cider.
          Rat's slivery, scratchity, long, pink tongue laps up a taste
          of the black liquid. He licks his lips and says faintly:

<b>                         RAT
</b>          Like melted gold.
          Rat's eyes turn into X's. He is dead. Ash stands up.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          He redeemed himself.

          Fox swallows and says hopelessly with tears in his eyes:

</b>          But, in the end -- he's just another dead
          rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese
          restaurant.
          Ash puts his hand on Fox's shoulder. Fox lays Rat gently onto
          the sewer floor. He stands up and turns to the rest of the
          group. Badger claps his paws together.

          The entire community of animals has reconnoitered in the
          brick cavern. Fox stands on a large spigot and addresses the
          group. He has a bandage on his chest.

          agent, an excellent tailor, a crack
          accountant, a gifted musician, a pretty
          good minnow fisherman, and possibly the
          best landscape painter working on the
          scene today.
          As Fox describes them, the shot cuts to: Badger and Beaver;
          Mrs. Badger; Rabbit; Weasel; an especially small, waifish
          field mouse; Mole; Kylie (who looks slightly offended); and
          Mrs. Fox, respectively.

          Fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking
          it. A few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking. Fox
          finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor.
          He makes a smashing-glass sound. Kylie shouts:

          Mrs. Fox puts the finishing touches on a vast mural painted
          on the longest, tallest wall of the brick cavern. She stands
          on a ladder. Her sleeves are rolled up, and she is splattered
          with twelve different colors of paint. She looks down to Fox
          standing below with an entourage of Kylie, Badger, Linda, and
          Rickity. The animal children mop and scrub in the background.
          Ash stands leaning against a push-broom watching his parents.
          Fox surveys the mural. It is highly detailed, filled with the
          textures of the landscape, and decorated with images of
          flowers, leaves, acorns, etc. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox

          He calls out:

<b>                         KRISTOFFERSON

          A cement conduit with an iron grating above it. A fast stream
          of sewer water runs along its side. Fox walks briskly down
          the pipe followed by his entourage and Ash. Their steps echo
          loudly.

          near -- can I tell this another time? We

          Ash comes up to Fox's side and says discreetly:

          An old craftsman looks out from the window of Ferguson
          Cobblers as he taps little nails into the heel of a loafer. A
          station-wagon with wood-grain side-panels and a flat tire
          sits parked on a manhole cover in front of the shop. Boggis,
          Bunce, and five armed farmhands watch as Bean monkeys with a
          slim-jim until he gets the car door jimmied.
          Bean hops inside. He starts the engine, puts his arm over the
          top of the seat as he looks back out the rear window, and
          throws the station-wagon into reverse. The farmers clear out
          of the way as Bean backs up off the manhole cover.
          Boggis and Bunce stick tools into the manhole cover and lift
          it open.

          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean crouch behind the open doors of a
          pick-up truck with three beagles. Boggis checks his carbine.
          Bunce loads his shotgun. Bean cocks his Luger. Fox's voice
          hollers from deep inside the manhole:

          Bunce presses play on a tape recorder. Kristofferson's voice

</b>          Come on! That doesn't sound anything like
          him! It's amateur night in Dixie!
          Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together. A bit
          chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on some
          kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket.

<b>          EXT. STREET. DAY
</b>
          A ribbon of white smoke rises out of the manhole. The three
          farmers watch curiously as it thickens and turns black. Bean
          frowns.

<b>                         BEAN
</b>          What the cuss is he burning?
          A blazing pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies
          through the air, over the farmers' heads. It lands in a trash
          can and lights some rubbish on fire. A man with a dart in one
          hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the Nag's
          Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes
          out.
          The three farmers laugh smugly. Bean shouts:

<b>                         BEAN
</b>          Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox?
          Twenty-seven blazing pinecones shoot out of the manhole and
          hit: a wood-pile on the roof of the Nag's Head, a box of
          pastry wrappers in the bushes behind Sweetings, a stack of
          brochures in the window of Harrison Travel, a hay bale in the
          bed of the pick-up truck, Boggis, Bunce, Bean, and a crate of
          cam-corder batteries next to the Action 13 camera crew, which
          explodes. Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and
          tamping out the flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and
          scramble in the confusion.
          Rabbit darts out of the hole and races up the street. Six
          farmers chase after him, firing their weapons.

          Down in the brick cavern, Mole listens to a tin can attached
          to a string. He says urgently as he makes notations in a

          Mrs. Fox, standing on her ladder, paints black checks quickly
          on the street in her mural. The stolen, portable television
          set sits in the corner, tuned into Action 13's coverage of
          the chaos in the street.

</b>          Rabbit running full-steam out of the village being pursued by

          its side in the road.

<b>          EXT. STREET. DAY
</b>
          Badger jumps out of the manhole and throws more blazing
          pinecones at farmers, trucks, parked cars, doors, windows,
          and the Action 13 camera crew. Seven farmhands chase him down
          a cobblestone lane.
          Weasel and Beaver climb out with straws in their paws and
          start firing blueberries toward the disoriented beagles. The
          beagles eat blueberries. They fall over. Eight farmhands
          chase Weasel and Beaver up a wooded path.
          Rickity, the field mouse, bounds out of the hole and leaps
          into the fracas. He fires a rubber band at Bunce off a
          paperclip. It snaps Bunce in the corner of his eye. Rickity
          lets out a little whoop.
          There is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from
          the manhole. Fox and Kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle
          with a tarp over it parked in front of Paddington Automotive.
          Fox whips off the tarp, revealing a miniature motorcycle with
          a sidecar.

          both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the
          distance. Kylie sinks lower in the sidecar. He shouts to Fox
          over the sound of the motor:

          Ash pokes his head up from the rear compartment of the
          sidecar. He also wears a helmet and goggles. His white cape
          flutters behind him. He shouts:

</b>          Where'd you come from again? How'd you
          get in the sidecar? I feel like I'm

          Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it
          slightly and fly over a little ditch. Ash yelps
          enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road.

          A pilot with a red moustache and a South African accent flies
          Bean's chopper. He wears a Bean, inc. patch on his shoulder.

          The Bean, inc. windmill spins briskly in the dusty winds.
          Shutters on the farmhouse bang open and shut. Leaves rustle
          on the branches of the apple trees. A few stray turkeys
          wander in the yard. A white-washed brick pile six stories
          tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its
          courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean
          Annex.
          The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters
          vegetables next to the driveway. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look out
          from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed-wire
          security barricade.

<b>                         FOX

          Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him vacantly. Fox says

          Kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw. The gardener
          puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his
          bicycle.
          Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come
          out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the
          gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park
          outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the
          motorcycle.

          Fox examines the card with mild resentment. He picks the lock
          and opens the doors.
          The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side,
          there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a
          compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted,
          broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest,
          fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle.
          White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily.
          Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck
          reads Spitz.
          Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens
          his eyes. Fox turns to Kylie.

<b>                         FOX

          Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and
          gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his
          hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points
          at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away
          and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly:

          some bags of fertilizer. It's reads:

          The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully:

</b>          Easy, boy.
          Fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle. He holds out the
          back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He says back over
          his shoulder to Kylie and Ash:

          Fox takes another step. He makes a soft, kissing noise. The
          beagle watches him calmly.

<b>                         FOX
</b>           Yes, I'm right. He's a good boy. A little
          lonely, maybe, but --
          Fox takes another cautious step.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          -- but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy.
          Is your name Spitz? That's German, isn't
          it?

          I thought he said you never look a beagle
          in the eye.

          Fox and the beagle lock eyes. The pupils of the beagle's eyes
          contract then completely disappear, and the whites turn
          bright red. Fox's eyes open wider than their sockets.
          The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an
          enraged maniac. His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie,
          and Ash shriek and scream, sprinting frantically around the
          courtyard as the rabid beagle, frothing, roaring, and
          snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox shouts, his
          voice cracking like a grandmother's:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Climb the trellis!
          In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis
          six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping
          off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof
          of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a
          pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look
          down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane
          fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the
          courtyard.
          Fox takes in their new surroundings. He says, pleased:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          So the attic is probably in the area
          right up around here somewhere, I figure,
          huh?
          Kylie and Ash, panting and dripping with sweat, both stare at
          Fox vacantly.
          (NOTE: a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating Kylie's
          vacant look will be used for Ash in this shot.)

          Bean's helicopter lands on top of the Nag's Head. Fires
          smolder and farmers continue to chase around after animals in
          the village streets below. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, leaning
          over and holding onto their hats, run to the chopper and
          climb inside. They take off.

          image of a trapped fox.
          An old man with a grey moustache and a young man with a black
          moustache, both dressed in orange-and-yellow-striped

          Kristofferson stands inside the apple crate leaning against
          the wall with his legs crossed and one arm akimbo with his
          hand on his hip. There is a clanking sound from above.
          Kristofferson looks up.
          A trap door in the ceiling creaks open. Fox, Kylie, and Ash
          look inside, down at Kristofferson. Kristofferson smiles
          oddly and says in a surprised, fancy-meeting-you-here voice:

          Ash holds the shoelace and keeps a paw behind his back like a
          mountaineer. His feet touch down on the shelf. He runs to the
          apple crate and jiggles the padlock. He hesitates. He says

          Kristofferson stands with his paws clasped in front of him.
          Ash mimics this.

          fourth one hangs behind St. John's Coin-op Laundry. A fifth

          Kristofferson closes his eyes. So does Ash. So do Fox and

</b>          First, you need to get a running start,
          which, obviously, I can't do in here,

          the chop --

</b>
<b>                         (IMMEDIATELY)
</b>          Got it.
          Ash walks ten paces away to the far end of the shelf. Fox and
          Kylie watch from above. Kylie says excitedly:

<b>                         KYLIE
</b>          He's going to do it!
          Fox makes a face that says, I'm not so sure. Ash takes a deep
          breath. He screams at the top of his lungs as he sprints
          toward the apple crate:

<b>

<b>

<b>                         ASH
</b>          Ki-ya!
          Ash's toe catches on a loose nail. He somersaults twice
          through the air and bounces off the side of the apple crate,
          which falls off the shelf.
          Kristofferson braces himself. The apple crate hits the floor
          and shatters into pieces. Kristofferson lies among the
          wreckage.
          Ash looks over the side of the shelf. Fox and Kylie watch
          from above, grimacing.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I'm sorry.

          unlock the apple crate.

</b>          No, I mean I'm sorry about --

<b>                         KRISTOFFERSON
</b>          (picking himself up)
          Oh, you mean from before. The apology you
          owed me which you never actually said.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          Yeah.
          Kristofferson nods sadly. He takes a deep breath. He nods
          again.

<b>                         KRISTOFFERSON
</b>          That's all right, too. Throw me the
          shoelace, please.
          Ash smiles.

</b>          Badger trapped in his cage. He hears something. He looks
          quickly down the alley. The old, orange van turns the corner
          and approaches, bumping over potholes. Badger shrinks into
          the corner of the cage and mutters grimly to himself:

<b>                         BADGER
</b>          Badoit et fils.

</b>          A cobblestone beside Badger suddenly drops straight down and
          disappears into the ground. Badger recoils, scared and
          confused.
          Mrs. Fox pokes her head up through the hole. She is beaded
          with perspiration and breathes heavily. Her fur is wildly
          dishevelled. She looks to the van driving up the alley. She
          looks to Badger. She extends her paw to him and says

<b>                         FIERCELY:

          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson come around the side of
          the building. They run to their motorcycle, outside the
          courtyard doors. They freeze.
          The front gates to the compound are closed and bolted. Bean's
          helicopter waits on top of the vegetable garden with its
          rotar-blades whirling. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand in front
          of Bean Annex with their weapons drawn.
          Fox sees his tail around Bean's collar. His eyes narrow. His
          jaw sets. He says to himself with growing emotion:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your
          posse hunted my family. Your gunmen
          kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my
          wife -- and you shot off my tail.

<b>                         (STEELY)
</b>          I'm not leaving here without that neck-
          tie.
          Bean smiles his sickly smile. Fox smiles back defiantly.
          Kylie looks utterly baffled. Ash says mystically:

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I weigh less than a slice of bread.

<b>                         FOX

</b>          What?

<b>                         ASH
</b>          I'll be right back.
          Ash runs. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson watch, shocked, as
          Ash sprints back to the courtyard doors. The three farmers
          open fire at him. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson duck and take
          cover behind a hay-bale.

</b>          Ash dodges bullets. He jumps off the balls of his feet with
          his arms out over a sprinkler-pipe and swings like a gymnast
          onto a clothesline, then flies through the air doing another
          of his spectacularly awkward four-armed and three-legged back-
          flips. He lands on the handle of one of the courtyard doors

<b>                         AND SCREAMS:
</b>
<b>                         ASH
</b>          Ki-ya!
          Ash cyclone-chops the doorknob. The lock clicks. Ash's eyes
          light up.
          Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and burrows into the
          dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through his
          nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw
          hanging open.
          The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears
          out into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and
          thrashing crazily. The farmers shriek and scream and run
          around, panicking, with their guns blazing.
          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their
          motorcycle. The beagle rips the tail from Bean's neck, shreds
          it, chews it up, and swallows it. Fox deflates for an
          instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash on the back of the
          motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox's waist. He
          says with the deepest affection and respect:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Ash, that was pure, wild animal
          craziness. You're an athlete.
          Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter.
          (NOTE: from this point onwards, an alternate version of Ash
          will be used which is slightly taller, slightly leaner, and
          animated slightly more gracefully.)
          Fox kick-starts the motorcycle and races across the farm.
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble onto the roof of a car port
          with an old, white Mercedes convertible under it. The
          snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as:
          Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the
          edge of the property. He guns the motor and yells:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Holy swearing cuss!!!

<b>

</b>          Fox races the motorcycle up the apple cart, into the air, and
          over the concrete barricade. They land in the middle of the
          road, skidding, and speed off down the hill.

</b>          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean watching from the roof of the car
          port. Boggis turns to Bean and says, deadpan, needling him:

<b>                         BOGGIS
</b>          Franklin? You got any final twist for
          this plot?

</b>
<b>                         (PAUSE)
</b>          Yeah!
          Bean grabs Boggis by the neck and throttles him. Bunce starts
          throwing punches. Bean holds him back by the forehead. Boggis
          kicks Bunce in the stomach. They brawl chaotically while the
          rabid beagle continues to go bananas below them.

</b>
          Mrs. Fox sits anxiously at the bottom of her ladder. Badger,
          Weasel, Rickity, the two small rabbits, and the others sit,
          exhausted, in the dark cavern, passing a jar of cider. Mole

</b>
<b>                         MOLE

          Everyone looks to Mole. Mole is holding the tin can with the
          string attached to it to his ear. He nods and says urgently:

<b>                         MOLE
</b>          I just intercepted a high-frequency radio
          signal with the can --

          pursued by the six farmhands. He comes to the manhole where
          they started and darts into it. The six farmhands stop at the
          manhole and look down. They go straight to the Nag's Head,
          walk inside, and close the door behind them.

<b>          EXT. ROAD. DAY
</b>
          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson ride down a country road.
          Kylie sees something across the meadow. He says warily:

<b>                         KYLIE
</b>          Don't turn around!

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What?
          Fox turns around. A huge, wild, grey wolf with ice-blue eyes
          stands on a rock fifty feet away from them. Fox slams on the
          brakes. The motorcycle slides to a halt.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Where'd he come from?

<b>                         (LOUDLY)
</b>          Where'd you come from? What are you doing
          here?
          Pause. Fox points toward the wolf:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Canis lupus!
          Fox points to himself:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Vulpes Vulpes!
          The wolf does not answer. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson
          watch idling from the motorcycle.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I don't think he speaks English or Latin.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          He doesn't seem to know.
          Silence. Fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his

<b>                         VOICE:
</b>
<b>                         FOX
</b>          I have a phobia of wolves!
          The wolf does not answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth
          open. Its teeth are long, sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs
          out, and its eyes are wild. Fox looks back at it with the
          identical expression for a minute, mesmerized -- then Fox
          closes his mouth and his eyes soften.
          Fox raises his paw in the air. The wolf blinks a few times.
          It raises its paw in the air. It turns away and trots off
          into the woods. Fox says wistfully:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck,
          boys.
          Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning
          tires, and they tear off down the road. The shot booms down
          into the ground, below the grass, through buried pebbles,
          layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits.

<b>                         TITLE:
</b>          THREE DAYS LATER (2 1/2 Fox Weeks)
          The shot continues to descend past Badger and his family
          having dinner in a nicely furnished drain-pipe, past Rabbit
          and his family watching Magnum, P.I. on the stolen, portable
          television set in a well-appointed cement tunnel, past Beaver
          and Mrs. Beaver hosting Mole and Weasel for cocktails in a
          tasteful sewer-conduit.
          The shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to the brick
          cavern. The walls are filled with electrical cables, wires,
          pipes, and a large, new mural which depicts the Fox's former
          view of the valley as seen from their tree with a trompe
          1'oeil window-frame around it. It is signed Felicity Fox.
          Ash and Kristofferson sit Indian-style meditating on a
          braided rug. Mrs. Fox works mixing paints and turpentine at
          an easel in the corner. There is an armchair with a folded-up
          copy of the Gazette on its cushion in the center of the room
          under a glowing lamp. Classical music plays on a radio.

</b>

          Everyone looks to Fox. He signals them to follow him.

          The cement conduit with the iron grating above it. Fox and
          his family walk briskly down the pipe. A knitted, woolen,
          artificial tail has been sewn into the seat of Fox's
          trousers.

<b>                         ASH

          Fox takes everyone through an opening and starts climbing a
          metal ladder. He says theatrically:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Let's see, now. Where does this lead?

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          Oh, no, Foxy. It's filthy.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Keep a good grip, everyone.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          This better be worth it.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          I think I see a little sliver of light.
          What's this? Is that a door?

<b>          MRS. FOX

</b>          Shh. I'm going to crack open this trap
          door and see if something's on the other
          side. I highly doubt it, though. There's
          probably just more sewer.
          Fox clears his throat. Pause.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          You know, wouldn't it be surprising if --

<b>                         ASH
</b>          Open it.
          Fox pushes open the trap door and crawls out. Everyone
          follows him.

<b>          INT. SUPERMARKET. NIGHT
</b>
          Fox and his family stand in the middle of an aisle at the
          center of a large grocery store. To their left is the
          refrigerated section of milk, eggs, meat, fish, and cheese.
          To their right are canned goods, breakfast cereal, laundry
          detergent, rice, pasta, and condiments. The lights are half-
          dimmed, and a metal grate is closed over the front windows.
          There are no people. Fox says casually:

<b>                         FOX
</b>          Hey, look! There's a whole, enormous,
          glorious, gigantic supermarket up here!
          Ash and Kristofferson seem dumbstruck. Fox raises an eyebrow
          and smiles at Mrs. Fox. She puts her arm around his shoulder.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          You really are kind of a quote-unquote
          fantastic fox.

          Kylie comes around the end of the aisle pushing a miniature
          shopping cart filled with jars of jelly, jam, olives,
          pickles, and honey, plus three loaves of bread, Band-Aids,
          toothpaste, and a carton of strawberry ice cream. He says

          Fox looks at Ash, who is studying a twelve-pack of tropical
          juice punch-boxes.

<b>                         FOX
</b>          The white cape rather suits him, doesn't
          it? Actually, I had to do quite a bit of
          searching myself before I found a look
          that really flattered me. Remember those
          horseshoe cuff-links?
          Fox and Mrs. Fox crack-up laughing. Fox notices something and
          stops. He stares at Mrs. Fox strangely. She is glowing. She
          hesitates. She shrugs.

<b>          MRS. FOX
</b>          I'm pregnant again.
          Fox is confused and moved. He holds Mrs. Fox's face in his
          paws. She smiles. Ash interrupts:

</b>          Fox and Mrs. Fox look to Ash. An empty punch-box lies on its
          side behind him with a straw sticking out of it. There is a
          huge, purple stain all over the front of his white shirt.

<b>                         ASH
</b>          Should we dance?
          Pause. Everyone breaks out giddily dancing an ecstatic jig.
          Kylie waltzes the cart in circles. Fox spins Mrs. Fox.

          with boxes, cartons, cans, bottles, bags, and jars of every

          dance at the distant end of the center aisle.

          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean sit silently in folding metal chairs
          around the manhole. Boggis's carbine rests across his lap.
          Bunce's shotgun hangs from a strap over his shoulder. Bean
          cleans his Luger. Petey sits on a cider box outside the Nag's
          Head strumming his guitar in the background. The bartender
          pulls the shutters shut and flips a sign on the door to
          Closed. Petey starts singing his song as the credits roll.
          The sun sets. The farmers sit waiting in the dark.
