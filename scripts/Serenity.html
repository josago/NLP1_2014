<b>          EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
          It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed.
          They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small
          wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The
          tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk
          about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.

<b>          GIRL
</b>          Now that the war's over, our
          soldiers get to come home, yes?

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Some of them. Some will be
          stationed on the rim planets as
          Peace Enforcers.

<b>          BOY
</b>          I don't understand. Why were the
          Independents even fighting us?
          Why wouldn't they look to be more
          civilized?

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          That's a good question. Does
          anybody want to open on that?

<b>          GIRL
</b>          I hear they're cannibals.

<b>          ANOTHER BOY
</b>          That's only Reavers.

<b>          ANOTHER GIRL
</b>          Reavers aren't real.

<b>          ANOTHER BOY
</b>          Full well they are. They attack
          settlers from space, they kill
          them and wear their skins and rape
          them for hours and hours --

<b>          TEACHER

<b>          (CALMER)
</b>          It's true that there are...
          dangers on the outer planets. So
          let's follow up on Borodin's
          question. With all the social and
          medical advancements we can bring
          to the Independents, why would
          they fight so hard against us?

<b>          RIVER
</b>          We meddle.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          River? 
          RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
          and "typing" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a
          long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
          columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is
          a good two years younger than the other kids.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          People don't like to be meddled
          with. We tell them what to do,
          what to think, don't run don't
          walk we're in their homes and in
          their heads and we haven't the
          right. We're meddlesome.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          (gently taking her

<b>          STYLUS)
</b>          River, we're not telling people
          what to think. We're just trying
          to show them how.
          She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead

<b>          INT. LAB - NIGHT
</b>
           And we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER
          sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one
          right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
          technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.
          The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.

<b>          2ND TECHNICIAN
</b>          She's dreaming.

<b>          FIRST TECHNICIAN
</b>          Nightmare?

<b>          2ND TECHNICIAN
</b>          Off the charts. Scary monsters.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight-
          drop.
          DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for
          that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied
          with himself.

<b>          4.
</b>          Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And
          making him a little nervous.
          The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates
          -- no
          substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton
          longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          See, most of our best work is done
          when they're asleep. We can
          monitor and direct their
          subconscious, implant
          suggestions...
          River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector
          starts forward, slowly.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          It's a little startling to see,
          but the results are spectacular.
          Especially in this case. River
          Tam is our star pupil.
          The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
          staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we
          will very soon learn, is SIMON.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          I've heard that.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          She's a genius. Her mental
          capacity is extraordinary, even
          with the side-effects.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          Tell me about them.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Well, obviously, she's unstable...
          the neural stripping gives them
          heightened cognitive reception,
          but it also destabilizes their own
          reality matrix. It manifests as
          borderline schizophrenia... which
          at this point is the price for
          being truly psychic.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          (moves toward her)
          What use do we have for a psychic
          if she's insane?

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          I don't have to tell you the
          security potential of someone who
          can read minds. And she has lucid
          periods -- we hope to improve upon
          the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to
          ask if there's some reason for
          this inspection.

<b>          SIMON
</b>
<b>          (TURNING)
</b>          Am I making you nervous?

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Key members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support for the
          project was unanimous. The
          demonstration of her power --

<b>          SIMON
</b>          (turns back to her)
          How is she physically?

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>           Like nothing we've seen. All our
          subjects are conditioned for
          combat, but River... she's a
          creature of extraordinary grace.

<b>          400
</b>
<b>          SIMON
</b>          Yes. She always did love to dance.
          He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.

<b>          ANGLE: THE BATON
</b>          As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),
          flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting
          forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
          flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.
          Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her
          head and swabs her, whispering:

<b>          SIMON
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          River. Wake up. Please, it's
          Simon. River. It's your brother.
          Wake up...
          She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
          out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic
          beneath.

</b>          River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          Simon.
          A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.

<b>          RIVER
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          They know you've come.

<b>          INT. GUARD STATION - CONTINUING

          As a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret
          service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls
          into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.

<b>          INT. RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING
</b>
          Simon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair
          of double doors.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          We can't make it to the surface
          from inside.
          Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at
          them from the other side of the doors.

          But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
          equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds
          herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and
          outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.
          The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing
          the lone orderly. Passing right under River.

<b>           EXT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a
          long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
          inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.
          They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his
          baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They
          fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.
          Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small
          patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky
          blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.

<b>          7.
</b>          ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
          the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.
          A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops
          down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It
          comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          Get on!
          He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
          right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.
          Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as
          the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up
          in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her
          holding one of the cables --

<b>           THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)
</b>          Stop.
          The action freezes.

<b>           THE OPERATIVE (0.S.)
</b>
<b>           (CONTINUING)
</b>          Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack.
          The action REVERSES, taking us back to the moment of Simon
          and River on the gurney just before it rises.

          There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
          he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.
          The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.
          He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a
          suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual
          wear. He is in:

<b>          INT. INSTITUTE RECORDS ROOM - DAY
</b>
          -- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic
          records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
          Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.
          The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.

          over one lens of the Operative's glasses.

</b>          Remarkable children.
          Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
          the opening) and a nervous young female intern following.
          Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Excuse me! No one is allowed in
          the records room without my
          express permission.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          (over this, quietly)
          Enter the doctor.
          (to Mathias)
          Forgive me. I prefer to see the
          event alone, without bias.
          Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          I need to see your clearance.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          You're right to insist. I know
          you've had security issues here.
          He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
          at the readout, and drops the bluster.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Apologies. An Operative of the
          Parliament will of course have
          full cooperation.
          (looks at screen)
          I'm not sure what... I see no
          listing of rank, or name.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          I have neither. Like this
          facility, I don't exist. The
          Parliament calls me in when...
          when they wish they didn't have
          to. Let's talk about the Tams.

          A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until

          ago and took her from you.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          It's not quite so simple.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          I'm very aware of that.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          He came in with full creds. He
          beat the ap-scan, the retinal...
          There was no way I could --

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          No, no. Of course. The boy spent
          his fortune developing the
          contacts to infiltrate this place.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Gave up a brilliant future in.
          medicine as well, you've probably

          whole life. Madness.

<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          It's love, in point of fact. He
          loved his sister and he knew she

          He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
          to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          Key members of Parliament have

          room with a psychic.

</b>          She was... she read cards, nothing
          more.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE

          River became much more unstable,
          more... disturbed, after you
          showed her off to Parliament. Did
          she see something very terrible in
          those cards?

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS

          their swords.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          (fed up)
          Well, unfortunately I forgot to
          bring a sword to --
          The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          The Parliament has no further
          interest in psychics. They
          represent a threat to the harmony
          and stability of our Alliance.

<b>          DOCTOR MATHIAS
</b>          I would put that down right now if
          I were you.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          Would you be killed in your sleep,
          like an ailing pet? Whatever your
          failings, I believe you deserve
          better than that.
          The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
          with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out
          his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent
          reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm.
          The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
          quietly as the first.
          Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He
          bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine.
          Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile.
          The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace
          for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and
          holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point
          tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror
          as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it.
          The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.

          to River Tam, and help her to come
          back to us. No matter how far out
          Simon has taken her, we can --
          He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame,
          slowed suddenly by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the
          Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him:

<b>          THE OPERATIVE

</b>          This is a good death. There's no

          We're making a better world. All
          of them, better worlds.
          Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the
          body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)

          The noise is sucked suddenly out of the room as we black out.

          the same in Chinese behind it.

<b>          EXT. SPACE, ORBITING THE MOON "LILAC" - DAY
</b>
          We move away from the ship. The name is on the nose, under
          the bridge. It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
          craning neck. The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines
          on either side and a giant glowing back. There are two small
          shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines. It's not
          the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure.
          As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she
          starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears. Camera comes
          around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see
          the Captain, MALCOLM 'MAL' REYNOLDS, standing and watching.
          At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
          flying past the window.

<b>          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
</b>
          [Note: the following sequence will take us through the ship
          in one extended STEADICAM shot.]
          The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
          tangle of wires and machinery all about.
          Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old
          Independent. Gun at his hip. He's not unlike the ship --
          he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at
          least, weathered. Right now, though, he's mostly startled.

<b>          MAL
</b>          What was that?
          He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian
          shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old
          soldier, but just as startled.

<b>          INT. FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING

          The camera leads Mal down. On either side of the hall are
          ladders leading down to crew's personal quarters.
          The hulking mercenary JAYNE is coming up out of his bunk as
          Mal passes. He carries a number of rifles and grenades.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          we're gonna explode? I don't
          wanna explode.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Jayne, how many weapons you plan
          on bringing? You only got the two
          arms...

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          I just get excitable as to choice,
          like to have my options open.

<b>          MAL
</b>          I don't plan on any shooting
          taking place during this job.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          Well, what you plan and what takes

          similar.

<b>          MAL
</b>          No grenades.
          (Jayne groans)
          No grenades.
          First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of
          dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          Are we crashing again?

</b>          We're robbing the place. We're

          All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the:

<b>          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING
</b>
          It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There
          is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from
          a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and
          sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor.

<b>          MAL
</b>          (calling out)
          Kaylee!
          He enters:

          Kaylee, what in the sphincter of

          The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine
          room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks
          and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes
          Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the
          doorway, raising his voice above the din.

          He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned
          than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in
          dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed.

<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to

          Simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs.

          They enter the biggest space on the ship. Giant doors sit at
          the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering
          ramp. Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to
          the foredeck hall. We've come all the way through Serenity.

</b>          Things get gritty I will keep her
          from the fray, but she's coming.
          Best you get her ready.
          As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man
          hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne and
          Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it.

          The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on
          the catwalk, and track with them to find:

          She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose
          summer dress draped over her small frame.

          The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship.
          The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to

          It's okay to leave them to die.
          River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.

<b>          RIVER
</b>          I'm the brains of the operation.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          We should hit town right during

          crowds.

<b>          MAL
</b>          If Fanty and Mingo are right about
          the payroll, this could look to be
          a sunny day for us.

<b>          SIMON

<b>          (APPROACHING)

<b>          MAL
</b>          Doctor, I'm taking your sister
          under my protection here. If
          anything happens to her, anything
          at all, I swear to you I will get
          very choked up. Honestly. There
          could be tears.
          He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...

<b>          KAYLEE
</b>          Don't mind the Captain none,
          Simon. I know he'll look out for
          her.

<b>          SIMON
</b>          It's amazing. I bring River all
          the way out to the raggedy edge of
          the 'verse so she can hide from
          the Alliance by robbing banks.

<b>          KAYLEE
</b>          It's just a little Trading
          Station. They'll be back 'fore

<b>          EXT. LILAC - DAY
</b>
          We see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in.
          The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood
          mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build
          with. Right now the streets are mainly empty.

<b>          EXT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING
</b>
          The mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak:

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          What are we hoping to find here
          that equals the worth of a turd?

<b>          MAL
</b>          Alliance payroll. There's peace
          enforcing squads stationed all
          about this quadrant. Can't use
          credits out here -- they got to
          pay their boys in cashy money.
          Which once a month rests here.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          Something about stealing from the
          Alliance just warms a body like
          whiskey in winter.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          (cocks his gun)
          Shiny. Let's be badguys.
          Mal turns back to River.

<b>          MAL
</b>          You ready to go to work, darlin'?

<b>          RIVER

<b>          MAL

          Right. Great. Let's go.

</b>          The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following
          and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking.
          Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with
          "Welcome to Lilac" on it for the millisecond before it's
          blown to bits.
          There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers,
          farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination
          post-office, general store, bank, and most other things.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Hands and knees and heads bowed
          down! Everybody, now!
          Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others.
          Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks.
          Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very
          much new in design.
          The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
          great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right
          upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! --
          bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.

<b>          MAL
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          Y'all wanna be looking very
          intently at your own belly
          buttons. I see a head start to
          rise, violence is gonna ensue.
          The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else.
          Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty
          shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          Looks like this is the place.
          He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front
          door. She does, and River steps in.
          ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched-
          over customers as Mal addresses them.

<b>          MAL
</b>          You've probably guessed we mean to
          be thieving here, but what we are
          after is not yours. So let's have
          no undue fussing.
          As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
          finding the small vault locked.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          She's locked up.
          River suddenly looks around, perturbed.
          CLOSE ON: a young tough.
          River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
          young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt.
          He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          You know what the definition of a
          hero is? It's someone who gets
          other people killed. You can look
          it up later.
          He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.
          Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him
          toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow.

<b>          TRADE AGENT
</b>          This is just a crop moon, don't
          think you'll find what you --

</b>          The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall
          safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive.
          Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.

<b>          ZOE
</b>          At last. We can retire and give
          up this life of crime.
          Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
          hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming
          metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal
          addresses the Trade Agent.

</b>          Is there a fed down there? Be
          truthful.

          The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.

<b>          GUARD (O.S.)
</b>          You have to give me your
          authorization password!
          Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into
          the hole. A beat...

          Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:

<b>          INT. VAULT - CONTINUING
</b>
          Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets. A
          short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is
          already opening. Behind that door, a few bags of the real
          deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed.

<b>          INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING

          We move in on River as something crosses her face. Worry.

<b>          EXT. TOWN - DAY

          A WOMAN carrying a bucket and her nine year old SON are
          looking at the trading station a few buildings away.

          Mostly. He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self-
          mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning. His

          Zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the

</b>
<b>          EXT. TRADING STATION - DAY

          The doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal
          behind with River in hand. She is freaked, in her own space.
          Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on --

<b>          MAL
</b>          Zoe take the wheel --

<b>          JAYNE

          1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands
          River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly
          moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon
          bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule.

<b>          YOUNG MAN

<b>          MAL
</b>          It's too many. Drive, Zoe.
          A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size
          of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded
          conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator,
          pure. It disappears over the rooftops.

          Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors
          it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust.
          As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows
          and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun.
          He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back.
          Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the
          chest, slumps down dead.

<b>          ANGLE: THE EDGE OF TOWN
</b>          As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff
          shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street,
          right abreast of our gang.

<b>          ANGLE: THE CENTER OF TOWN
</b>          We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
          come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines
          to swarm into it.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING

          The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain.
          The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic
          fire and it swings away. There is sporadic return fire.

<b>          JAYNE
</b>          How come they ain't blowing us out
          of the air?

<b>          MAL

</b>          As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of
           the sky, bay doors open, and comes right up behind it -- The
          Mule swallowed by the bigger ship --

<b>          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
</b>
           And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as
           it flies backwards into the bay, narrowly missing Simon and
           smashing back into the staircase, sparks and people flying --

          Serenity tries to get altitude -- but slams right into the
          oncoming skiff, tearing it apart --

          A flaming portion of the top flies in, skids to the floor as
          small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a
          lever and jets of C02 shoot out of the floor.
          Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing, then
          runs to the mule. The C02 stops and he finds River sitting
          in her seat, completely unharmed. Zoe is climbing painfully
          out of the other seat, Mal and Jayne both having been thrown.

          A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top.
           He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth --
           Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe
           both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go
           down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op.

          We're close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused
          exasperation. Behind her is an opulently dressed little
          shuttle.

<b>          INARA

          Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the

          And here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes

          that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in
          saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved
          heads in the back, also on their knees.
          Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She
          speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
          repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her
          the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step.

          a common whore. It's unsafe.

<b>          SHEYDRA

          We start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report. On the
          screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed, now half of it
          a smoking ruin.

</b>          that it was a band of Reavers
          remains unconfirmed. The only
          survivors of the massacre
          apparently locked themselves in
          the Trade Station vault until --

</b>          During this we come around to see that the screen has a
          blinking light behind it, come THROUGH the wiring of the back
          to look out at the bar, with the word "recording" in the
          corner. Every screen is a camera, even down here.

<b>          40
</b>          We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting
          away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories
          straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and
          booths and a second screen playing in the corner.

<b>          MAL
</b>          It's not my fault the Doc's got no
          stomach for Rim living --

<b>          KAYLEE
</b>          It is entirely and for all your
          fault! If you'd given Simon a
          moment, just a moment where he
          didn't think you were gonna throw
          them off or turn them in, he
          might've --

</b>          What? Swept you into his cleanly
          arms? Made tidy love to you?
          They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have
          already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat:
          Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the
          q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A
          large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.

          those two. And how do you know
          what he feels? He's got River to
          worry on but he still coulda shown

</b>          Tell that to Inara.
          For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react. Kaylee storms out.

          MINGO is young, tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a
          fur-trader. Sounds lower-class British, or something like it.

          FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is
          Mingo's identical twin. Apart from slight differences in
          dress, they are indistinguishable.

          They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a
          few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance...
          ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently
          blocked by her little dance.
          Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.

          Jayne sees her, nudges Mal, who looks and turns back to
          business. We stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter
          of the bar, vaguely listening in on Mal's deal.

          This is all background noise to River, who has moved to the
          CV screen, on which is a commercial. It's animated, goofy,
          cartoon animals and anime-style Asian girls all transforming
          to insane fantasy figures as they sing about:

          EXTREME CLOSE UP, all noise but the jingle fading out,
          finally that as well, just the hum in River's ears.
          And she whispers:

<b>          RIVER
</b>          Miranda.
          She turns and looks back at the crowd.
          What happens next happens very fast.
           She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
          quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips
           it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as --
           people are turning, just registering that this girl --
          kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a
          bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her
          square in the face, a man she never even looked at -- people
          are rising, fleeing or pushing forward --

          She's taking out a group of four, high kicks and perfect
          precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out
          a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above
          her head, using his momentum to stab the other one --
          Mal fights to get back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches
          her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on
          Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
          the rod at her head, knocks her cold...
          She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using
          the room itself to take out every single person there. One
          man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg
          around the corner and nails his face.
          Jayne grabs her from behind --

</b>
<b>          (CONTINUING)
</b>          Gorrammit, girl, it's me!
          She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she
          spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm,
          V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching
           of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table --
          Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to
          scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --
          Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
          knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and
          then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with
          his, they are pointed right at each other --

<b>          SIMON
</b>          Eta Kooram Nah Smech!
          And River drops to the ground, fast asleep.
          There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon,
          who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing.
          He looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.

</b>          I want to resolve this like
          civilized men. I'm not
          threatening you. I'm unarmed.

<b>          MAL
</b>          Great!
          He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
          Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway.
          The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          I am of course wearing full body
          armor. I'm not a moron.
          He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
          blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts,
          but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds.
          Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative
          kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets
          to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose
          dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.

<b>          MAL
</b>          No back up? We're making an awful
          ruckus...

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          They'll come when they're needed.

<b>          MAL
</b>          I'd start whistling.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          Captain, what do you think is
          going to happen here?
          They come at each other. The Operative is the much better
          trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.

</b>          Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's
          precision is wearing Mal down.
          Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
          V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara,
          breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara
          places her hand on his arm.
          The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out
          his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of
          fascination as he looks at it.

</b>          He's not the plucky hero. The
          Alliance isn't some evil empire.
          This isn't the grand arena.

<b>          INARA
</b>          And that's not incense.
          He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like
          a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound.

<b>          40
</b>          It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything
          goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz.
          The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
          soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and
          Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!

          Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps
          and along a corridor. The sound is still tinny and weird.

          Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to
          see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by
          V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking
          grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at
          the foursome.
          CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
          one by one, counting down --

</b>          Grenade!
          Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara
          race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as
          the last light goes out and nothing happens.
          One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the
          door shuts on him and Inara.

          The shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out.

          Inara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the
          controls. Mal is gone.

          all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different

          and burns away from us.

          The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in
          the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle-
          holes in her head -- makes her way through them.
          Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen. On it is
          the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and
          planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes
          in to one system, one planet...
          She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see:

<b>          INT. LAB - CONTINUING

          Her POV is of the lab. There stand some five older men in
          formal dress. They stare at her, impassive.
          We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city
          streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face --

          As Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs.

</b>          He's intelligent, methodical and

<b>          INARA
</b>          I honestly think the only reason

          The group make their way toward the bridge. Those close
          enough to get a view out the window are looking freaked --
          those already on the bridge are stock still. Pressed up

          The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a
          vague cluster, as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them.
          Most of them hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly
          about. Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around.

          It's small -- landing is easier in cities with flying
          vehicles. At the end of a short runway, tipped and damaged,
          is an Alliance Research Vessel. The gang makes its way
          towards it.

          River pulls away from Simon, suddenly determined. She
          approaches a console, and a small cylindrical object. She
          turns it slightly --
          A hologram squawks to life amidst them all. First we see
          images that resemble the flashes from River's mind: Corpses,

          There's been no war here, and no

          We are amongst the Reaver armada. Serenity slices quietly
          through the ships, as we come around and see Miranda receding
          in the distance.
          Serenity drifts through the armada -- and suddenly another
          ship fires up, running next to her...
          The two ships pace each other, another vessel coming about as
          though staring at Serenity, who comes closer and closer to
          frame, till we see the suited corpse draped on the cannon.
          It suddenly moves: it's Mal.
          He swings the cannon round and fires at the ship pacing them.
          It BLOWS, fragmenting into burning bits that spiral into
          other ships, causing two smaller ones to blow as well.

          Serenity slips right under the Operative's ship and ducks and
          weaves between dozens more. The Reaver force hits the
          Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that, smashing
          into bigger ships kamikaze-style, everything exploding --
          The fleet mobilizes, blasting Reaver ships, circling around,

          spinning, explosions popping silently all over it.

          slowing, fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it
          goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian

          to go helpless on us.

          Jayne and I take the first wave.
          Nobody shoots less they get past

          Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell. The bangs on
          the door continue.

<b>          KAYLEE
</b>          Oh, I didn't plan on going out
          like this. I think we did right,
          but...

<b>          SIMON
</b>          I never planned... anything. I
          just wanted to keep River safe.
          Spent so much time on Serenity
          trying to find us a home I never
          realized I already had.

          Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than
          we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the door.

<b>          KAYLEE
</b>          Hell with this. I'm gonna live.
          Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the
          door.
          Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth:
          a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace.

          A panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the Operative drops
          down, having clearly entered from a different location.
          He looks around, carrying a laser-pistol. He moves past Mr
          Universe and Lenore --

          Mal has reached it and surveys the situation.
          Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the
          generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and
          grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it.
          On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console
          sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains
          run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs.

          The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to
          squeeze through and charge.
          Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard
          as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward
          the door --

          each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo.
          The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the
          precision of military training still in her as she flips him,
          wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame,
          bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open
          and she's rushed from behind ---

          comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a
          blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in
          his neck.
          Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly.

<b>          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - LATER

          Mal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the
          ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong
          move and he pitches into the jaws of death...
          A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs
          sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the
          backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he
          falls, mercifully, back onto the platform.
          The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot
          as Mal gets shakily up.

          master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets
          two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover.

          The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out
          at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover.
          Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts
          going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can.
          The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's
          been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death
          in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and
          grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.
          He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
          4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
          Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and
          pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes
          swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
          He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
          the platform from above.

          squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoe's
          shirt, checks the wound.

          River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and
          starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like
          projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the
          projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as
          Zoe shouts:

          Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor.
          Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close, from
          each side and above and below. Then, when the hole is maybe
          four by four, they stop.

          and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything

          lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
          right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air.
          River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make.
          Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs
          cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it.

          She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES
          through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name,
          the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
          lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers.
          Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets
          the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the
          back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of
          Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second
          her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her.
          The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm
          over her.

<b>          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          Mal gets up the chain to the platform. The Operative is on
          Mal before he gets his footing, tackles him as Mal's gun goes
          skittering over the edge into oblivion. There is a railing
          here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with
          a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him.
          They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest,
          knocking over tools and computer parts.
          The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
          gracefully from the holster under his jacket.
          Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver.
          He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets
          inside sword range and tries for the neck with the
          screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword
          point against the edge of Mal's stomach. Starts pushing
          slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin.

</b>          You know what your sin is, Malcolm?

          He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so
          hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The
          Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the
          screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it,
          gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck
          in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin.
          The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword
          still in his belly.

<b>          MAL

          He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls
          out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground and is up in a
          second, grabbing Mal's sword hand -- the sword drops -- and
          punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound.

          Mal goes down hard, spitting up blood. He sees the sword,
          moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face. Picks him
          lod up, Mal too tired to throw a decent punch.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          I'm sorry.
          The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right
          into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias
          with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain.
          The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword.
          Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.

          He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way,
          grabbing the Operative's swordhand and pulling it forward --
          while driving his elbow into the Operative's neck with
          staggering force.

          unable to make a sound.
          Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own
          through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
          arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we
          hear his arms crack.

          He hits "send all". The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
          V0 begins. Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on
           the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative.
           There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the
           street, in homes and offices... image after image, jus.t as
           we saw on the research vessel -- and in River's mind.

          Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other
          side. He begins to cross. Never even looks back.
          On the Operative, trapped, watching in growing horror...

          CLOSE ON: A Reaver in EXTREME SLOW MOTION. Face full of
          fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate.
          And a small hand smashes that face so hard that teeth fly --
          the Reaver clearing frame to reveal:

          She is bloodied, but not killed. She's as she was in the
          bar -- moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can,
          ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are
          piles of Reavers already, she never breaks concentration as
          she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does
          everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
          above -- the mob.
          She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
          and a grappling hook punches through it, just missing her.

<b>          INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING

          The Operative watches the end of the broadcast. We are on
          his face through the clear plastic, so the images projected
          on it blur right before him: the Reaver, Dr. Caron -- and her
          screaming doesn't stop til something is shoved in her mouth.

<b>          INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUING

          The gang is still trying to patch themselves together when
          the elevator doors open. Mal staggers out, holding his
          bleeding side.

          Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a
          report -- and the doors start to open behind her.
          Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons,
          as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
          reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver
          blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive.
          We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped
          completely away.
          Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
          wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance
          soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang...

          vp INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
          The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com:

          a kill order? Do we have an order?

<b>          EXT. DESERT PLANET - SUNSET
</b>
          We are close on a gravestone. It is rounded, looks more like
          a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into
          the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but
          glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of
          those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his
          lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
          stone beneath.
          The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone,
          40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial
          Book.
          The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash.
          The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses
          a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
          instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper
          to it is River.
          She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're
          flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves),
          Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
          with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side.
          There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing.
          Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown,
          holding a burning taper.
          She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to
          the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others.
          The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch
          its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series
          of fireworks.

          We are close on another explosion when it becomes:

<b>          EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY

          Zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship, welding on a
          replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash
          came through.

<b>          INT. DUCT INSIDE SERENITY - DAY

          We are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just
          above the engine room, replacing wires. Some of them run to
          a computer screen that she checks and adjusts.

          Mal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it
          off the top of the ship.

          repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly.

          Kaylee, deeply greasy, tweaks a part on the engine and
          crosses to the back where Simon, shirtless and not entirely
          ungreasy himself, is wrenching a bolt into place above his
          head. A moment looking at him and she can't help herself -
          she slides her arms around his chest...

          On a scaffold, Inara repaints the name on the nose with
          elegant precision.

          Kaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends, work
          completely forgotten. With nothing resembling elegant
          precision, they sink out of frame to the floor.

          It's raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair
          equipment. The camera moves around him, skirting the ground
          of the junkyard, till it lands on a figure in foreground,
          standing watching him from some twenty feet away.
          Mal stops, doesn't turn. Hand near his gun.

          The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the
          ship, framed by the rain behind.

<b>          THE OPERATIVE
</b>          Do you know what an uproar you've

          .nothing left to see.
          Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head
          inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops
          to look up at the nose of the ship.
