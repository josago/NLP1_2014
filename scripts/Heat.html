</b><b>EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY
</b>
A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on
Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries
a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight
years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and
hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were
spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language
is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very
good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your
problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's
no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps
it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
flat.

<b>ANGLE
</b>
Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white
intern's coat from his paper bag.

<b>INT. CEDARS-SINAI CORRIDOR - TRAVELING TWO SHOT - DAY
</b>
We DOLLY on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded
corridor. Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by.
A P.A. broadcasts occasional messages.

<b>PROFILE
</b>
Nail crosses under an "EMERGENCY" sign and keeps going
towards the exit doors.

<b>TRAVELING - FRONTAL
</b>
Neil APPROACHES THE CAMERA. From the other direction two
ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and
pass by Neil.

<b>WIDE REAR SHOT
</b>
Without breaking his stride from the moment he got off the
bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances
parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off. Maybe
he's stolen it. We don't know.

<b>EXT. R & C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY
</b>
CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement
with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat
over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless
sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,
Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction
worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.
He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline
pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.
Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley
were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to
1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and
spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and
the Clerk exit to the sales counter.

<b>INT. "TOYS 'R' US STORE" - ON CERRITO - DAY
</b>
MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house.
He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian
from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and
Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his
natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns
and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else
for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest
guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his
way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked
him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you
were talking about.

<b>CLOSE OR DOLL HOUSE DETAILS
</b>
It's 3 x 6 and two feet high. Miniature room sets are
inside. Cerrito's thick fingers close the door. He picks
it up. WIDEN. He crosses to a counter and MIDDLE-AGED

He combs his long hair straight back off his round forehead.
Now he tucks his shirt in and puts on wrap around shades.

Towner is near death, beaten to a pulp. Something or

Neil uses his penlight. He puts a towel under Towner's
head. Towner's face - against the white octagonal tile

            be. But if you don't betray
            Chris, you betray Dominick.
            Because he becomes an orphan
            when you go to prison as an
            accessory 'cause you got no living
            parents to take him. Then he
            ends up state-raised and fucked
            for life. Your son Dominick's
            innocent. He didn't choose a
            life like that. Chris did.

Charlene rises and crosses to a bedroom and looks in the
door - presumably at Dominick.

Charlene sits - shell-shocked - dressed in black with white
face and red lipstick. Marciano re-enters with a drink
for her.  Charlene looks towards the bedroom containing
Dominick, then nods her head "yes." Farina dials a number.

          Three teams are moving up the

          of commission because of the

For some reason Hanna's disinterested. He's moving down a
different track. He's cruising the streets looking for
something else.

Neil's   on the ground, his back against the rack. One arm

Neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. Hanna still
grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at
the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. The two of
them stay there like that.
