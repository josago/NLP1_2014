<b>          INT. COLLEGE DORM ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm
          room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting
          patiently for this year's kids.
          A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun,
          right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe.

<b>          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          OVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS.
          They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting.

<b>          EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
</b>
          SARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm.
          She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just
          above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic.
          No parents.
          She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the
          other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring
          through the building's window at...
          Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their
          parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces.

<b>          INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY
</b>
          Sara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT
          smiles up at her.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Hi. Sara Matthews.
          She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple
          silver chain around her neck.

<b>          R.A.
</b>          Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover
          country.
          She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely.

<b>          R.A.
</b>          You're in room three-sixteen.
          Welcome.
          She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling.

<b>          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she...
          Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down
          the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps
          into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off.
          Sara stops in front of Room 316.

<b>          INT. DORM DOORWAY - DAY
</b>
          She opens the door and looks in on:
          A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the
          hall; twin beds. Heaven.
          Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice
          here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window.
          She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here.
          First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her
          duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a
          YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara.
          Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart.
          It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Told you we'd make it.
          She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off
          the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles
          off the other cart.

<b>                         GIRL
</b>          Sorry! Bad driver.
          Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --
          clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And
          peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl
          smiles sheepishly.

<b>          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY
</b>
          A gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it
          all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on
          the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm
          windows.

<b>          EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
          Sara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met
          this really cool biker? He's taking
          me to Mexico this weekend.

</b>          Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding.
          Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a
          work/study ad on the wall.

<b>                         SARA

          She tears a tab off the flyer.

<b>          INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Sara's half-settled in now. The wall beside her bed is
          peppered with fashion pages ripped out of Vogue and In Style.
          She sits in a lounge chair, paging through a Vanity Fair
          photo shoot. She spots a cool outfit and tears out the page.
          A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Sara walks over. She opens it
          expectantly to see...

          and wait for my roommate.
          Groans all around. "Come on"... "Lame-O"... Sara bites her
          lip, considering. She smiles.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Alright. Just let me change.
          The girls cheer.

<b>          EXT. PSI U. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
           Establishing shot of a proud frat house. Students piled on a
           giant porch and there's a long line going up the steps to the
          front door. Music blasts out of the windows.

<b>          INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          Sara, Tracy, Kim and the others from the floor are at the
          head of the line, stepping into the house. They're met by a

<b>          FRAT BOUNCER.
</b>
<b>                         BOUNCER

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          For a frat party?! Seriously?
          He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim
          steps around him.

<b>                         KIM
</b>          I don't drink anyway.
          Tracy looks at her, mouth agape.

          He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is
          around it.
          Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          Come on, just us. We won't tell.
          The bouncer is tempted but not budging.

<b>                         BOUNCER
</b>          Honestly, I'm just a pledge.
          They'll kick me out.
          She stomps by him.

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          Wuss.
          Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          You want something to drink?

<b>                         SARA
</b>          What's the point?
          Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking
          extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard.
          Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage,
          but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large
          room.
          A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good,
          but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and
          watches them. In particular --
          THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's
          mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara
          chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He
          definitely stands out.
          Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in
          with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band.
          Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the
          wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          6.

          Why aren't you dancing?

<b>                         SARA
</b>          To this?

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          They're not that bad.
          Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start
          jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as
          Tracy chugs her drink.

<b>          INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER
</b>
          A DJ rules the room now. Sara and Kim are dancing with
          others from the floor. Sara notices a speck of punch on her
          shirt. She stops dancing. Wets her fingers and tries to rub
          it out.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Crap.
          Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Where's Tracy?

<b>                         KIM
</b>          She was getting more punch.
          Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing
          onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other
          girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively,
          egging on the crowd.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Uh oh.
          Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera
          phones stretch out above the crowd.

</b>
<b>                         (SHOUTS)
</b>          Tracy.
          Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the
          stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the
          bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd.

          Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who
          inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara
          gasps.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Damn!
          Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd.
          Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Oh. Woops.

<b>                         SARA

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Looks like my plan backfired.
          Sara turns back towards him.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          What plan?

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          To spill beer on you so I can start
          a conversation.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          You spilled beer on me purposely?

          She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's
          hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a
          dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          I'll get over it.
          He laughs, making her smile.

          Stephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of
          the punch.

<b>                         SARA

          She drinks some more.

</b>          It doesn't taste that strong.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Exactly.
          He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of
          hers.

          Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs,
          grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her,
          bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that
          he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her

          behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing,
          Holding up a cup of punch.

          Kim shrugs.

          Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which
          Stephen notices.

          They spot Tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom
          of the stairs. Sara rushes over to her. A couple frat boys
          stand over her. Not sure what to do with her.

          looks and Sara's balance is not so great, herself. The frat
          boys notice her struggling.

          But Stephen's there to catch her.

          wears a jacket Stephen gave her for the walk. Kim and
          ANOTHER GIRL step forward and grab Tracy.

          suddenly makes her a little more queasy.

          Sara heads for her room, holding onto the wall as she goes.
          She reaches her door. She takes one more deep breath, then
          opens it.

          She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing
          hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may
          puke at any second.
          She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her
          bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing:
          The other bed.
          Sara screams.

          No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it,
          and turns toward the wall.

          to sleep.

          Sara wakes. Headache; dry mouth; the works. The sun through
          the window is way too bright. She slowly turns over to see...
          Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the
          light of day, we see that she's a knockout.
          Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that
          flank an awesome stereo system.

          to her side.
          Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various
          self-portraits of Rebecca. Sara looks at one where Rebecca
          is staring straight back at us. No smile.

          your favorite designers. Marc
          Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens.
          Magicians, right? I've got news for

          Sara is now dancing by herself. A GUY moves in on her, but
          she politely dances away. She scans the dance floor for
          Tracy. Where'd she go?
          She steps off the dance floor and scans the bar -- no sign of
          her.

          Sara walks into the crowded ladies' room.

<b>          EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

          A bummed Sara walks out of the club alone. She rubs her arms
          against the chill. She nervously tugs on her silver chain as
          she scans the STRAGGLERS loitering outside.

<b>                         SARA
</b>

          She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against
          hope that Tracy will magically appear. No luck.
          She starts walking down the street, away from the club.
          Weary and unnerved.

<b>          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Rebecca lies in bed, wide awake in the dark. Her cell phone
          rings. She stares at it. Two more rings. She picks it up.

          She smiles.

<b>          EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
          An old school gas station on a barren corner of the city. No
          cars in either direction. A lone white 328i BMW with a black
          soft top sits next to an ancient pump.
          Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle,
          sticking it in the fuel tank. Starts pumping.

<b>          MAN (0.S.)
</b>          Can I help you out?
          She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station
          attendant. His name tag: "Rick".
          Rebecca sizes him up.

</b>          I'm fine. Just in a hurry.
          She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her,
          treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the
          "Full Service" sign.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Just doing my job.
          She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the
          gas pump and squeezes. She looks down at his hand on top of
          hers. Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          All done.
          She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it
          back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          You have a little something.
          No, she doesn't.
          He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her
          cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back.

<b>                         RICK (CONT'D)

          His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle.

</b>          Sorry.
          But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him
          head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range.

<b>                         REBECCA (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry again. Rick.
          The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every
          direction. She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter.
          Rick's pissed. Charges towards her.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          You spoiled c---
          He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She
          absentmindedly flicks it. It sparks but doesn't light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          29.
</b>          The gas is now pouring towards him. The meter on the pump is
          still ticking up.
          He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him
          and drops the still pouring nozzle.
          A hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls
          out a loose hundred dollar bill. Places it on top of the
          pump.

<b>                         REBECCA

          She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in
          gasoline.

<b>          INT./EXT. DINER - NIGHT
</b>
          Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup
          of hot, sobering coffee.
          Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights
          shine right in Sara's eyes... and now turn off.
          Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the
          car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for
          the door.

          Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          These are the modern pieces. A
          little wilder than the old stuff.
          She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't
          just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed.
          Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: "Jason".
          She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She
          buries her cell phone in her purse.
          Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it.

          Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the
          background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince
          exhibition.

          Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her
          smock.

<b>                         REBECCA

          Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants
          Sara to like this painting.
          Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what
          Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is
          actually pretty sinister.
          Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's
          hopeful expression. Sara brightens.

<b>                         SARA

          Sara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores.
          Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor.
          Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes.

          that she's serious.

<b>                         REBECCA

          Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over

          Rebecca takes down a few of her drawings. In their place, she
          puts up a big "Coyote Ugly" poster. She straightens it out.
          Satisfied.
          She checks her watch and walks to the window. She looks out,
          anxious for Sara to come home.
          She looks over at Sara's side of the room. Curious, she
          starts perusing her things. Books... CDs...
          She walks to Sara's dresser and picks up the picture of
          Emily. She tenderly brushes Emily's face with her thumb.
          She spots Sara's silver chain. She picks it up and places it
          around her neck. She fingers it carefully and looks at

          Sara looks in-between the columns outside the dorm and finds
          a STRAY KITTEN. She's cute as they come, a black-and-white

</b>          I named her in the elevator.
          Cuddles.
          She smiles and scoops her up. Suddenly, her smile vanishes.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Is that my necklace?
          Rebecca touches it. She'd forgotten she still had it on.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Sorry. I was just trying it on.
          Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly
          takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it
          protectively.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          This was my sister's.

</b>          Oh.
          Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          You can borrow anything of mine.
          Except for this. Okay? It's the
          only thing I kept of hers.
          Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her.

</b>
          A cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy
          couches. More like a living room than a coffee shop. Lots of
          laid-back STUDENTS and...
          One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now
          rushing back to the register for the next order. Her CO-

          The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some
          ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the
          lid, and...
          THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her
          apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands
          her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find...
          STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line.

          Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She
          watches Tracy and Sara.
          Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs.

          Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder,
          she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile.
          Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca
          takes it.

          She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her

          She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door.
          Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the
          full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the
          mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced.
          She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the
          skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation...
          SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood
          trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with
          her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear.

          Her eyes glowing in the dark. Creepy. But not as creepy as...
          Rebecca in the other bed. She's staring back at the kitten.
          Envy in her eyes. Of Cuddles... or of Sara?
          Rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed. She
          walks over to Sara's bed... but not to pet Cuddles. She
          stands directly above Sara. Looking down at her. If Sara

          comprehend her. A beat. She stands... and walks to her.
          Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose
          demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes.
          She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca
          turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and

          Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from

          artists are rushing around, dragging thousands of dollars
          worth of dresses. Sara loves the place's chaotic energy.
          She knocks on an open door and sees a YOUNG MODEL being
          worked on by a designer who isn't much older. IRENE, 28.

          Irene is putting a dress together on a MODEL. Sara watches in

          nods his approval... and leaves.

          She hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste.
          She removes the towel and steps into the shower, pulling the
          curtain closed. As she shampoos her hair...
          The lights go out.

</b>          You have to be kidding me. Hey!
          The only light is some distorted moonlight through the
          window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel.
          Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall...
          The lights come back on. She sighs happily... sheds her
          towel... and steps back under the steaming water. A beat.
          The lights go off again.

</b>          Goddammit !
          She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now... one

          Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along
          the wall again. She turns on the lights.
          The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers.
          Tracy stares at them. A beat.

</b>          I know it's you.
          She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one
          curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns
          it off. She stares at the other curtain.

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          Sara thinks you're weird. She told
          me.
          She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off
          that shower, too. But she can still hear running water.
          She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed
          again. The sound of running water behind it.
          She walks over.

          She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the
          curtain open to see...
          Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around --
          no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the
          water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower.

          Just as the warm water starts to relax her...
          THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca.
          The curtain comes right off the rings.
          Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor
          hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both.

          the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down.
          Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca.

<b>                         REBECCA

          if you tell anyone about... what
          I'm about to do... you'll regret
          it.
          Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other
          hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further.
          Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she
          needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain.
          A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face.
          Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor,
          Rebecca looks down at...
          The bloody ring in her hand.

<b>                         REBECCA

          She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But
          the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara.
          She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her

          Rebecca. He's about to pull it out and reveal her. But it's
          not the right one. He keeps walking.
          He reaches the end of his aisle... and Rebecca the end of
          hers. She's right around the corner from him. He reads the
          markers at the end of the aisle, trying to figure out which
          direction to go.
          Rebecca's hands are sweaty. She's nervous. Does she want to
          get caught? Stephen turns right, away from her, and starts
          down the next aisle.
          Rebecca softly exhales. And now whispers to herself.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Stephen.
          Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He
          keeps going, scanning the book numbers again.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Shit, wrong aisle.
          He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's...
          EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance.

          checks his watch.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Should we head back home?
          They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide,
          jungle gym, etc.

          fall. She then lets go, victorious.

          Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was "this

          shove.

          a.m. And no Sara. History is repeating itself.. .and Rebecca's
          pissed. She rips out her sketch page and throws it away.
          She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair
          back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial
          button. She starts to dial... but kills the call.
          She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly:
          A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk
          drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen:

          Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open. She's staring at
          Irene's Facebook Profile. There are some racy pictures of

          just move some of my stuff over,
          and spend a few nights a week

          something to think about. Plus we'd
          be able to keep Cuddles.
          As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares
          across the room at...
          Cuddles.

          Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she
          didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her.

          moving with a purpose.
          She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand

          with a sock on top of a nearby washer.
          Rebecca checks on her clothes. They're dry, with two minutes
          still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her
          duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles.

          Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door
          and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass.
          She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the
          dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and
          gets back up.
          Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time.
          Cuddles stumbles. Flips over.
          The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca,
          wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her
          last quarter. She gently places it in the slot.
          ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the
          glass at the kitten. She fingers the button.

          his office. It's small and intimate, with books stacked along
          every wall. Scraps of fabric are pinned to cork boards.
          Roberts smiles at her from his chair. He walks to the door
          and closes it. He walks back, pulls a chair close to hers,
          and sits down. She crosses her legs, her knees accidentally
          brushing against his.

</b>          I don't think I need to tell you

          shoots... the parties... that
          incredible runway. When the first
          model bursts through the curtain
          and hits that catwalk? Sara, a roar
          goes up from that crowd that's
          like... nothing you've ever heard.

          Sara's pulse is racing.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          I'm not sure I understand. Are you
          saying what I think you're saying?

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          I'm saying you have a shot. You'd
          have to earn it, Sara.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Of course. I'll do... anything.
          Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the
          quad... and now turns back to Sara.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          I'd like to see more danger in your
          work. Your designs are always
          crisp; they're always clear. But
          they're a little... safe.
          That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face.
          Roberts walks over to her.

</b>          Okay...
          He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks
          into her eyes.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          The best designers push the
          boundaries of what's... acceptable.
          They take chances. Do you like to
          take chances, Sara?

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Sometimes.

          He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her
          chair. She stands in front of him, shaking.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          I can't believe you just did that.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          I took a chance, that's all. With a
          student that I trust.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          I better go.
          Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door...

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't
          blow the chance of a lifetime.
          She hurries out of the office.

          Rebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops
          down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables.
          Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into
          space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans
          over, concerned.

<b>                         REBECCA

<b>                         SARA
</b>          My design professor just kissed me.
          Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next
          to Sara.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Are you alright?
          Sara nods.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Yeah, it just really creeped me

<b>          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
          Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He
          tosses some design sheets into his briefcase.
          He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips
          it onto his finger.
          He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable
          clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop
          at his door.
          Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He
          walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the
          bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him.
          He opens the door, revealing:
          Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black
          jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her
          shoulder.
          Roberts swallows his surprise.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Professor Roberts?

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          That's right.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          I'm glad I caught you.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          Actually, I was just...
          But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels
          snapping on the worn hardwood floor.

<b>          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

          Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her
          back inside. They face each other.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          You're not one of my students.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Not yet. That's why I'm here.

          is disarming. A beat.

</b>          I'm failing Intro Pysch.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          And why is that?

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Because I'm bored. I thought it
          would be all about Freud, and deep
          dark secrets. But it's brain
          chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay
          awake in class.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not
          sure what I can do to help.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Tomorrow's the last day to drop a
          course without penalty. Unless I
          can add another one in its place,
          I'll fall way behind in credits.
          Daddy won't take that very well. He

</b>          I'm pretty much at your mercy,

          Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's
           so calm, so steady. Roberts can't get a handle on her.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          Look, I've always made it a policy
          not to accept any students this
          late in the term.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Do I look like just any student to
          you?
          She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty
          feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus.
          She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She
          sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it
          up.

<b>                         REBECCA

           The game is on now. Roberts slowly walks around the desk,
          until he's behind Rebecca.
           In the picture frame's reflection, Rebecca sees him slip off
          his wedding ring. He palms it.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          A few things I'd need to know.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Ask me anything.
          He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          Do you have any design experience?

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          None.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          What do you know about clothes?

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Only one thing.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          And what's that?

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          I definitely look better out of
          them than in them.
          What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in
           close, between her parting legs. He looks into her eyes.
          Still steady.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          I think we might be able to work
          something out.

<b>                         REBECCA

</b>          He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second,
          and now gently pushes him away. He holds his ground. He's had
          a taste -- he wants a lot more.
          Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Ow! You're hurting me! Professor,
          stop!...
          Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her.
          What's going on? Rebecca smiles again.
          This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her
          eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her
          again...
          She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the
          floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which
          rolls away across the floor.
          Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can
          see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Birthday gift. You should get one,
          they're great.
          She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few
          seconds... and now hits the play button. We hear their prior
          conversation, played back.

<b>                         WALKMAN

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Oh, I'm not teasing.
          She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the
          floor.

          enough place for you?
          He recognizes his own words to Sara.

<b>                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS
</b>          What? How did?... Who are you?
          He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and
          slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells
          again.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          She trusted you.

          for that tape.
           Rebecca stops at the door. She kneels, picks up his wedding
           ring, and rolls it across the floor to him.

<b>                          REBECCA

          A WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures

          A somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror
          on the back of the front door. A very strange expression in
          her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now...
          Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly
          knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin
          is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot.
          And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to
          her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's
          getting more and more numb to the blows.
          She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and
          grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large,
          retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way
          out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places
          the knife against her skin and...

          drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage

<b>          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          Jeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen. He's
          lived here long enough to know his way in the dark.

<b>                         KITCHEN
</b>          Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates
          Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father.
          Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          Becs. You scared me.
          Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty
          look. We know how much she hates nicknames.

<b>          INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Sara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from
          downstairs. She climbs out of bed and walks to the door.

<b>          INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</b>
          Sara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and
          to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see...

<b>          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
          Rebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the
          moonlight through the window falling over them. Spooky.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          How're you doing?

<b>                         REBECCA

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          That's not what I meant.
          She looks down at the table.

          Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          Rebecca, look at me for a second.
          Now she looks at him.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          Your mother and I are very fond of
          you.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          I know.
          He doesn't know what else to say.
          Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall.
          Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the
          beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile
          happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.

<b>                         JEFF
</b>          I just wanted to make sure. Good
          night, I'm heading back to bed.
          He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.

<b>          INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY
</b>
          Sara waits by the front door. Alison walks in.

<b>                         ALISON
</b>          Hi Sara.

<b>                         SARA

          Alison peers up the stairs.

<b>                         ALISON
</b>          Rebecca seems to be doing well.

<b>                         SARA

</b>          Medication?
          Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs.
          Did she hear them? She walks down.

<b>                         ALISON
</b>          Hey sweetheart.
          She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>
<b>                         (TO SARA)
</b>          Ready?
          Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words.
          Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully.

<b>                         ALISON
</b>          Have a great time, you two.

<b>          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
</b>
          It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street.
          Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts
          discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Is everything okay?

          She wants to ask her about that medication.

<b>                         SARA

<b>          INT. COFFEE SHOP DAY
</b>
          Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE
          CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca.
          She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee.

</b>
<b>                         SARA
</b>          Thanks.
          The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out.
          What's she doing with Rebecca?
          The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep
          glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them
          a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>
<b>                         (TO SARA)
</b>          I used to come here like every day
          after school.
          The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting.
          One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks.
          Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's
          Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches.
          The chatting girls all fall silent.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          You know them?

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          They went to my high school.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Friends?
          Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye
          contact with the Brunette.
          The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves.
          Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance.
          As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible.
          The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances
          at Rebecca as they order their drinks.
          Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls.
          Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette.
          Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Let's leave.
          Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her
          things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table.
          The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights.

</b>

</b>          Hello.
          The other girls walk over. Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over,
          sending shivers down their spines. They want to back up their
          friend, but they look as scared as she does. Sara watches all
          this from a few feet away.
          Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Oh, I wanted to introduce you to
          Sara. My roommate.
          Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost
          as if she feels sorry for her.

<b>                         MARIA
</b>          Hi.
          Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An
          awkward beat. Everyone's tense. Sara clears her throat.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Well, we better go.
          Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as
          they open the door...

<b>                         MARIA
</b>          Rebecca.
          Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.

<b>                         MARIA
</b>          We were never friends.
          Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension
          building. Maria doesn't back down, though. She needed to say
          this. Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Come on, let's go.

<b>          INT. CAR - DAY: DRIVING
</b>
          Headed back to school. Sara looks out the window. Lost in
          thought.

</b>          I guess college is a fresh start
          for both of us.
          Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement
          on her face.
          Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara
          looks at the text message she just received from Irene:
          "back in LA. lemme know abt movin in."

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Irene's back in town.
          Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.

<b>          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY
</b>
          Sara's running through the quad.

<b>          EXT./INT. DORM - DAY
</b>
          Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in
          the front door as a student walks out. She bypasses the
          elevator, heading straight to the stairs.

<b>          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          She bursts out the door and into the hallway.

<b>          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY
</b>
          She walks in, still a bit out of breath. Rebecca is packing
          her back-pack.

<b>                         REBECCA

          She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her
          sketchpad behind on her bed. She eyes it for a beat. Looks at
          the closed door.
          As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Forgot my pad.
          She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's
          dresser. But first... She walks to the door and opens it.

<b>          INT. DORM HALLWAY
</b>
          Sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the
          empty hallway. She hears the elevator ding.

<b>          INT. DORM ROOM
</b>
          Sara heads straight for Rebecca's dresser. A beat. Is she
          really going to do this? Yes. She slides open the top drawer:
          Supplies. The second drawer: sketchpads. She leafs through
          them: Empty.
          She searches the third drawer: Sweaters. She feels around
          beneath them. Wait a minute. She pulls out:
          Two bottles of prescription medicine. "LITHIUM... For APD."
          Both bottles are full of pills. As Sara stares at them...

<b>          A HAND TAPS HER SHOULDER.
</b>          She leaps out of her socks. But it's just Stephen.

          Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her
          tight and speaks, muffled by her neck.

<b>          INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

          Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her
          drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a
          pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She
          looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train
          comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around.
          Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her
          drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks
          up and we see what she's been staring at:
          Irene.

<b>          INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

          three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic
          martinis and watching the dance floor.
          And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by
          herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around
          her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca.
          Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds
          her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices
          Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE

          opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in.
          Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene.
          She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms.
          Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her
          in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and
          smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find
          Rebecca's in the mirror.

          Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and
          pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips.

          An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to
          the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes
          the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to
          the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent
          the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm..

          glass again.
          Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She
          switches off the light in the kitchen. But as she starts to
          go back to her room ...WHAM!!
          Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene.

          Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper,
          grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her
          tattoo. Sara grabs a robe.
          A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the
          "big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.

          Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs.
          She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone,
          Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene.

          "outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )"
          Sara's relieved.

          Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out
          of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone.
          Her eyes search Sara's for an answer.
          Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches
          her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back.

          at her dorm room window... but she doesn't.
          Good thing, too. Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down.
          Her face is blank. Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank.

          Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the
          dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca
          watches him.

          He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel
          Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up.

          picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps
          out of it and walks out the door.

          Rebecca. Walking directly towards her from the other end of
          the quad.
          No one else is in sight. Sara thinks about veering off to the
          side. No. She can do this. She walks straight ahead. Rebecca
          keeps her pace; hooded sweater up, looking down at the
          pavement, listening to her Walkman.

          preparing herself for the confrontation. Ten feet away now.
          Five...

          Rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser. Opens the bottom
          drawer. Her sweaters. She fishes underneath them. Pulls out
          her lithium pills. But just looks at them. Anger in her eyes.
          She puts the bottle back.

          Jason walks through the hallway, checking the numbers on the

          the door. No answer. Knocks again.

          Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door,
          ignoring the knocks. Almost catatonic.
          Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest,
          shredding it to pieces.

          Jason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the

          thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the
          elevator.

          Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her
          fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water
          trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain.

          Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her
          reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long
          pair of shears. Her "Emily" tattoo is starting to heal. She
          gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears,
          still looking at it in the mirror.
          She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.
          Just above her shoulders.

          Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs
          through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls
          out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in
          front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing.
          Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain.
          Which she caresses in her hand.

          She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she
          sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an

          She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now

          Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed.
          The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for
          a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason
          barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep.
          Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares
          down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the
          floor. She's in just bra and panties now.
          She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake.

          He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she
          needs to. She settles onto him. And now starts to move.
          And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low
          light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap. Flat against
          the skin of her back.
          Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut.

          Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in
          shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the
          knife deep into his gut. He gasps.

          The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above...

</b>          Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I
          just want to be your friend.

          Sara and Irene are frantic.

<b>                         IRENE
</b>          My phone. My phone.
          She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table.
          She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut!

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Shit!

</b>          The window! There's a fire escape.
          You can reach it.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
          Rebecca looks around for the gun. Throwing chairs and
          furniture around. She finds it.
          Picks the gun off the floor.

<b>          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Sara races to the window and throws it open. There's just an
          empty street below. She eyes the fire escape. A nearly
          impossible leap away. But Sara's out of options.

<b>          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge. Her foot
          hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories... and smashes
          to pieces in the alley. Sara shuts her eyes.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Rebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires.

<b>          BLAM!
</b>
<b>          INT. BEDROOM
</b>
          The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead
          and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head. Feathers
          go flying. Irene screams.
          Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          I know you're scared, Sara. But I
          promise, everything is gonna be
          okay.
          She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge.
          Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in
          Irene's eyes.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend,
          not yours.
          She raises the gun at the helpless Irene...
          But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks
          her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet...

<b>          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Exploding through the window, shattering it and startling
          Sara, who loses her balance and slips off the ledge. She
          grabs on by her fingertips, her face hitting the brick wall.

          The more she screams, the more she loses her grip.

          Rebecca fires another shot, hitting a giant bedroom mirror,
          shattering it's reflection of Rebecca's struggle with
          Stephen.
          Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward.
          He keeps hold of her, and they hit the floor, the gun flying
          out of Rebecca's hand.
          Stephen gets on top. He lifts his arm high and balls his fist
          before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking
          her out cold.
          He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he
          races for the window.

          He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.

<b>          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - SAME
</b>
          Sara's crying, barely mouthing Stephen's name. He grabs her
          arms. Leaning halfway outside, he starts to pull her up.
          Part of the way up, he holds her against his chest and lets
          her cry. He smiles.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Okay I've got you. Everything is
          gonna be okay!
          He pulls her halfway in the window...
          But a shadow rises behind him.

<b>                         IRENE
</b>
<b>          STEPHEN!!!!
</b>          A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams.
          Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock.
          Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as...
          Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes... and
          lets go of her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          115.
</b>          She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen
          disappears from the window frame. Using the brick wall for
          leverage, she arduously lifts herself up into the window in
          time to see...
          Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window. He slumps
          to the floor, revealing:
          Rebecca. She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild.
          Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the
          window. She helps Sara in. They tumble onto the floor.
          Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Stephen.
          Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it
          out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes
          violently in her hand.
          Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on
          the floor.

<b>                         REBECCA

          Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock.
          Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in
          frustration. She drops the gun.
          Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara
          pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch...
          Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her
          knuckles white, and...
          CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall.
          She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where...
          Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of
          Rebecca's purse everywhere.
          Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt
          Sara.

<b>                         REBECCA
</b>          Friends help each other. They take
          care of each other.
          Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Rebecca. We were never friends.
          That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her
          eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from
          the floor, and slams her against the wall.
          She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns
          red. Redder...
          But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock.
          Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The
          utility knife is in her other hand... stuck between Rebecca's
          shoulder blades.
          Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She
          won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees...
          Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self-
          consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out
          and grabs Sara's hand.
          Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from
          around Rebecca's neck.
          Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything.

<b>                         SARA
</b>          Stephen. Hold on.
          She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen
          and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911.
          He looks into her eyes and smiles.
          She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes.

<b>          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          It's a warm, spring day. Sara, melancholy but looking in
          much better shape since the last time we saw her, stands in
          front of her dorm, looking to restart her college career.
          She plays with the silver chain once again around her neck.

          look at her. Know who she is. We see Kim and Tracy. They
          don't say anything. Don't know what to say.

<b>          INT. DORM ROOM

          Sara opens the door. The simple room is identical to her
          previous one. She hesitates at first but then walks in.
          There is a box marked "SARA" filled with the things she left
          behind in her old dorm. There's a knock on the open door.

<b>          STEPHEN (O.S.)

          Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her
          eyes before she goes back into her room.

<b>          INT. DORM ROOM

          Sara sits down on her bed. She watches the empty space where
          the other bed used to be. She just stares at it. The camera
          slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf
          where unseen by Sara, there's a flyer hung with a picture of
          Richard Prince's Nurse of Greenmeadow announcing an upcoming
          gallery exhibition.
