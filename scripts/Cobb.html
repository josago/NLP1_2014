</b>Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

    The room is California Spanish, thick walls, arches, and
    light spills in from a mission window. But we don't have
    any sense of place just yet. At first there are just
    details.

    keys. They wiggle.

</b>    lies on a couch near the window. He stands up suddenly
    and looks out the window. AL STUMP, 40, is sharply
    dressed -- tie, dress shirt, cufflinks. He's staring at
    something.

    The woman at the typewriter, a 50-year old steno/secre-

                 stranded here like a beached
                 whale -- only one phrase, one
                 word, from finishing the greatest

                 word, the right word -- Flaubert

                 It's your wife -- are you and she
                 speaking again?
    Stump's cavalier attitude stops cold.     He starts to reach
    for the phone, then stops.

    Stump is suddenly a nervous wreck.     He hesitates.

    the wall in his office.

    A classic city bar, a hangout for drunks, philosophers,
    and especially sportswriters and journalists.

    Our man hops off his pogo stick -- nobody even notices,
    and joins his cronies, five sportswriters full of dogmatic
    opinions on every subject known to man.

    FRANK, a sportswriter, is at the jukebox feeding quarters.
    He looks up routinely, they're all regulars here.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>              Hey, Stumpy...
    Stump addresses the sportswriters at the table as if they
    were a small audience in a lounge.

<b>                            STUMP
</b>              Awright, awright... how do you get

    Stump laughs. The others groan. REYNALDO, 40's, black,
    speaks up. He's one of the regulars.

              A drunk is taking a piss in front
              of a bar, a bus drives by, real
              fast right along the curb, and
              knocks his thing off. Drunk picks
              up his thing, puts it in his
              pocket, goes into a bar, reaches
              into his pocket and puts his thing
              on the bar. 'Look't that,' he
              says, 'bus knocked my thing off.'
              Bartender says, 'that ain't your
              thing -- that's a cigar butt.'

                 bartender and says, 'God damn it,
                 I mushta smoked my dick.'
    Everyone roars, even Stump. But Frank, as usual, is hyper
    serious and never quite gets into the revelry.

     road among snow-covered pines.

     A row of mailboxes catches Stump's attention, and he
     pulls over to review the names with a flashlight. He
     lights his way across the names of a dozen boxes --
     nothing, until:
     The last box, enormously oversized, bears the name "COBB."

     Stump parks and approaches somewhat warily.
     The sound of BREAKING GLASS and SHOUTING voices.

     Stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds
     refuge under the eave. The noise is frightening from
     that close. He stands unsurely -- does he knock?
     When --

     The door is thrown open -- a black man, WILLIE, 40, with
     a suitcase stands wildly upset, screaming back into the
     house.

</b>              Fuck you, Mr. Cobb, I have too much
              dignity to spend another moment
              with you. I hope you die before
              the sun comes up and may you rot
              in hell!
     The man whirls and is shocked to see Stump standing
     there with his own suitcase.
<b>                              WILLIE

              to take the job?

     Willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world
     of Cobb was finally too absurd. Cobb and a writer? In
     this weather? In any weather? And the man walks through
     the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain
     as Stump just stares.

     Stump turns and steps into the open doorway.

     Stump sits hunkered over a tiny portable typewriter on
     the kitchen table. Cobb mixes a bourbon with orange
     juice to wash down some more pills, which he takes
     randomly.

     A teletype MACHINE sits on a table nearby -- Throughout
     the scene, a tape CLICKS endlessly out, piling on the
     floor. Cobb occasionally checks data on the tape.

     Snow flurries greet Stump as he heads outside, and
     darkness is falling. He takes a deep breath.

</b>                  I couldn't be around the man for
                  long without needing a break, which
                  his painkillers gracefully
                  provided.

                  My sanity would soon depend upon
                  a frequent breath of fresh air, a
                  walk in the woods -- any escape
                  from what one sportswriter had
                  called 'Cobb's brooding soul that
                  bubbled with violence.'
     Stump lights a pipe as he walks up a trail, away from the
     lodge, toward a ridge, all covered with snow. The
     flurries of snow are getting thicker now.
<b>                                STUMP (V.O.)
</b>                  I knew most of the Cobb stories --
                  first man elected to the Hall of
                  Fame, ahead of the incomparable
                  Babe Ruth. Statistics that haven't
                  been approached in three-quarters
                  of a century.
     Stump stops at the ridge and looks down at the partially
     frozen Lake Tahoe in the lingering light.

     Stump continues walking down a crest of snow, through
     a stand of snow-covered pines. The light is dark,
     purple, eerie, and Stump is lost in thought, until,
     suddenly, he sees:

     A trail of blood in the snow. He follows it down a
     slope, past a tree, growing deeper, thicker. And there
     it is --

     The buck lies dead in the snow in a pool of blood.
     Stump stops in fear, then approaches, leans down
     and examines --

     The buck's head has a hole blasted behind the ear.

     Stump rises quickly to his feet and looks around.
     The woods are silent. Snow falls from a branch. And...
     He hurries back through the woods up the ridge, momen-
     tarily lost as the snow swirls, he finally spots the
     lodge.

     placing bets, intermingling with the players. A player

     ering a pitch which is swung on and missed, strike three.

     Cobb heads to the plate, passing his dejected teammate
     who has just struck out.

     drops something on home plate, in front of the CATCHER.

     The pitcher delivers a fastball right at Cobb's head --
     He hits the dirt just before the pitch arrives (and this
     is long before players wore protective headgear).

     Cobb rises, laughing defiantly.

     athlete, the great HONUS WAGNER.

     holds the bat strangely, with a split grip, a left-
     handed batter, he dangles the bat almost parallel to the
     ground. For all his fierceness, there's a delicacy in
     the way he holds the bat. A baton, a paintbrush, a magic
     wand...

     Here comes the pitch -- sinker away -- and Cobb unleashes
     a swing that is at once quick and powerful. He drives the
     ball to left, the opposite way --

     Wagner lunges to his right -- But the ball skips into
     left.

     Cobb streaks to first and rounds the base viciously, daring
     to stretch it into a double but slamming on the brakes and
     returning to first when the throw rifles into second.
     Cobb shouts defiantly at the pitcher.

</b>     The pitcher stretches, looks and delivers -- and Cobb
     breaks for second. The pitch is wide. The Catcher fires.

     Wagner takes the throw as Cobb arrives in a spikes-up
     slide.
     And Wagner swipes a brutal tag in Cobb's face -- his giant
     ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes
     across Cobb's mouth. Blood gushes. The ball pops free.
     Wagner seems unbothered by the fact that Cobb is safe at
     second -- he has bloodied Cobb's face. Cobb seems unboth-
     ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess -- he has
     stolen second. Both men seem satisfied.

     nods, winds up, and as he does --
     Here comes Cobb with a recklessness beyond reason. And
     as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher
     digs in to take on Cobb --
     Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back
     leg slashing his spikes like knives. It is a slide of
     utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm.
     A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood
     and dust. The ball rolls free. Safe.

     Cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in
     seconds, a brawl breaks out, both benches clearing. As
     the police rush out to break up the brawl...

     Cobb stares at Stump, waiting for an answer, and forgets
     about the road.

     his head. Stump feeds Willie, watching Cobb's       racism
     simmer.

     A WOMAN, 30s, stands at the counter in the middle of some

     The woman turns to confront the two men.     Now we see her.
     On a fabulous platinum-blonde wig is stuck    a yellow
     slicker-type rain hat. The ear flaps are     awry, the
     platinum-blonde wig curls up around it --    the effect is

     Cobb breaks into a little dance with Ramona at the table,
     much to Stump's (and Ramona's) amazement. For a moment,
     at least, there is great footwork and lightness in his
     movement -- we get a glimpse of the great athlete he once
     was.

     And Cobb heads for the stage, walking better but not
     without effort, a walk enhanced by drugs and booze. As
     he does, Ramona turns to Stump.

                         (back to Ramona)
                  This assignment has me befuddled.
                  I'm supposed to tell the world
                  that a monster is really a
                  prince. I'm supposed to lie.

</b>                  Then it's not a lie. It's a job.
                  Quit agonizing -- take the money,
                  do what you gotta do, and get it
                  over with.

                  learn about greatness.

     down.

     Stump lies on the floor only half conscious. He grabs
     his head. Blood. The room swirls in front of him as --

     Cobb grabs Ramona, pulling his everpresent gun from his

                   everything else, he viewed it as a
                   competition that he was not going

      fireplace. Stump is in a bathrobe, his feet in a big
      pan of warm water, a bottle of booze in his hand. He
      looks a mess. Cobb is idly playing with his pistol.
      He's calm, introspective.

      begins pumping.

      at the magnificent old structure, the overhanging right
      field facade, the great upper deck, almost a century of

                  I needed Cobb to be somebody he was
                  not. I needed him to be a hero.
