       SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears. 
       Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre 
       two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and 
       audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, 
       home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. 
       Across the river was the competition, built by Philip 
       Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...

       ...The Rose...

       Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three-
       tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, 
       roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It 
       says:

<b>       SEPT. 7TH & 8TH AT NOON
</b>
<b>       MR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE

</b>
       OVER THIS the screams of a man under torture. The screams 
       are coming from the curtained stage.

<b>                           VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                 You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it 
                 is I who am bitten?

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
</b>
       The theatre owner, PHILLIP HENSLOWE, is the man 
       screaming. HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned 
       in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of 
       a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that 
       position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN, 
       who is the owner of the VOICE. The fourth man, FREES, is 
       FENNYMAN'S bookkeeper.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 What am I, Mr. Lambert?

<b>                           LAMBERT
</b>                 Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

<b>                           FREES
</b>                 Twelve pounds, one shilling and four 
                 pence, Mr. Fennyman, including 
                 interest.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Aaagh! I can pay you!

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 When?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! 
                 For pity's sake.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Take his feet out. Where will you get

<b>                           FREES
</b>                     (the mathematical genius with 
                      a notebook)
                 Sixteen pounds, five shillings and 
                 nine pence

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 including interest in three weeks?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 I have a wonderful new play!

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Put his feet in.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 It's a comedy.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Cut his nose off.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 And his ears.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 And a share. We will be partners, Mr. 
                 Fennyman!

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                     (hesitating)
                 Partners!

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken 
                 identities, a shipwreck, a pirate 
                 king, a bit with a dog, and love 
                 triumphant.

<b>                           LAMBERT
</b>                 I think I've seen it. I didn't like 
                 it.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 This time it is by Shakespeare.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 What's the title?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Good title.

       FENNYMAN snaps his fingers at FREES and LAMBERT. LAMBERT 
       unties HENSLOWE, FREES starts writing a contract.

<b>                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
</b>                 A play takes time. Find actors… 
                 rehearsals…let's say open in three 
                 weeks. That's--what--five hundred 
                 groundlings at tuppence each, in 
                 addition four hundred groundlings 
                 tuppence each, in addition four 
                 hundred backsides at three pence--a 
                 penny extra for a cushion, call it two 
                 hundred cushions, say two performance 
                 for safety how much is that Mr. Frees?

<b>                           FREES
</b>                 Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. 
                 Fennyman.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Correct!

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 But I have to pay the actors and the 
                 authors.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 A share of the profits.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 There's never any

<b>                           FENNYMAN

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (impressed)
                 Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit 
                 on something.

       FENNYMAN slaps a contract down on the table next to n ink-
       pot and quill.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Sign here.

       HENSLOWE takes the quill and signs.

</b>                 Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Without doubt he is completing it at 
                 this very moment.

<b>       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY
</b>
       A small cramped space in the eaves of a building. A 
       cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged 
       between crumpled pieces of paper. Among those we have 
       time to observe: a skull, a mug that says A PRESENT FROM 
<b>       STRATFORD-UPON-AVON. 
</b>
       At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper 
       are tossed towards the shelf. The man who is throwing 
       them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing 
       studiously with a quill. 

       Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his 
       signature, over and over again. "Will Shagsbeard…W 
       Shakspur…William Shasper…" Each time he is dissatisfied, 
       and each time he crumples, and tosses it away. 

       Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to 
       the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts 
       to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and 
       HENSLOWE walks in. He is out of breath and his feet hurt.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Will! Where is my play? Tell me you 
                 have it nearly done! Tell me you have 
                 it started.
                     (desperately)
                 You have begun?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (struggling with his boots)
                 Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt 
                 that the sun doth move

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 No, no, we haven't the time. Talk 
                 prose. Where is my play?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (tapping his forehead and 
                      heading out the door)
                 It is all locked safe in here

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 God be praised!
                     (then doubt)
                 Locked?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 As soon as I have found my muse

<b>       EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       WILL lives in a crowded area of the city. Hawkers are 
       crying their wares, tract-sellers, delivery boys, and 
       merchants go about their business. HENSLOWE catches up 
       with WILL as he strides purposefully along.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (catching up)
                 Who is she this time?!

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 She is always Aphrodite.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind 
                 the Dog and Trumpet?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Henslowe, you have no soul so how can 
                 you understand the emptiness that 
                 seeks a soulmate?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Well, I am a dead man and buggered to 
                 boot. My theatre is close by the 
                 plague these twelve weeks, my company 
                 is playing the inn-yards
                 of England, while Burbage and the 
                 Chamberlain's Men are invited to court 
                 and receive ten pounds to play your 
                 piece, written for my theatre, by my 
                 writer, at my risk when you were green 
                 and grateful -

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 What piece? Richard Crookback?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 No--it's comedy they want, Will! 
                 Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Who wrote that?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Nobody! You are writing it for me! I 
                 gave you three pounds a month since.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Half what you owed me. I am still due 
                 for One Gentleman of Verona.

<b>       EXT. ANOTHER STREET. DAY
</b>
       HENSLOWE'S hardly paused in his appeal.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 . . . Will! What is money to you and 
                 me? I, your patron, you my wordwright! 
                 When the plague lifts Burbage will 
                 have a new Christopher Marlowe for the 
                 Curtain and I have nothing for the 
                 Rose.

       WILL stops.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty 
                 pounds?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (staggered)
                 Fifty pounds? What for?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Burbage offers me a partnership in the 
                 Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my 
                 hired player days are over.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to 
                 the dogs!

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (answering for him)
                 No, then.

       WILL turns down a side street.

<b>       EXT. MARKETPLACE. DAY.
</b>
       HENSLOWE and WILL are crossing a crowded marketplace 
       where a Puritan preacher, MAKEPEACE, is haranguing anyone 
       who will listen.

<b>                           MAKEPEACE
</b>                 and the Lord shall smite them! Yea, 
                 harken to me. The theatres are 
                 handmaidens of the devil! Under the 
                 name of the Curtain, the players
                 breed lewdness in your wives, 
                 rebellion in your servants, idleness 
                 in your apprentices and wickedness in 
                 your children! And the Rose smells 
                 thusly rank by any name! I say a 
                 plague on both their houses!

       As he passes WILL gratefully makes a mental note.

<b>       EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       WILL turns into a narrow street and walks toward a 
       doorway.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Where are you going?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 To my weekly confession.

       As HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign 
       identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH, 
       apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of 
       dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled.

       A stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling, pills, 
       potions, amulets and charms, star charts and mystic 
       paraphernalia festoon the place. Testimonials and framed 
       degrees hang on the walls. 

       WILL lying on a couch, on his back. His eyes are closed 

       DR. MOTH sits by the couch, listening to WILL and 
       occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee. 
       What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of 
       analysis. The session is being timed by an hourglass.

                 hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a

       WILL seems unwiling to respond. DR. MOTH refers to his 
       notes.

       DR. MOTH reaches for a glass snake bracelet.

                 I will see you in a week.

       He holds out his hand. WILL drops a sovereign into it, 
       and takes the bracelet.

<b>       EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       WILL comes out. HENSLOWE is waiting, standing in a horse 
       trough to ease his feet. WILL walks straight past him, 
       and HENSLOWE follows.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Now where? Will?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 To the Palace at Whitehall.

<b>       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
</b>
       WHITEHALL means nothing yet. We are behind closed 
       curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the 
       imminent performance of Two Gentlemen of Verona. This is 
       not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see. 

       RICHARD BURBAGE is to play "PROTEUS." A BOY PLAYER will 
       play "SILVIA," and last minute improvements to his makeup 
       etc. are being applied by BURBAGE'S mistress ROSALINE. 
       "LAUNCE," one of the clowns, is the famous comedian WILL 
       KEMPE. "LAUNCE'S" dog, CRAB is in KEMPE'S charge and is 
       not helping much. There is no set. A helpful placard 
       reading VERONA--AN OPEN PLACE, is ready to hand. MUSICIANS 
       can be heard tuning their instruments. From the other 
       side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. KEMPE 
       leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of 
       proops. He finds a skull. He has one foot on the box, his 
       elbow on his knee, he looks at the skull…in other words 
       he reminds us of Hamlet. We see this from the POV of 
       WILL, who is just entering through a door backstage.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (approaching)
                 Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You 
                 too, good Crab.

<b>                           KEMPE
</b>                 Crab is nervous. He has never played 
                 the Palace. When will you write me a 
                 tragedy, Will? I could do it.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 No, they would laugh at Seneca if you 
                 played it.

       WILL'S attention has been caught by ROSALINE, BURBAGE'S 
       mistress. ROSALINE is big breasted, dark-eyed, dark-
       haired, sexual.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                     (to ROSALINE)
                 My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress 
                 Rosaline, where were my seamstress's 
                 eyes?

       BURBAGE kisses her mouth and slaps her behind. He comes 
       over to greet WILL.

<b>                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
</b>                 There is no dog in the first scene, 
                 Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it 
                 Will?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I am still owed money for this play, 
                 Burbage.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 Not from me. I only stole it. When are 
                 you coming over to the Chamberlain's 
                 Men?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 When I have fifty pounds.

       ROSALINE brings over the last elements of BURBAGE'S 
       costume and helps him into them.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 Are you writing?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (nods somewhat defensively)
                 A comedy. All but done, a pirate 
                 comedy, wonderful.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 What is the chief part?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 The title?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Romeo

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 It's for Henslowe. He paid me.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 How much?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Ten pounds.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 You're a liar.

       BURBAGE digs under his costume for his purse, which is on 
       a waistband, over his corset.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and 
                 the Admiral's Men.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 Ned is wrong for it.

       WILL turns to see HENSLOWE approaching.

<b>                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
</b>                     (to WILL)
                 Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you 
                 two more when you show me the pages.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Done.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (arriving)
                 Burbage, I will see you hanged for a 
                 pickpocket.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 The Queen has commanded, she loves a 
                 comedy and the Master of the Revels 
                 favours us.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 And what favour does Mr. Tilney 
                 receive from you?

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 Ask him.

       The Master of the Revels (TILNEY) comes through the 
       curtain officiously.

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 She comes!

       He disappears back through the curtains. The hubbub falls 
       silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy PLAYERS 
       know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and 
       find places to peep through.

<b>       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF 
</b><b>       HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.
</b>
<b>       THE POV OF THE PLAYERS.
</b>
       The arrival of QUEEN ELIZABETH, aged sixty, coming to 
       take her place in the audience at front centre. The hill 
       is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her 
       seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the 
       QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience 
       an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound. 

       Close on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing "W. 
       Shakespeare." WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips 
       it into the mouth of the snake bangle. 

       The curtain draws back and CONDELL as "VALENTINE" and 
       BURBAGE as "PROTEUS" begin the play.

<b>                           CONDELL AS VALENTINE
</b>                 "Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus; 
                 Home-keeping youth have ever homely 
                 wits…"

<b>       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. THE 
</b><b>       WINGS/BACKSTAGE. DAY.
</b>
       With BURBAGES'S presence accounted for on stage, ROSALINE 
       curls an arm around WILL'S neck. They kiss hungrily. 
       After a moment, WILL pulls back.

<b>                           ROSALINE
</b>                 When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I have lost my gift.

<b>                           ROSALINE
</b>                 You left it in my bed. Come to look 
                 for it again.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?

<b>                           ROSALINE
</b>                 Burbage has my keeping but you have my 
                 heart.

       WILL takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm. 
       ROSALINE looks at it, then at WILL. Then they kiss again, 
       but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the 
       auditorium.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 You see? The consumptives plot against 
                 me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let 
                 us go and cough through it."

<b>       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. STAGE. DAY.
</b>
       "VALENTINE" is on stage with "PROTEUS."

<b>       CONDELL AS VALENTINE
</b>
       "To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans: Coy 
       looks with heart sore sighs; One fading moment's mirth 
       With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights…"

       As the scene continues, WILL appears at the back of the 
       hall and finds himself next to HENSLOWE.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I feel a scene coming on.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Is it about a pirate's daughter?

<b>       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACK OF THE BANQUETING HALL/STAGE. 
</b><b>       DAY.
</b>
       Laughter. It is later, and KEMPE is now on stage with his 
       dog. The audience is roaring.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 You see? Comedy.

       QUEEN ELIZABETH'S idiosyncratic laugh rises above the 
       others.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 Well played, Master Crab, I commend 
                 you.

       She throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it 
       down. Everyone applauds.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Love and a bit with a dog, that's what 
                 they like.

       Now we meet VIOLA. VIOLA DE LESSEPS is twenty-five and 
       beautiful, and she is laughing with great natural 
       enjoyment. She sits slightly apart from her small family 
       group--her parents, SIR ROBERT DE LESSEPS and LADY 
       MARGARET DE LESSEPS. Part of the group but seated behind 
       as befits her lower status is VIOLA'S NURSE. 

       Elsewhere is LORD WESSEX, our villain. WESSEX is in his 
       forties, dark cruel, self-important. He has noticed 
       VIOLA. The nurse notices him.

<b>       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF 
</b><b>       HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.
</b>
       LATER. "VALENTINE" is on stage alone. He is speaking the 
       speech rather more coarsely than the version we hear 
       later.

<b>                           CONDELL AS VALENTINE
</b>                 "What light is light if Silvia be not 
                 seen? 
                 What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? 
                 Unless it be to think that she is by 
                 And feed upon the shadow of 
                 perfection…"

       Now we see that VIOLA knows the speech by heart, and is 
       silently mouthing it with the actor.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 There's a lady knows your play by 
                 heart.

       But when he turns to WILL he finds that WILL has gone.

<b>       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.
</b>
       WILL comes into his room, goes straight to his table in 
       the window, and arranges pen, ink, and paper. Now he has 
       his ritual: he spins round once in a circle, rubs his 
       hands together and spits on the floor. Then he sits down, 
       picks up his pen, and stares in front of him. PAUSE. Then 
       he begins to write.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
       The NURSE is undressing her, though VIOLA tries 
       intermittently to push her away. She is still bright with 
       excitement.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Did you like Proteus or Valentine 
                 best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine 
                 for looks.

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 I liked the dog, for laughs.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 But Silvia I did not care for much. 
                 His fingers were red from fighting and 
                 he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. 
                 Stage love will never be true love 
                 while the law of the land has our 
                 heroines played by pipsqueak boys in 
                 petticoats! Oh, when can we see 
                 another?

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 When the Queen commands it.

<b>                           VIOLA

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 Be still.

       Now the NURSE is cleaning VIOLA'S ears, one by one, of 
       course. She has an ear-cleaning implement for this. VIOLA 
       submits.

<b>                           NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>                 Playhouses are not for well-born

<b>                           VIOLA

<b>       EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.
</b>
       HENSLOWE is making his way from the theatre to the market 
       place when FENNYMAN and LAMBERT appear at either shoulder 
       and propel him back the way he came. FREES follows 
       behind.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 This time we take your boots off!

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 The theatres are all closed by the 
                 plague!

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Oh, that.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 by order of the Master of the Revels!

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the 
                 theatre business.
                     (they stop)
                 The natural condition is one of 
                 insurmountable obstacles on the road 
                 to imminent disaster. Believe me, to 
                 be close by the plague is a bagatelle 
                 in the ups and downs of owning a 
                 theatre.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 So what do we do?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Nothing. Strangely enough , it all 
                 turns out well.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 How?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 I don't know. It's a mystery.

<b>                           LAMBERT
</b>                     (dumbly)
                 Should I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

       At this point din is heard in the background. a 
       messenger, ringing a bell, is running though the street.

<b>                           MESSENGER
</b>                 The theatres are reopened. By order of 
                 the Master of the Revels, the theatres 
                 are reopened

       FENNYMAN is intrigued.

<b>                           FREES
</b>                 Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened 
                 the playhouses.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Yes I heard.

       HENSLOWE plays his temporary advantage modestly, 
       shrugging himself free of LAMBERT'S grip.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (to LAMBERT)
                 If you wouldn't mind

       HENSLOWE continues on his way. FENNYMAN watches HENSLOWE, 
       curious.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Where is the play?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Oh, it's coming, it's coming.

<b>       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.
</b>
       It is. WILL is writing furiously. A burnt-down candle is 
       still alight, although it is day outside the window. He 
       has been writing all night. He has written about ten 
       pages. Pleased with himself and excited, he gathers them 
       up and leaves the room like a man with a mission.

<b>       EXT. WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       Leaving the house, pages in hand, WILL nearly knocks down 
       HENSLOWE who has come to see him.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Will! The theatres are

       Before he can finish, WILL brandishes the pages in his 
       hand.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God,

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Rosaline? You mean Ethel.

       WILL has gone.

<b>       EXT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       BURBAGE lives in another part of the city. WILL bangs 
       through the door without ceremony.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (shouting)
                 Richard!

<b>       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL enters and calls out.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Burbage?

<b>       INT. BURBAGE'S BEDROOM. DAY.
</b>
       WILL charges into the bedroom. ROSALINE is in bed. The 
       Master of the Revels is pulling up his breeches. WILL is 
       shattered.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Mr. Tilney

       The unsuccessful snake bracelet glints at him from 
       ROSALINE'S arm.

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 Like you, I found him not at home!

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 So this is the favour you find in the

                     (turning to go)
                 Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by 
                 Will Shakespeare.

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 What does Burbage care of that? He is 
                 readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 You have opened the playhouses?

</b>                     (sighs)
                 Yes, I know. But he was always hanging 
                 around the house.

       A bell can be heard ringing outside.

<b>                           ROSALINE
</b>                     (to WILL, leaving)
                 Will…you're the only one, Will!--in my 
                 heart.

<b>       EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       WILL emerges looking distraught. A burning brazier stands 
       by the wall. WILL thrusts the pages into the coals. He 
       watches for a moment as the pages catch fire.

<b>       INT. TAVERN. DAY.
</b>
       WILL walks in to find the place in an uproar of 
       celebration. A handsome young serving man (NOL) is 
       bumping through with a tray of tankards.

<b>                           NOL
</b>                     (excitedly)

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Yes, I heard. The theatres are open. 
                 But where is my playwright?

       HENSLOWE finds a seat, and takes a tankard off NOL'S 
       tray.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Chalk it up, Nol. I'm hungry, too.

       They are interrupted by WILL who joins them. He looks 
       distracted.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Will! Have you finished?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Yes. Nearly.
                     (he taps his forehead)
                 It's all locked safe in here. We need 
                 Ralph for the Pirate King. Good 
                 morning, Master Nol. You will have a 
                 nice little part.

       NOL shouts for you, takes off his apron and flings it 
       behind the bar. HENSLOWE jumps up and embraces WILL. The 
       entire staff and half the customers are now crowding 
       around, actors the lot of them. HENSLOWE bangs the table 
       to shut them all up.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men are 
                 out on tour. I need actors. Those here 
                 who are unknown will have a chance to 
                 be known.

<b>                           ACTOR

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 It won't cost you a penny! Auditions 
                 in half-an-hour!

       The din of excited chatter returns. He sweeps grandly to 
       the tavern door…where he meets RALPH BASHFORD, a big, 
       burly, middle-aged actor.

<b>                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
</b>                 Ralph Bashford! I'd have a part for 
                 you but, alas, I hear you are a

       WILL has remained behind, aghast now at his predicament. 
       He goes to the bar.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Give me to drink mandragora.

<b>                           MARLOWE
</b>                     (trying to work it out)
                 A different one you haven't written?

       WILL makes a helpless gesture and hurries after NOL.

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. GALLERY/STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
</b>
       HENSLOWE and WILL are sitting in the gallery, listening 
       to a YOUNG ACTOR auditioning.

<b>                           YOUNG ACTOR
</b>                 " …Was this the face that launched a 
                 thousand ships, And burnt the topless 
                 towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me 
                 immortal with a kiss!"

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Thank you.

       HENSLOWE and WILL look a bit deflated. The YOUNG ACTOR 
       leaves and is replaced by a SECOND ACTOR.

<b>                           SECOND ACTOR
</b>                 I would like to give you something 
                 from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 How refreshing.

<b>                           SECOND ACTOR
</b>                 "Was this the face that launched a 
                 thousand ships, And burnt the topless 
                 towers of Ilium?"

       HENSLOWE and WILL let him continue a bit further, but 
       exchange despairing looks. A succession of would-be 
       actors offer their version of Marlowe's lines, each as 
       inappropriate as the other. Among them is a small URCHIN.

<b>                           URCHIN
</b>                 "…the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet 
                 Helen, make me immortal with a--?"

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (bellows)
                 Thank you!

       The URCHIN leaves, glowering furiously, and is replaced 
       by a beanpole of a man (WASBASH). WABASH has a bad 
       stutter.

<b>                           WABASH
</b>                 "W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f-f-
                 f-face…"

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (unexpectedly)
                 Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent. 
                 Report to the property master.

       WILL looks at HENSLOWE in outrage.

<b>                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
</b>                     (apologetically)
                 My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I 
                 have a few debts here and there. Well, 
                 that seems to be everybody. Did you 
                 see a Romeo?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I did not.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Well, I to my work, you to yours. When 
                 can I see pages?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Tomorrow

       HENSLOWE leaves him.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                     (a prayer)
                 please God.

       WILL sits brooding alone for a moment. Then he realizes 
       he is being addressed from the stage. ANOTHER ACTOR.

<b>                           ACTOR
</b>                 May I begin, sir?

       WILL looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man, 
       with a hat shadowing his eyes.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Your name?

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 Thomas Kent. I would like to do a 
                 speech by a writer who commands the 
                 heart of every player.

       WILL can hardly manage a nod.

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
</b>                 "What light is light, if Silvia be not 
                 seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be

                 is by And feed upon the shadow of 
                 perfection.

       It does not take four lines of "VALENTINE'S" speech to 
       confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is 
       VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon 
       gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has 
       found his "ROMEO".

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
</b>                 " …except I be by Silvia in the night,

                 Unless I look on Silvia in the day, 
                 There is no day for me to look upon."

       WILL interrupts "him."

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Take off your hat.

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Where did you learn how to do that?

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b><b>                 I . . .
</b>
<b>                           WILL

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Let me see you. Take off your hat.

       THOMAS begins to panic. WILL jumps down to ground level. 
       THOMAS runs offstage, to WILL'S bewilderment. WILL 
       hurries after him. We go with WILL as he crosses the 
       stage, then backstage, then into the

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. RETIRING ROOM. DAY.
</b>
       RETIRING ROOM which is crowded with actors and HENSLOWE'S 
       lieutenant, property manager, copier, and general 
       factotum who is a new character, PETER.

<b>                           ACTOR
</b>                 What are we playing?

<b>                           NOL
</b>                 Where are the pages?

       WILL enters into the middle of this.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (shouts)
                 Where's the boy?

       NOBODY knows what he is talking about. WABASH, the 
       stutterer, grabs Will's hand and shakes it excitedly.

<b>                           WABASH
</b>                 B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg!

       The street door is swinging shut. WILL sees it. He fights 
       his way through the men to get to the door.

<b>       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BANKSIDE. DAY.
</b>
       WILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing 
       with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins, 
       tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews 
       (lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time 
       before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded 
       street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank.

<b>       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.
</b>
       When WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in 
       a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The 
       river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a 
       number of waiting "taxis." WILL jumps into the nearest 
       one and shouts at the "Taxi Driver" BOATMAN.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Follow that boat!

<b>                           BOATMAN
</b>                 Right you are, governor!

       WILL sits in the stern of the boat and the BOATMAN sits 
       facing him, rowing lustily.

<b>                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)
</b>                 I know your face. Are you an actor?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (oh God, here we go again)
                 Yes.

<b>                           BOATMAN
</b>                 Yes, I've seen you in something. That 
                 one about a king.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Really?

<b>                           BOATMAN
</b>                 I had the Christopher Marlowe in my 
                 boat once.

<b>       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.
</b>
       LATER. The BOATMAN is puffing. WILL is looking ahead to 
       where THOMAS'S boat has reached a jetty on the farther 
       shore, a private jetty attached to a rich house on the 
       north bank. WILL sees THOMAS jump out of his boat and run 
       toward the house.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Do you know that house?

<b>                           BOATMAN
</b>                 Sir Robert De Lesseps.

<b>       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       WILL runs towards the house.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES'S HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       THOMAS rushes up the back stairs, removing his hat. Her 
       hair tumbles down about her shoulders, so we will call 
       her VIOLA again.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.
</b>
       Her mother LADY DE LESSEPS, is talking to the NURSE.

<b>       LADY DE LESSEPS
</b>
       Where is she? Our guests are upon us, Lord Wessex too, 
       bargaining for a bride. My husband will have it settled 
       tonight.

       Behind her, the door opens revealing VIOLA as THOMAS to 
       the NURSES view, but only for a moment. The door closes 
       again as LADY DE LESSEPS turns.

<b>                           LADY DE LESSEPS (CONT'D)
</b>                 Tomorrow he drags me off to the 
                 country and it will be three weeks 
                 gone before we return from our 
                 estates.

       A different door communicating to the next room, opens 
       and VIOLA comes in after a lightning dress change into a 
       robe. She curtseys to her mother.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 God save you, mother.
                     (to NURSE)
                 Ho water, nurse.

       The NURSE looks at her, round-eyed.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY.
</b>
       From a cauldron on the stove, hot water is poured into 
       two pails, by the a KITCHEN BOY under the NURSE'S 
       command.

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 Who asks for him?

       WILL has come to the kitchen door with a letter.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and 
                 playwright of the Rose.

       The NURSE sends the SCULLERY MAID back to work.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BATHROOM. EVENING.
</b>
       VIOLA in her bath, reads WILL'S letter. The NURSE is 
       adding hot water to the tub.

                 stolen from the cradle and fostered to 
                 manhood by his Montague mother that

                 Pirate King!

<b>       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL waits hopefully. The kitchen door opens and a 
       SERVANT flings a bucket of dirty water in the general 
       direction of the gutter. WILL hops nimbly aside and 
       escapes a soaking.

<b>                           SERVANT

                 You will not tell. As you love me and 
                 as I love you, you will bind my breast 
                 and buy me a boy's wig!

<b>       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying 
       instruments. WILL recognizes them.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Master Plum! What business here?

<b>                           MUSICIAN
</b>                 A five shilling business, Will. We 
                 play for the dancing.

       The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a 
       GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who 
       have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the 
       house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX 
       skid to a halt and enter the house.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL has got in with the MUSICIANS. Competently enough he 
       strums along with them on the bandstand. Two dozen guests 
       are enough to crowd the space for dancing. WILL glances 
       around, looking for THOMAS KENT. He stops a passing 
       SERVANT, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.

<b>                           SERVANT
</b>                 Musicians don't eat, Sir Robert's

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I seek Master Thomas Kent.

       It means nothing to the SERVANT who moves on. ANGLE ON 
       WESSEX and SIR ROBERT.

<b>                           SIR ROBERT
</b>                 She is a beauty, my lord, as would 
                 take a king to church for a dowry of a 
                 nutmeg.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 My plantations in Virginia are not 
                 mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an 
                 ancient name that will bring you 
                 preferment when your grandson is a 
                 Wessex. Is she fertile?

<b>                           SIR ROBERT
</b>                 She will breed. If she do not, send 
                 her back.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Is she obedient?

<b>                           SIR ROBERT
</b>                 As any mule in Christendom. But if you 
                 are the man to rider her, their are 
                 rubies in the saddlebag.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 I like her.

       ANGLE on WILL--watching the dancing. Then he sees VIOLA in 
       the crowd. He turns to blood. 
       Love at first sight, no doubt about it. VIOLA has not 
       seen him. She is doing a daughter's duty among her 
       parents' friends. The guests form up to begin a changing-
       partners dance (the very same one you get in every ROMEO 
       and JULIET).

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (to Musician)
                 By all the stars in heaven, who is 
                 she?

<b>                           MUSICIAN
</b>                 Viola de Lesseps. Dream on, Will.

       WILL leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to 
       keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers. VIOLA 
       moves through patterns of the dance until…as night 
       follows day, she finds WILL opposite her. He has 
       insinuated himself into the dance. VIOLA gasps.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Master Shakespeare

       WILL reacts, surprised by her reaction. The dance 
       separates them. VIOLA finds herself opposite WESSEX.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 My lady Viola.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 My lord.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 I have spoken with your father.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 So my lord? I speak with him every 
                 day.

       WESSEX scowls. The dance separates them. VIOLA finds 
       herself opposite WILL again. WILL stares at her 
       entranced.

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 Good sir… ?

       WILL has lost his tongue.

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 I heard you are a poet.

       WILL nods in his trance and she smiles at him.

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 But a poet of no words?

       WILL tries to speak but the silver tongue won't work. He 
       is dumb with adoration. Suddenly WESSEX takes him affably 
       by the elbow and leads him into an alcove.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (smiling evilly)
                 "Poet?"

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (coming round form the 
                      anaesthetic and not noticing 
                      the danger)
                 I was a poet till now, but I have seen 
                 beauty that puts my poems at one with 
                 the talking ravens at the Tower.

       To his surprise he finds a lordly dagger at this throat.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                     (startled)
                 How do I offend, my lord?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 By coveting my property. I cannot shed 
                 blood in her house but I will cut your 
                 throat anon. You have a name?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (gulps)
                 Christopher Marlowe at your service.

       WESSEX shoves him through the nearest door.

       VIOLA'S eyes are searching the room for WILL. She finds 
       WESSEX smiling at her. She looks away.

<b>       EXT. DE LESSEPS' GARDEN/VIOLA'S BALCONY. NIGHT
</b>
       There is a lighted window on the balcony. VIOLA, dressed 
       for bed, and the NURSE pass across the lighted space. 
       WILL is in the garden. He sees her. The light in the room 
       is extinguished. WILL sighs. Then VIOLA comes out onto 
       the balcony in the moonlight. WILL gasps. He watches her. 
       VIOLA sighs dreamily.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of 
                 Verona. A comedy. By William 
                 Shakespeare.

       WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of 
       hiding, and approaches the balcony.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (whispers)
                 My lady!

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (gasps)
                 Who is there?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Will Shakespeare!

       The NURSE calls "Madam!" from inside the room.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Anon, good nurse. Anon.
                     (to WILL)
                 Master Shakespeare?!

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 The same, alas.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Oh but why "alas?"

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 A lowly player.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Alas indeed, for I thought you the 
                 highest poet of my esteem and a writer 
                 of plays that capture my heart.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Oh--I am him too!

       The NURSE calls again.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (to NURSE)
                 Anon, anon!
                     (to WILL)
                 I will come again.

       She goes inside for a moment.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (to himself)
                 Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be 
                 punished for this!

       VIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 Oh my lady, my love!

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 If they find you here they will kill 
                 you.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 You can bring them with a word.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Oh, not for the world!

       The NURSE calls her again: "Madam!"

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 Anon, nurse!

       But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that 
       there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb 
       up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a 
       soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops 
       his head over the parapet and is face to face with the 
       NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the 
       tree.

<b>       EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.
</b>
       Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle 
       flames appear in different windows, the garden door is 
       flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one 
       hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top 
       of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He 
       could have written it better.

<b>       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN.
</b>
       WILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and 
       metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen 
       sheets. He is inspired.

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
</b>
       It is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing 
       pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are 
       looking through their pages.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>                 "Draw if you be men!
                     (to JAMES)
                 Gregory, remember thy washing blow."

<b>                           NOL
</b>                 "Part, fools, put up your swords."

       WILL is going around pumping hands and slapping 
       shoulders, flushed with excitement. HENSLOWE is reading 
       his pages, worried. RALPH BASHFORD is next to him.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 It starts well, and then it's all long-
                 faced about some Rosaline. Where's the 
                 comedy, Will. Where's the dog?
                     (to RALPH)
                 Do you think it is funny?

<b>                           RALPH
</b>                 I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse. 
                 That's funny

       WILL pulls HENSLOWE aside.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 We are at least six men short, and 
                 those we have will be overparted, 
                 ranters and stutterers who should be 
                 sent back to the stews. My Romeo has 
                 let me down. I see disaster.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 We are at least four acts short, Will, 
                 if you are looking for disaster.

       WILL as notices a young scruffy thirteen-year-old actor, 
       the URCHIN we met before.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Who are you, master?

<b>                           URCHIN
</b>                 I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's 
                 daughter.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (furiously)
                 I'll be damned if you are!

       And he helps the URCHIN off with a kick. The URCHIN 
       glowers with resentment. HENSLOWE finds himself face to 
       face with FENNYMAN.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Is it going well?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Very well.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 But nothing is happening.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Yes, but very well.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (shouts)
                 Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Who is that?

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Nobody. The author.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 We are about to embark on a great 
                 voyage.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 It is customary to make a little 
                 speech on the first day. It does no 
                 harm and authors like it.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 You want to know what parts you are to 
                 receive. All will be settled as we go

       That's as far as he gets before there is a dramatic 
       interruption--the public entrance door is flung open and 
       SIX MEN make a loud entrance, headed by NED ALLEYN, the 
       actor, who is a handsome piratical figure with a big 
       voice and a big sword.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 Huzzah! The Admiral's Men are returned 
                 to the house!

       He gets various reactions. HENSLOWE and WILL shout his 
       name joyfully, some of the actors are friends with the 
       new group and behave accordingly, others know they are 
       out of a job. FENNYMAN recovers, or tries to.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Who is this?

       ALLEYN slaps him aside with his sword.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                     (roars)
                 Silence, you god! I am Hieronimo! I am 
                 Tamburlaine! I am Faustus! I am 
                 Barrabas, the Jew of Malta--of yes, 
                 Master Will, and I am Henry VI. What 
                 is the play, and what is my part?

       FENNYMAN is impressed.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 A moment, sir!

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                     (roars)
                 Who are you?

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                     (bleating)
                 I am the money!

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 Then you may remain so long as you 
                 remain silent. Pay attention and you 
                 will see how genius creates a legend.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                     (respectfully)
                 Thank you, sir.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 We are in desperate want of a 
                 Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of 
                 Verona

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 And the title of this piece?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Mercutio

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Is it?

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 I will play him!

       Half a dozen of the ADMIRAL'S MEN will be given roles in 
       our play and we meet them and identify them as WILL 
       enthusiastically shakes hands.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome,

                     (and now greeting SAM GOSSE, 
                      the female star of the 
                      Admiral's Men)
                 Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to 
                 fall in love again?

<b>                           SAM

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (concerned)
                 But your voice
                     (he thrust a hand between 
                      SAM'S legs)
                 Have they dropped?

<b>                           SAM
</b>                     (a girlie voice now)
                 No, no, a touch of cold only. We 
                 suspect he is lying but WILL has 
                 turned away.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Master Henslowe, you have your actors.

       He leaves, passing by the humbled FENNYMAN.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. 
                 Wonderful.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Yes, I saw it.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Of course, it was mighty writing. 
                 There is no one like Marlowe

       WILL is used to it. He goes.

<b>       EXT. RIVERBANK. DAY.
</b>
       WILL arrives in a hurry at the wharfside, and looks 
       vainly in the direction of the DE LESSEPSES' house: no 
<b>       THOMAS.
</b>
<b>       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE DOOR. DAY.
</b>
       WILL looks down the alley:--no THOMAS. He turns away. The 
       URCHIN, the short-lived Ethel, is sitting in the alley.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Better fortune, boy.

<b>                           URCHIN
</b>                     (shrugs)
                 I was in a play. They cut my head off 
                 in Titus Andronicus. When I write 
                 plays, they will be like Titus.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (pleased)
                 You admire it?

       The URCHIN nods grimly.

<b>                           URCHIN
</b>                 I like it when they cut heads off. And 
                 the daughter mutilated with knives.

       Because a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest. 
       The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches 
       the result with sober interest.

<b>                           URCHIN (CONT'D)

       anxious.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 A sonnet? You mean a play.

       WILL moves on, ignoring him. As he goes, we see that 
       VIOLA is love-struck by him, a riot in the heart.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. STAIRCASE. DAY.
</b>
       VIOLA still dressed as THOMAS, sonnet in hand, runs up 
       the stairs to her room. From the other end of the house 
       WESSEX can be heard ranting.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT.
</b>
       LORD WESSEX is being kept waiting. The NURSE is bearing 
       the brunt of his impatience.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Two hours at prayer!

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at 
                 prayer is not piety, it is self-
                 importance!

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 It would be better that you return 
                 tomorrow, my lord.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 It would be better that you tell her 
                 to get off her knees and show some 
                 civility to her six-day lord and 
                 master.

       VIOLA opens the door. She has changed hurriedly--too 
       hurriedly: the effect of her glorious hair falling to her 
       bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache. Fortunately, 
       the NURSE spots her before WESSEX does and by coming 
       forward to greet her, the NURSE manages to shield Viola 
       from view, communicate the problem, and announce WESSEX'S 
       presence, so that by the time the NURSE has passed by 
       VIOLA and let herself out of the room, the moustache has 
       disappeared.

<b>                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>                 My lady VIOLA.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 I am aware of it, but it is beauty's 
                 privilege.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 You flatter, my lord.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 No. I have spoken to the Queen.
                     (pause)
                 Her majesty's consent is requisite 
                 when a Wessex takes a wife, and once 
                 gained, her consent is her command.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Do you intend to marry, my lord?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Your father should keep you better 
                 informed. He has bought me for you. He 
                 returns from his estates to see us 
                 married two weeks from Saturday.
                     (pause)
                 You are allowed to show your pleasure.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 I do not love you, my lord.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 How your mind hops about! Your father 
                 was a shopkeeper, your children will 
                 bear arms, and I will recover my 
                 fortune. That is the only matter under 
                 discussion today. You will like 
                 Virginia.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Virginia?!

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Why, yes! My fortune lies in my 
                 plantations. The tobacco weed. I need 
                 four thousand pounds to fit out a ship 
                 and put my investments to work--I fancy 
                 tobacco has a future. We will not stay 
                 there long, three or four years . . .

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 But why me?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 It was your eyes. No, your lips.

       He kisses her with more passion than ceremony. VIOLA 
       recoils, and slaps him.

<b>                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>                 Will you defy your father and your 
                 Queen?

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 The Queen has consented?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 She wants to inspect you. At 
                 Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, 
                 modest, grateful and brief.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (forced to submit)
                 I will do my duty, my lord.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
       She is writing to WILL. His letter-poem is on her table. 
       We can read part of it. "Shall I compare thee to a 
       summer's day…"

       Now we see what VIOLA is writing.

       INSERT: "Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I beseech 
       you, banish me from yours--I am to marry Lord Wessex-- a 
       daughter's duty… "

       She sheds a romantic, unhappy tear.

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
</b>
       SAM is now "JULIET." The play has evidently reached Act I 
       Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of "ROMEO" and 
       "JULIET" in a simplified version of the changing-partners 
       dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage!

       The dance goes wrong. it is THOMAS'S fault.

<b>                           ALLEYN (CONT'D)
</b>                     (furious)
                 Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage! 
                 Are you a lady, Mr. Kent?

       THOMAS mutters a blushing apology. WILL arrives the 
       bystanders, clutching fresh pages. He gives these to 
       PETER. NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an 
       argument.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (preempting)
                 You did not like the speech?

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 The speech is excellent.
                     (he does the first line 
                      impressively)
                 "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been 
                 with you!" Excellent and a good 
                 length. But then he disappears for the 
                 length of a bible.

       WILL points significantly at the pages he has given 
<b>       PETER.
</b>
<b>                           WILL
</b>                 There you have his duel, a skirmish of 
                 words and swords such as I never 
                 wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such 
                 passion and poetry as your ever heard: 
                 "a plague on both your houses!"

       NED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns 
       back.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 He dies?

       But the author has escaped.

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.
</b>
       Up aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down 
       to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round 
       in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the 
       floor. That done, he picks up his pen.

<b>       EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into 
       BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 Will!

       WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls 
       after him.

<b>                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
</b>                 And where are my pages . . .

       WILL hurries on.

<b>       EXT. RIVERBANK. DUSK.
</b>
       VIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From 
       behind, in the direction of Bankside, "he" hears 
       shouting.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (O.S. shouting)
                 Did you give her my letter?

       VIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind, 
       following in another boat. She takes a letter from her 
       coat and holds it aloft.

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                     (calling)
                 And this for you.

<b>       EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open 
       the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He 
       collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I 
                 am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, 
                 like a puppet in a box.

<b>                           BOATMAN
</b>                 Writer, is he?

       WILL turns on him savagely

</b>                 Row your boat.

<b>       EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation 
       intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The 
       BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore 
       him.

<b>                           WILL

</b>                 She loves me, Thomas!

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 Does she say so?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 No. And yet she does where the ink has 
                 run with tears. Was she weeping when 
                 she gave you this?

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 I … Her letter came to me by the 
                 nurse.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Your aunt?

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                     (catching up)
                 Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a 
                 little. Tell me how you love her, 
                 Will.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Like a sickness and its cure together.

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and 
                 heat.
                     (collecting herself)
                 Is your lady beautiful? Since I came 
                 to visit from the country, I have not 
                 seen her close. Tell me, is she 
                 beautiful?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Oh, if I could write the beauty of her 
                 eyes! I was born to look in them and 
                 know myself.

       He is looking into VIOLA'S eyes. She holds his look, but 
       WILL belies his words.

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 And her lips?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early 
                 morning rose would wither on the 
                 branch, if it could feel envy!

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 And her voice? Like lark song?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Deeper. Softer. None of your 
                 twittering larks! I would banish 
                 nightingales from her garden before 
                 they interrupt her song.

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 She sings too?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Constantly. Without doubt. And plays 
                 the lute, she has a natural ear. And 
                 her bosom--did I mention her bosom?

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                     (glinting)
                 What of her bosom?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round 
                 and rare as golden apples!

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 I think the lady is wise to keep your 
                 love at a distance. For what lady 
                 could live up to it close to, when her 
                 eyes and lips and voice may be no more 
                 beautiful than mine? Besides, can a 
                 lady born to wealth and noble marriage 
                 love happily with a Bankside poet and 
                 player?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (fervently)
                 Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of 
                 rank or riverbank! It will spark 
                 between a queen and the poor vagabond 
                 who plays the king, and their love 
                 should be minded by each, for love 
                 denied blights the soul we owe to God! 
                 So tell my lady, William Shakespeare 
                 waits for her in the garden!

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                 But what of Lord Wessex?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 For one kiss, I would defy a thousand 
                 Wessexes!

       The boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house. 
       The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her 
       round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her. 
       The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth 
       and jumps out of the boat.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Oh, Will!

       She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the 
       house.

<b>                           BOATMAN
</b>                 Thank you, my lady!

<b>                           WILL

<b>                           BOATMAN
</b>                 Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she 
                 was this high. Wouldn't deceive a 
                 child.

       WILL gets out of the boat.

<b>                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)
</b>                     (reaching under his seat)
                 Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a 
                 writer myself.

       The BOATMAN produces his memoirs in manuscript.

<b>                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)

                 I expect you know all the booksellers 
<b>                 . . .
</b>
       But WILL has gone.

<b>       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' GARDEN. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL drops over the wall into the garden and without 
       hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL comes in through the window, just as VIOLA enters by 
       the door. They stare at each other across the room.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Can you love a fool?

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Can you love a player?

       They run together and fall into a passionate kiss.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (springs back)
                 Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps 
                 as mistook in me as I was mistook in 
                 Thomas Kent.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Answer me only this: are you the 
                 author of the plays of William 
                 Shakespeare?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I am.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Then kiss me again for I am not 
                 mistook.

       They run together and fall into a passionate kiss. VIOLA 
       fumbles with his clothing, he with hers.

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 I do not know how to undress a man.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 It is strange to me, too.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
       The NURSE has come to listen. She puts her ear against 
       the door. Because she hears muffled voices, she looks 
       startled.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL is half-naked. VIOLA is down to her petticoat, and 
       chemise. The petticoat comes away. WILL flings it aside. 
       He takes off her chemise. He is startled to find that she 
       is tightly bandaged round the bosom. WILL finds the loose 
       end and spins her naked.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
       The NURSE, drags a chair--a rocker--outside the bedroom 
       door, and takes up her position. She sits down, keeping 
       guard. Pretty soon there comes the regular creak of 
       VIOLA'S bed. The NURSE fans herself furiously with her 
       little lacy fan. She crosses herself. A CHAMBERMAID comes 
       along the gallery outside the bedroom door. She is 
       dusting her way along. The CHAMBERMAID becomes aware of 
       the regular creaking. She pauses. The NURSE begins to 
       rock in her chair, keeping time with the creaking from 
       within. The CHAMBERMAID stares at the NURSE. The NURSE 
       stares at the CHAMBERMAID.

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 Go to, go to.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</b>
       WILL and VIOLA have finished making love, and lie in each 
       other's arms.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 I would not have thought it. There is 
                 something better than a play.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 There is.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Even your play.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (frowns)
                 Oh

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 And that was only my first try.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Well perhaps better than my first.
                     (he kisses her again)

<b>       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAWN.
</b>
       Dawn is breaking. The sun lacing the severing clouds with 
       envious streaks.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN
</b>
       The NURSE has fallen asleep in her rocking chair.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.
</b>
       A rooster crows at some distance. VIOLA and WILL are in 
       bed. She stirs drowsily. VIOLA, coming awake, speaks his 
       name and he kisses her.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Will

       Then he starts to get out of bed.

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 You would not leave me?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I must. Look-- how pale the window.

<b>                           VIOLA

                 Moonlight!

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 No, the morning rooster woke me.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 It was the owl--come to bed

       She is winning. She kisses him and pulls the bedclothes 
       around them.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (giving in)
                 Oh, let Henslowe wait.

<b>                           VIOLA

                 Mr. Henslowe?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (persisting)

<b>                           WILL

                 There is time. It is still dark.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 It is broad day!
                     (the rooster crows again)
                 The rooster tells us so!

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 It was the owl. Believe me, love, it 
                 was the owl.

       He kisses her and starts to make love to her again. VIOLA 
       gives him a shove which pushes him onto the floor. She 
       sits up and pulls on her gown.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 You would leave us players without a 
                 scene to read today?!

       There's a knock at the door.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VIOLA'S

       The NURSE is knocking. VIOLA comes to the door.

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 My lady, the house is stirring, it is 
                 a new day.

       VIOLA looks beautified by the hours that have passed.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 It is a new world!

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
</b>
       The cut is to the middle of a rehearsal. We are coming up 
       to the moment when "ROMEO" and "JULIET" kiss for the 
       first time (Act I Scene V) NED ALLEYN is in charge but 
       WILL is watching. His life has turned perfect.

<b>                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
</b>                 "…Have not saints lips, and holy 
                 palmers too?"

<b>                           SAM AS JULIET
</b>                 "Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use 
                 in prayer."

<b>                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
</b>                 "Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what 
                 hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest 
                 faith turn to despair."

       WILL is in her eye-line. Her eyes flash an intimate 
       secret look to him.

<b>                           SAM AS JULIET
</b>                 "Saints do not move, though grant for 
                 prayer's sake."

       And VIOLA misses her cue as a result.

<b>                           SAM
</b>                     (prompting her)
                 It's you.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                     (roars)
                 Suffering cats!

       VIOLA guiltily picks up her line.

<b>                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
</b>                 "Then move not, while my prayer's 
                 effect I take."

       In character, VIOLA kisses SAM, demurely, but apparently 
       not demurely enough for WILL, who gives a twitch.

<b>                           VIOLA AS ROMEO(CONT'D)
</b>                 "Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin 
                 is purg'd."

<b>                           SAM AS JULIET
</b>                 "Then have my lips the sin that they 
                 have took."

<b>                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
</b>                 "Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly 
                 urg'd. Give me my sin again."

       VIOLA kisses SAM again. WILL gives a major twitch, which 
       in fact catapults his body onto the stage. Everybody 
       looks at him in surprise.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Yes…yes…er…not quite right…it is more

                 urg'd. Give me my sin again."

       VIOLA kisses WILL. They lose themselves for a fraction of 
       a moment. As VIOLA withdraws her lips, WILL'S lips are 
       going for it again.

<b>                           VIOLA AS ROMEO (CONT'D)

       WILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's 
       corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands 
       together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all 
       over the table. 
       We take a peak at the lines he has already written.

       We see that a group of the other actors have drifted "out

                 You mean, no dog of any kind?

       FENNYMAN, the born-again theatre groupie shushes HENSLOWE 
       and looks daggers at him.

<b>                           PETER
</b>                     (to HENSLOWE)
                 The Friar married them in secret, then 
                 Ned gets into a fight with one of the 
                 Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he 
                 gets in Ned's way, I mean in 
                 Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills 
                 Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt. 
                 Then the Prince banishes him from 
                 Verona.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (much relieved)
                 That must be when he goes on the 
                 voyage and gets shipwrecked on the 
                 island of the Pirate King.

       FENNYMAN can't hear it. He storms over. Kicks the dog, 
       roars at HENSLOWE .

<b>                           FENNYMAN

       A sunbeam wakes the lovers. Sunday morning. Church bells. 
       VIOLA wakes with a start. Something is bothering her, she 
       can't think what. WILL calms her.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Sunday…it is Sunday.

       He brings her back down to the pillow.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 I found something in my sleep. The 
                 Friar who married them will take up 
                 their destinies.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Oh, but it will end well for love?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy 
                 I am writing now. A broad river 
                 divides my lovers--family, duty, 
                 fate--as unchangeable as nature.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (sobered)
                 Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a 
                 stolen season.

       Suddenly there is a great racket heard from downstairs…a 
       man shouting.

<b>                           WESSEX (O.S.)
</b>                 Not ready? Where is she?

</b>                 Will you ask Her Majesty to be 
                 patient?!

                 festivities, to bestow her gracious 
                 favour on my choice of wife--and if 
                 we're late for lunch, the old boot 
                 will not forgive. So you get you to my

       VIOLA has her dress on and is putting on her shoes. WILL, 
       in his underwear is in mid-argument.

                 free to follow my desire in the harsh

                 belongs to you but as Viola the river 
                 divides us, and I will marry Wessex a

       The ranting from WESSEX has continued

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (ranting)
                 By heaven, I will drag her down, by 
                 the Queen's command

       And is cut off short as VIOLA'S door opens at the top of 
       the stairs.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Good morning, my lord!

<b>                           WESSEX

                 man, but I swear it would wait for 
                 you!

       VIOLA comes down the stairs. Behind her WILL appears 
       gowned and bonneted. He has also assumed a country 
       accent.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps

<b>                           WILL

<b>       EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. NIGHT.
</b>
       Fireworks explode in the evening sky over Greenwich, a 
       royal palace, crowded now with noble guests.

<b>       EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. TERRACE. NIGHT.
</b>
       The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about, 
       chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while 
       QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes 
       through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with 
       a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the 
       best chair…where she establishes a headquarters. Her 
       current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to 
       a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the 
       next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and 
       bowing as they are greeted by people who know them…Will, 
       in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until 
       VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The 
       QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (to him)
                 Now?

<b>                           LORD IN WAITING
</b>                 Now.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (to Viola)
                 The Queen asks for you. Answer well.

       The LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL 
       starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm.

<b>                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>                 Is there a man?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 A man, my lord?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (impatiently)
                 There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, 
                 I heard--does he come to the house?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 A theatre poet?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 An insolent penny-a-page rogue, 
                 Marlowe, he said, Christopher 
                 Marlowe--has he been to the house?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely 
                 waistcoat, shame about the poetry.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (venomously)
                 That dog!

       ANGLE on the QUEEN.

       The LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks 
       from a frozen curtsey.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Your Majesty.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 Stand up straight, girl.

       VIOLA straightens. The QUEEN examines her.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
</b>                 I have seen you. You are the one who 
                 comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, 
                 at Richmond.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (agreeing)
                 Your Majesty.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 What do you love so much?

<b>                           VIOLA

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 Speak out! I know who I am. Do you 
                 love stories of kings and queens? 
                 Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 I love theatre. To have stories acted 
                 for me by a company of fellows is 
                 indeed

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                     (interrupting)
                 They are not acted for you, they are 
                 acted for me.

       VIOLA remains silent, in apology.

       ANGLE on WILL.

       He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN 
       so close. He is fascinated.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
</b>                 And--?

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 And I love poetry above all.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 Above Lord Wessex?

       She looks over VIOLA'S shoulder and VIOLA realises WESSEX 
       has moved up behind her. WESSEX bows.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
</b>                     (to WESSEX)
                 My Lord--when you cannot find your wife 
                 you had better look for her at the 
                 playhouse.

       The COURTIERS titter at her pleasantry.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
</b>                 But playwrights teach nothing about 
                 love, they make it pretty, they make 
                 it comical, or they make it lust. They 
                 cannot make it true.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (blurts)
                 Oh, but they can!

       She has forgotten herself. The COURTIERS gasp. The QUEEN 
       considers her. WESSEX looks furious. WILL is touched.

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they 
                 have not, but I believe there is one 
                 who can

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your 
                 Majesty is wise in it. 
                 Nature and truth are the very enemies 
                 of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 I thought you were here because you 
                 had none.

       Titters again. WESSEX could kill somebody.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
</b>                     (by way of dismissing him)
                 Well, no one will take your wager, it 
                 seems.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Fifty pounds!

       Shock and horror. QUEEN ELIZABETH is the only person 
       amused.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a 
                 very worthy question. Can a play show 
                 us the very truth and nature of love? 
                 I bear witness to the wager, and will 
                 be the judge of it as occasion arises.
                     (which wins a scatter of 
                      applause. She gathers her 
                      skirts and stands)
                 I have not seen anything to settle it 
                 yet.
                     (she moves away, everybody 
                      bowing and scraping)
                 So--the fireworks will be soothing 
                 after the excitements of Lady Viola's 
                 audience.
                     (and now she is next to 
                      WESSEX who is bowing low. 
                      Intimately to him)
                 Have her then, but you are a lordly 
                 fool. She has been plucked since I saw 
                 her last, and not by you. It takes a 
                 woman to know it.

       The QUEEN passes by, and as WESSEX comes vertical again, 
       we see his face a mask of furious realisation.

       CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE shuts the door behind him. Above him,

       MARLOWE enters, ignoring the situation on the bed where

</b>                 Treachery!

       BURBAGE rouses himself violently, throwing ROSALINE off 
       the bed. The glass bracelet is flung from her wrist. It 
       breaks on the floor, releasing a strip of paper. BURBAGE 
       picks it up. What he reads on it does not please him: it 
       is WILL'S signature.

<b>                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
</b>                 Traitor and thief!

<b>       EXT. STREETS. DAY.
</b>
       BURBAGE and a solid wedge of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEND are 
       cleaving a path through the crowds. Their faces are grim.

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM/UNDER THE STAGE. 
</b><b>       DAY.
</b>
       We are in Act III Scene I. NED ALLEYN as "MERCUTIO" and 
       NOL as "BENVOLIO", and two "MONTAGUE" sidekicks are in 
       occupation of the stage, when the "CAPULETS" swagger in, 
       four of them headed by JAMES HEMMINGS as "TYBALT."

<b>                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
</b>                 "By my head, here comes the Capulets."

<b>                           ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO
</b>                 "By my heel, I care not."

<b>                           JAMES HEMMINGS AS TYBALT
</b>                 "Follow me close, for I will speak to 
                 them. (with bombast to "MERCUTIO") 
                 Gentlemen, good e'en: a word with one 
                 of you."

       NED comes out of character.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 Are you going to do it like that? And 
                 before the humbled actor can reply NED 
                 continues.

<b>                           ALLEYN (AS MECUTIO)
</b>                 And but one word with one of us? 
                 Couple it with something, make it a 
                 word and a blow.

       But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, 
       ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have 
       arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs, 
       and a bucket (containing pig swill).

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 Where is that thieving hack who can't 
                 keep his pen in his own ink pot!?

       WILL has already leapt up onto the stage.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 What is this rabble?!

       BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave 
       from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. 
       He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL, 
       THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings 
       bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S 
       MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed 
       skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using 
       everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is 
       yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE, 
       a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the 
       page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up, 
       watches enthralled.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                     (to HENSLOWE)
                 Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!

       But now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't 
       belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his 
       interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is 
       using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one 
       of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Not with my props!

       VIOLA is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a 
       well-judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow 
       aimed at WILL

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Will! What--?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 A literary feud. Quite normal.

       Then he is smashed over the head. He falls off the stage 
       taking VIOLA with him. Under the stage is a space (known 
       as Hell) and WILL shoves VIOLA into this space.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 Stay hid!

       He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are 
       worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, 
       with SAM GOSSE, dressed as "JULIET," fighting with the 
       best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for 
       the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED 
       ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon 
       cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying 
       feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head 
       pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs 
       and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and 
       half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover 
       blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just 
       nicely for Will to plummet down it.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. 
                 You were cast ashore in a far country.

       They embrace and kiss. In a moment they are in a world of 
       their own.

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.
</b>
       The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium, 
       continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's 
       ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd 
       props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks 
       up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 We need that for the balcony scene!

       FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He 
       looks around the realises that some of these faces are 
       unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head. 
       FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE.

<b>                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
</b>                     (in despair)
                 My poor Rose!

       He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to 
       him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults 
       them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that 
       this scene is not in them.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                     (horrified)
                 My investment! LAMBERT!!!

       LAMBERT has been sleeping peacefully through this, but 
       wakes to his master's call.

<b>                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
</b>                     (points at the fray)
<b>                 VENGEANCE!
</b>
       HENSLOWE attempts to intervene.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. 
                 As I explained to you, the theatre 
                 business

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my 
                 business I would be out of business if 
                 I had your courage, so don't tell me 
                 about business

       And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S 
       MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is 
       making short work of the rest of the opposition, 
       receiving help with the thorny business of identification 
       from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are 
       running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic 
       last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage 
       and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts 
       applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start 
       applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN 
       looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and 
       bravos engulf him. A star!

<b>       INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.
</b>
       The victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel, 
       FENNYMAN at their head. He owns the brothel. The place is 
       already crowded with WHORES and CUSTOMERS. It's a party.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                     (shouts)
                 A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open 
                 and on the house! Oh what happy hour!
                     (and grabbing a RADDLED 
<b>                      WHORE)
</b>                 Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to 
                 yourself I'll not have you infecting 
                 my investment!

<b>                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
</b>                     (looking around guardedly. To 
<b>                      WILL)
</b>                 Is this a tavern?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 It is also a tavern.

       WILL sits her down in THE COMPANY and takes the chair 
       next to her A PRETTY WHORE immediately sits on WILL'S 
       knee and kisses him.

<b>                           PRETTY WHORE
</b>                 I remember you! The poet!

       VIOLA furiously pulls the PRETTY WHORE off WILL'S lap.

<b>                           PRETTY WHORE (CONT'D)
</b>                 One at a time, one at a time!

                 repute!

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. 
                 Come, there is no harm in a drink.

       Glasses are shoved into their hands. Everyone has a 
       glass. Except RALPH

<b>                           RALPH
</b>                     (declining the glass)
                 Never when I'm working!

       The PRETTY WHORE has turned her attention to SAM. SAM 
       looks uncomfortable

<b>                           PRETTY WHORE

                     (groping him)

       FENNYMAN shouts a toast.

                 Here's to the Admiral's Men!

       Everybody drinks. VIOLA drinks too. She decides too. She 
       decides to enjoy it. She bangs down her glass.

<b>       EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
</b>
       A figure is running desperately through the streets. He 
       comes into the square and runs towards the Rose.

<b>       EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.
</b>
       Half THE COMPANY are singing. NOL and a WHORE are 
       tumbling down the stairs together. He is without his 
       trousers. An awful lot of drink has gone down.

<b>                           SAM

                 I…quite liked it.

       VIOLA, bright eyed, is banging her glass on the table in 
       time to a song which is being drunkenly delivered by a 
       barbershop quartet of actors.

       FENNYMAN reels into VIOLA.

<b>                           FENNYMAN

       In his general enthusiasm, he embraces the next man, who 
       is RALPH, stone cold sober.

<b>                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)

       FENNYMAN, beside himself, shouts for silence, announcing

       That goes down every well with the entire COMPANY…except 
       for VIOLA and WILL. He looks at her, helplessly, then 
       makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him 
       and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears. 
       VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street. 
       WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the 
       shoulders by PETER…who, we now see, is in a highly 
       emotional state. WILL tries to fight him off but PETER 
       has the strength of the news he brings.

<b>                           PETER
</b>                     (shouts)
                 Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

       He brings the room to silence.

<b>                           PETER (CONT'D)
</b>                 A black day for us all! There is news 
                 come up river from Deptford. Marlowe 
                 is dead.

       There are general gasps and cries for information.

<b>                           PETER (CONT'D)
</b>                 Stabbed! Stabbed to death in a tavern 
                 at Deptford!

       No one is more affected than WILL. This second blow is 
       worse than the first. He stands horror-stricken.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Oh…what have I done?

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                     (standing up)
                 He was the first man among us. A great 
                 light has gone out.

<b>       EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.
</b>
       WILL comes staggering out into the street.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 It was I who killed him! God forgive 
                 me, God forgive me!

       He falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water 
       and garbage. He gets up and staggers on.

<b>       EXT. CHURCH TOWER. NIGHT.
</b>
       A church tower looms up in the night sky.

<b>       INT. CHURCH. NIGHT.
</b>
       This is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for 
       the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling, 
       praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private 
       purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by 
       effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is 
       wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.

<b>       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
       A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing. 
       VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides 
       sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather 
       like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive 
       animal. 

       Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a 
       happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily. 
       Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA 
       and greets her merrily.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 You look sad, my lady! Let me take you 
                 riding.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 It is not my riding day, my lord.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 I am going to church.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (recomposing his features to 
                      solemnity)
                 I understand of course. It is to be 
                 expected.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 It is to be expected on a Sunday.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 And on a day of mourning. I never met 
                 the fellow but once at your house.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (cannot take this in)
                 Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would 
                 be me to tell you. A great loss to 
                 playwriting, and to dancing.

       VIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (faintly)
                 He is dead?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (cheerfully solemn)
                 Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, 
                 then, we'll say a prayer for his soul

       VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in 
       distress.

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 My lady…my lady…now is the time to 
                 show your breeding.

<b>       INT. CHURCH. DAY.
</b>
       The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church. 
       VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat 
       and sits down next to her. 

       As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is 
       sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. 
       He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns 
       him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE.

       ANGLE on WILL. 

       WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great 
       shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of 
       times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has 
       banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he 
       stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX. 

       WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering 
       accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to 
       mumble.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for 
                 the love of Christ!

       Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at 
       first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment 
       as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally 
       running in terror.

<b>                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>                     (screaming)
                 Spare me!

       The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA 
       to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is 
       leaving.

<b>       EXT. CHURCH. DAY.
</b>
       Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the 
       church. She calls his name.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Will!

       He does not answer. She runs after him.

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!

       She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment 
       then WILL pulls back.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 It is worse. I have killed a man.

<b>       EXT. MEADOW. DAY.
</b>
       VIOLA'S horse grazes. WILL lies on his back, still 
       sobered and full of guilt. VIOLA sits on the grass among 
       the buttercups and looks down at him. 
       VIOLA is plaiting a finger-ring from stems of grass. She 
       has not yet revealed her feelings.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Marlowe's touch was in my Titus 
                 Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house 
                 built on his foundations.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 You never spoke so well of him.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 He was not dead before. I would 
                 exchange all my plays to come for all 
                 of his that will never come.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 You lie.

       WILL turns to look at her.

<b>                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
</b>                 You lie in your meadow as you lied in 
                 my bed.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, 
                 and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir 
                 Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife 
                 come from Stratford to tell you that. 
                 And yet you let me come to your bed.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Calf love. I loved the writer, and 
                 gave up the prize for a sonnet.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I was the more deceived.

<b>                           VOILA
</b>                 Yes--you were deceived. For I never 
                 loved you till now.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Now?

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (declaring herself)
                 I love you, Will, beyond poetry.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 Oh, my love
                     (he kisses her)
                 You ran from me before.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 You were not dead before. When I 
                 thought you dead, I did not care about 
                 all the plays that will never come, 
                 only that I would never see your face. 
                 I saw our end, and it will come.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 You cannot marry Wessex!

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 If not Wessex the Queen will know the 
                 cause and there will be no more Will 
                 Shakespeare.

       They kiss again, passionately.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 No…no.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (through his kisses)
                 But I will go to Wessex as a widow 
                 from these vows, as solemn as they are 
                 unsanctified.

       And as their desperate kisses turn into lovemaking we cut 
       to:

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
</b>
<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (he is mid speech)
                 For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, 
                 the one who killed Romeo's friend 
                 Mercutio, Romeo is banished

       He is on the stage of the Rose. The entire COMPANY is 
       assembled, HENSLOWE and FENNYMAN included, holding pages 
       of manuscript, which they are sharing together, examining 
       the separated pages, passing pages to each other, etc. 
       WILL'S mood is intense and focused.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 but the Friar who married Romeo and 
                 Juliet

<b>                           ACTOR (EDWARD)
</b>                 Is that me. Will?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 You, Edward. The Friar who married 
                 them gives Juliet a potion to drink. 
                 It is a secret potion. It makes her 
                 seeming dead. She is placed in the 
                 tomb of the Capulets. She will awake 
                 to life and love when Romeo comes to 
                 her side again.

       THE COMPANY murmurs approval.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 I have not said all. By malign fate, 
                 the message goes astray which would 
                 tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He 
                 hears only that Juliet is dead. And 
                 thus he goes to the Apothecary.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 That's me.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 And buys a deadly poison. He enters 
                 the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who 
                 lies there cold as death. He drinks 
                 the poison. He dies by her side. And 
                 then she wakes and sees him dead.

       HENSLOWE is fascinated and appalled.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 And so Juliet takes his dagger and 
                 kills herself.

<b>       PAUSE.
</b>
       WILL is staring at VIOLA

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Well, that will have them rolling in 
                 the aisles.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Sad and wonderful! I have a blue 
                 velvet cap which will do well, I have 
                 seen apothecary with a cap just so.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                     (to WILL)
                 Yes--it will serve. But there's a scene 
                 missing between marriage and death.

       WILL is still staring at VIOLA. Aware, suddenly, of the 
       others watching, she breaks his gaze and drops her head. 
       WILL looks at NED.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.
</b>
       WILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present 
       for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on 
       sheets folded to octavo size.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 The play. All written out for you. I 
                 had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he 
                 has a good fist for lettering.

       She wants to accept the present with joy, but something 
       in his mood restrains her.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 There's a new scene

       He turns the pages and shows her.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Will you read it for me?

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (he knows it)
                 "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near 
                 day> It was the nightingale and not 
                 the lark That pierced the fearful 
                 hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings 
                 on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, 
                 love, it was the nightingale."

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (reading)
                 "It was the lark, the herald of the 
                 morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what 
                 envious streaks Do lace the severing 
                 clouds in yonder east. Night's candles 
                 are burnt out, and jocund day Stands 
                 tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I 
                 must be gone and live, or stay and 
                 die."

       The words of the scene become WILL'S and VIOLA'S, their 
       way of saying the farewells they cannot utter.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 "Yon light is not daylight, I know it, 
                 I. It is some meteor that the sun 
                 exhales To be to thee this night a 
                 torchbearer…"

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
</b>
       But the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as 
       "THOMAS." Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a 
       deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc., 
       they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether 
       it is rehearsal or lovemaking. But after a few moments it 
       is definitely lovemaking. Their clothes start coming 
       away, their words interrupted by kisses.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 "…thou need'st not to be gone."

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 "I have more care to stay than will to 
                 go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet 
                 wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's 
                 talk. It is not day."

       By now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away 
       and WILL passionately embraces her nakedness. 

       And into this heaving composition comes a little white 
       mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in 
       the planking behind VIOLA'S head. 

       An adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not 
       need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S. 

       WEBSTER takes his eye away from the peephole, and frowns, 
       thinking it out.

<b>       EXT. ALLEWAY. DAY.

       TILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand.

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 You will go far, I fear.

<b>                           TILNEY (CONT'D)

                 walks away.

<b>       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.
</b>
       A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is 
       muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is 
       FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary, 
       for which he has a special voice.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's 
                 law Is death to any he that utters 
                 them." Then him. Then me.

       "Put this in any liquid thing you will And…"--something

       He has dried up. He curses--the terror and despair.

<b>                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
</b>                 "Such mortal drugs I have…" What is 
                 it? What is it?

       He is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not 
       notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance 
       dismounts and walks inside.

<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
</b>
       Onstage, the rehearsal continues. WESSEX strides in. 
       Among the audience are HENSLOWE, a few actors…and JOHN 
       WEBSTER…who sees WESSEX and jumps up and goes to him.

<b>                           WEBSTER
</b>                 My lord!

       WESSEX knocks him aside and continues.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (shouts)
                 Shakespeare!

       Everything stops.

<b>                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>                 You upstart inky pup! Now I will show 
                 you your place, which is in hell!

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 You are on my ground.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (drawing his sword)
                 By God, I'll fight the lot of you

       WILL draws his sword.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                 I am more than enough.

       VIOLA reacts. She almost gives herself away. But the 
       fight has started. 

       WESSEX slashes at WILL. WILL knows how to fight. He 
       parries and thrusts. WESSEX is surprised. The fight goes 
       fast and furious around the stage, until WILL thrusts 
       accurately at WESSEX'S chest…and would have killed him 
       but for the button on his sword-point. 

       WESSEX grapples with him, and now it becomes a parody of 
       the Hamlet duel; WESSEX'S unbuttoned sword falls to the 
       ground, WILL puts his foot on it, tosses WESSEX his own 
       safe sword, picks up Wessex's sword and continues the 
       fight until he has WESSEX at his mercy. 

       WILL has fought with a passionate rage that has everybody 
       staring at him. Now the look in his eyes is merciless.

<b>                           WILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 Absent friends!
                     (to the assembly)
                 This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

       NED ALLEYN comes forward looking worried and dubious.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 Will

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 I rejoiced at his death because I 
                 thought it was yours. That is all I 
                 know of Marlowe.

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 It's true, Will--it was a tavern 
                 brawl…Marlowe attacked, and got his 
                 own knife in the eye. A quarrel about 
                 the bill

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity!

<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 Not the billing, the bill!

       WILL steps back, and sinks to his knees. His relief could 
       not be greater.

<b>                           WILL
</b>                     (to the heavens)
                 Oh God, I am free of it!

       WESSEX gets to his feet. TILNEY enters the auditorium 
       from the public entrance.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Close it!

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 My Lord Wessex!

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (foaming)
                 Close it! Take it down stone by stone! 
                 I want it ploughed into the ground, 
                 and sown with quick lime!

       WESSEX storms out past the bewildered TILNEY.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Mr. Tilney, what is this?

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 Sedition and indecency!

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 What?!

<b>                           WEBSTER
</b>                 Master of the Revels, sir, over here, 
                 sir.

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                     (to WEBSTER)
                 Where, boy?

<b>                           WEBSTER
</b>                     (points)
                 I saw her bubbies!

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                     (shocked and gratified)
                 A woman on the stage? A woman?

<b>                           WEBSTER
</b>                 I swear it!

       THE COMPANY of actors are dumbstruck. None more than 
<b>       VIOLA.
</b>
<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 So, Henslowe! I say this theatre is 
                 closed! On the authority of the powers 
                 invested in my by the court--I close 
                 this theatre!

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 Why so?

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                     (triumphantly)
                 For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For 
                 displaying a female on the public 
                 stage!

       TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stage…and seizes 
       SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY 
       pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell 
       of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers. 

       TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER 
       rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly 
       throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair. VIOLA gives a 
       shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via 
       VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which 
       time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her 
       hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender. 
       WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible 
       despair and apology.

<b>                           WEBSTER
</b>                     (pointing at SAM)
                 Not him.
                     (pointing at VIOLA)
                 her.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                 He's a woman!

       By now the scene is playing to a crowded theatre, or so 
       it seems.

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 That's who I meant! This theatre is 
                 closed! Notice will be posted!

       SAM has picked himself up, and his drawers.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (to NED)
                 Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                     (hoping to protect WILL)
                 Nobody knew!

<b>                           WEBSTER
</b>                     (pointing at WILL)
                 He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies!

       Everybody looks at WILL, who stares at VIOLA, helpless.

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 Closed! Closed, mark you, Henslowe!

       TILNEY turns on his heel and leaves in triumph. THE 
       COMPANY is still polaxed.

<b>                           HENSLOWE
</b>                     (in despair)
                 It is over.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted 
                 to be an actor.
                     (she turns to WILL)
                 I am sorry, Will.

       WILL shakes his head. This cannot be the end. VIOLA walks 
       away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her 
       go, watching her silently. As she passes WABASH

<b>                           WABASH
</b>                 Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w-
                 wonderful.

<b>                           VIOLA
</b>                 Thank you.

       As she is leaving, WILL comes to life. He starts off 
       towards her…but his progress is halted by a sock to the 
       jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust. 
       FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper, 
       mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the 
       groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole 
       COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or 
       worse. FENNYMAN looks around.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                 Everything all right?

<b>       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. EVENING.
</b>
       The closure notice is nailed to the door.

<b>       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
       VIOLA, in her nightdress, is reading by candlelight. She 
       is reading her private manuscript of Romeo and Juliet…and 
       rereading. Next to her is a tray of covered dishes. the 
       NURSE enters and looks at her sympathetically. She lifts 
       the tray. She realises it is heavy. She puts it down and 
       raises the covers and sees that VIOLA has eaten nothing. 

       She looks at VIOLA'S tears, but there is nothing to be 
       said.

<b>       INT. TAVERN. DAY.
</b>
       They are all there--the ADMIRAL'S MEN, including WILL and 
       HENSLOWE, drowning their sorrows. Everyone is drunk. 
       FENNYMAN is also there, taking the disaster somewhat 
       selfishly.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                     (muttering)
                 I would have been good…I would have 
                 been great.

       He hands a flask to RALPH who is in a similar mood.

<b>                           RALPH
</b>                 So would I. We both would.

       RALPH contemplates the flask, and, since he's not 
       working, takes a swig. A moment later, he keels over, 
       rigid as a pole. The street door crashes open. BURBAGE 
       enters. Behind him enter a solid wedge of the 
       CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, sober-faced, several with black eyes 
       and bandages round their heads.

<b>                           FENNYMAN
</b>                     (shouts)
                 Lambert!

       LAMBERT, FENNYMAN'S henchman and killer, puts down his 
       tankard and comes forward, casually kicking chairs and 
       tables out of his way.

<b>                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
</b>                 Kill him!

       LAMBERT reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes 
       down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there--a 
       battle-axe. 

       But BURBAGE has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash. 
       BURBAGE draws and the pistol roars, shooting flame, 
       LAMBERT curses, drops the axe, nurses his wounded hand. 
       BURBAGE puts the pistol back into his sash. NED ALLEYN is 
       half-drunk at a table. He staggers to his feet. He faces 
<b>       BURBAGE.
</b>
<b>                           ALLEYN
</b>                 Well, Burbage--you never did know when 
                 your scene was over.

<b>                           BURBAGE
</b>                 That can wait. The Master of the 
                 Revels despises us for vagrants, 
                 tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But 
                 my father, James Burbage, had the 
                 first licence to make a company of 
                 players from Her Majesty, and he drew 
                 from poets the literature of the age. 
                 Their fame will be our fame. So let 
                 them all know, we are men of parts. We 
                 are a brotherhood, and we will be a 
                 profession. Will Shakespeare has a 
                 play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is

</b>
       A strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a 
       paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble 
       pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of 
       wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen 
       flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot 
       runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at 
       the poster. It says

       WILL comes out of the theatre, and passes the poster. He 
       walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him:

       WILL does not turn to look at him.

       WESSEX, dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his 
       negotiations with DE LESSEPS, while LADY DE LESSEPS 
       weeps. DE LESSEPS is signing papers. There is a money

       WILL is running across the grass towards the house. As he 
       crosses the bridge over the moat, a carriage bears down 
       on him, and he has to flatten himself against the wall of 
       the gatehouse as the carriage passes, taking WESSEX and 
       his bride to church. WILL'S face, as he watches the 
       carriage disappear. Distant bells begin to peal

<b>       EXT. CHURCH DOOR. DAY.
</b>
       The bells announce the completion of the marriage--as 
       WESSEX and the new LADY WESSEX leave the church. VIOLA'S 
       veil is flying in the wind, and beneath it we can just 
       see VIOLA'S unhappy face. The DE LESSEPS FAMILY entourage 
       is applauding. WESSEX beams with satisfaction. 

       Suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message--a flyer 
       from the Curtain slaps against WESSEX'S face. He claws at 
       it and tries to throw it away. The wind delivers it to 
       VIOLA'S bosom. She takes it up and reads it. And passes 
       it to the NURSE. 

       WESSEX descends the steps to where the curtained carriage 
       awaits the bride and groom. He gallantly holds the door 
       for VIOLA to enter. She climbs aboard. WESSEX makes to 
       follow her.

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 My lord!

       The NURSE grasps him in a moving embrace, to WESSEX'S 
       discomfort.

<b>                           NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>                 Be good to her, my lord!

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 I will.

       He tries to disengage. She won't have it.

<b>                           NURSE
</b>                 God bless you!

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Thank you. Let go, there's a good 
                 nurse.

       After a couple of further attempts, WESSEX extricates 
       himself.

<b>                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>                 The tide will not wait. Farewell!

       WESSEX pulls aside the curtain and gets in.

       It takes a moment for WESSEX to realise he is alone in

       Hundreds of people are converging on the theatre. Among

       giving last minute instructions to PETER. JAMES and JOHN 
       HEMMINGS are arguing about the timing of their entrance. 
       FENNYMAN in his apothecary's cap is agonising over his

       WABASH seems to be important at the beginning. We have 
       never been told what part he plays. He is still muttering 
       lines and stuttering them.

       VIOLA and the NURSE are arriving, and looking for a seat 
       in the gallery. BURBAGE and his MEN are standing at the 
       back, behind the people seated in the gallery. The first 
       scene of the play is continuing

</b>                 Can we talk?

       They are standing behind the back row of the gallery 
       seats. The spectator in front of them is the NURSE. She 
       turns round and shushes HENSLOWE up.

       from the neighbours. HENSLOWE pulls VIOLA from her seat,

                 not move.

       We cannot tell whether this is the play or their life. 
       The audience, and the rest of the world, might as well 
       not exist. WILL turn from her and begins to descend from

       WILL as "ROMEO" seems unable to speak. Then he says:

</b>                 "…Farewell…"

       All other sounds drain away, and time seems to stop.

       "JULIET" lies "dead." She lies on top of her tomb, "lying 
       in stage," her best dress, her hair done, her hands in 
       prayer at her breast, her eyes closed. "ROMEO" has found 
       her like this.

<b>                           WILL AS ROMEO
</b>                 "Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your

                 now at once run on The dashing rocks 
                 thy seasick weary bark!"

       As WILL embraces her, VIOLA'S eyes flicker open (shielded 
       by WILL from the audience) and the lovers look at each 
       other for a moment as WILL and VIOLA rather than as 
       "ROMEO" and "JULIET." Their eyes are wet with tears.

       worried. But then the audience goes mad with applause.

<b>       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE INNER CURTAIN/STAGE. DAY.

       The inner curtain opens, but WILL and VIOLA, are in a 
       play of their own…embracing and kissing passionately, 
       making their own farewell. HENSLOWE is too stunned and

       The audience roars. WILL, VIOLA, and THE COMPANY come 
       forward to meet the applause. TILNEY and his MEN burst 
       in. TILNEY jumps up onto the stage, where the ADMIRAL'S 
       MEN are taking their bows. TILNEY'S "COPS" ring the 
       stage, facing inwards.

<b>                           TILNEY
</b>                 I'll see you all in the clink! In the 
                 same of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth

       And an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts 
       him.

<b>                           VOICE
</b>                 Mr. Tilney…!

       It is QUEEN ELIZABETH herself, descending now, her hood 
       and cloak thrown back. She is an awesome sight. A shaft 
       of sunlight hits her.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 Have a care with my name, you will 
                 wear it out.

       There is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and 
       actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN 
       ELIZABETH takes the limelight.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
</b>                 The Queen of England does not attend 
                 exhibitions of public lewdness so 
                 something is out of joint. Come here, 
                 Master Kent. Let me look at you.

       VIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she 
       catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests 
       the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
</b>                 Yes, the illusion is remarkable and 
                 your error, Mr. Tilney, easily 
                 forgiven, but I know something of a 
                 woman in a man's profession, yes, by 
                 God, I do know about that. That is 
                 enough from you, Maser Kent. If only 
                 Lord Wessex were here.

<b>                           VOICE
</b>                 He is, Ma'am.

       The voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a 
       figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look 
       inconspicuous.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                     (weakly)

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 There was a wager, I remember…as to 
                 whether a play can show the very truth 
                 and nature of love. I think you lost 
                 it today.
                     (turning to WEBSTER)
                 You are an eager boy. Did you like the 
                 play?

<b>                           WEBSTER
</b>                 I liked it when she stabbed herself, 
                 your Majesty.

       The QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye.

<b>                           QUEEN

                 come to Greenwich, Come as yourself 
                 and we will speak some more. WILL bows 
                 deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The 
                 waves part for her.

       The QUEEN is bowed out through the doors.

<b>       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her 
       carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase 
       as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the 
       following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking 
       place, including some of the actors crowding to see her 
       off. WESSEX bows out of breath.

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Your Majesty!

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so 
                 soon?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Indeed I am a bride short. How is this 
                 to end?

       VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the 
       other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 As stories must when love's 
                 denied--with tears and a journey. Those 
                 whom God has joined in marriage, not 
                 even I can put asunder.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)

                 his wife in the play- house--go make 
                 your farewell and send her out. It's 
                 time to settle accounts.
                     (to WESSEX)
                 How much was the wager?

<b>                           WESSEX
</b>                 Fifty shillings.
                     (the QUEEN gives him a look)
                 Pounds.

<b>                           QUEEN
</b>                 Give it to Master Kent. He will see it 
                 rightfully home. WESSEX gives his 
                 purse to VIOLA.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
</b>                     (to VIOLA)
                 And tell Shakespeare something more 
                 cheerful next time for Twelfth Night.

       The QUEEN proceeds towards her carriage. There is an 
       enormous puddle between her and her carriage. The QUEEN 
       hesitates for a fraction and then marches through the 
       puddle as cloaks descend upon it.

<b>                           QUEEN (CONT'D)

                 My Lady Wessex?

       VIOLA nods, heartbroken too. For a long moment they 
       cannot say anything to each other. The she holds up 
       Wessex's purse.

<b>                           VIOLA
