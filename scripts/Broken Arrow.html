<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          A FIST HITS A FACE
</b>          The fist is in a boxing glove. It belongs to VIC DEAKINS, 38.
          The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They are in...

<b>          INT. GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAY
</b>
          Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are
          lifting weights, shooting baskets.

<b>          IN THE RING
</b>          Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out
          of his head.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          You know what happened there?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Hell, I barely know what day it is.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          I set you up. I fake right, go
          left three times in a row. You
          expect it again, I take the right
          in hard. That's what boxing's all
          about. Make your opponent think
          you're gonna do one thing, then do
          another. Like Ali in Zaire, using
          the rope-a-dope on Foreman.
          (mimes rope-a-dope)
          Everyone thought Ali's arms were
          getting destroyed, when he was
          really just letting Foreman tire
          himself out. Eighth round, Ali
          starts hitting, George's got
          nothing left -- fight's over.

<b>          HALE
</b>          The fact that I can't feel the
          left side of my face -- that's
          okay, right?
          Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly
          launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.

<b>          THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM
</b>          Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught
          off guard. It looks like he might even go down.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           2.
</b>
<b>          HALE
</b>          He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he
          doesn't. He drops his fist.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.

<b>          THE CROWD
</b>          Loves it.

<b>          HALE AND DEAKINS
</b>          Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Don't watch my hands -- watch my
          shoulders. That's where the punch
          starts. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.

<b>          THE SPECTATORS
</b>          Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.

<b>          HALE AND DEAKINS
</b>
<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          You were looking at my hands.
          Let's try it again. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Come on. Focus. Ready?

<b>          (PUNCH)
</b>          My shoulders. Ready?
          Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It
          connects.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          He's in silhouette, the lights above him.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.

<b>           3.
</b>
<b>          HALE AND DEAKINS
</b>          Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores
          Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out
          of the ring between the ropes.
          Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his
          feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.

<b>          INT. SHOWERS
</b>
          Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.

<b>          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,
          getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is
          smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting
          down across the room from high windows.

<b>          HALE'S LOCKER
</b>          Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures
          of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's
          rendition of the Aurora, etc.

<b>          DEAKINS' LOCKER
</b>          On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his
          locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Here.

<b>          HALE'S HAND
</b>          Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          I can't take that.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Oh, shut up.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Really. I feel bad. How many times
          have we fought and how many times
          have you won?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Jerk.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Well, if you insist.
          Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.

<b>

<b>           4.
</b>
<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          You know why I beat you?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Because you've been boxing for
          twenty years and you're much
          better at it than I am?

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          You don't want it enough. You had
          me today. I was back on my heels.
          But you didn't close the door.

<b>          HALE
</b>          We were just sparring.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Life isn't sparring, Hale.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I think I saw that on a T-shirt.
          Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Here.

<b>          HALE
</b>          No, that's yours.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          If you weren't giving it
          everything you've got, then I
          don't want it.

<b>          HALE
</b>          No, I mean -- that's yours,
          literally. I took it out of your
          wallet when you were in the shower.
          Deakins laughs, puts the money away.

<b>          EXT. WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE - DUSK

          Planes taxiing, vehicles moving.

<b>          INT. WHITEMAN MISSION BRIEFING ROOM
</b>
          Deakins and Hale enter to find GENERAL BOONE, 50s.

<b>          DEAKINS/HALE
</b>          General.

<b>

<b>

</b>          Gentlemen.
          (nods at NO SMOKING

<b>          SIGN)
</b>          Deak?

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Sorry.
          (puts out cigarette)
          What's the mission, General?

<b>          BOONE
</b>          Simulate a border penetration. Hug
          the ground. Scare some cows. See
          if anyone can spot you.

<b>          HALE
</b>          The usual ...?

<b>          BOONE
</b>          No, actually, it's a little
          unusual. You're carrying a couple
          of nukes tonight, fellas.
          (off their looks)
          Palmdale's afraid low-level gamma
          and x-ray diffusion might screw up
          the peripherals. They asked us to
          send a couple on a run, see if
          anything glows.

<b>          HALE
</b>          '61s?

<b>          BOONE
</b>          (shakes head)
          Big ones. '83s.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Ooh. Crowpleasers.

<b>          INT. HANGAR
</b>
          A BOMB TRUCK carrying two B-83 nuclear weapons drives under the
          wing of a big, black plane, toward the open bomb bays. GROUND
          CREWMEN are hurrying about.

<b>          HALE AND DEAKINS
</b>          Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale
          and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the
          airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear.

<b>          INT. COCKPIT
</b>
          Hale and Deakins climb into a very strange cockpit. There are
          two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           6.
</b>          But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels,
          there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale
          gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review
          information on their screens, flip switches.

<b>          INTERCUT WITH BOMBS
</b>          Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into
          place in the rotary bomb racks...

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          (into helmet mike)
          Ready for rollout.

<b>          INT./EXT. HANGAR
</b>
          Alarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar
          doors open revealing...

<b>          THE GHOST
</b>          An enormous black flying wing.

<b>          INT. COCKPIT
</b>
          Deakins looks at maps on his computer screens. Hale looks over,
          sees the map of Utah.

<b>          HALE
</b>          You know, these exercises are
          fantastic. I mean, when that day
          comes and we finally go to war
          against Utah, we are really going
          to kick ass.

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT
</b>
          Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an
          escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the
          campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a
          painting in progress.

<b>          A PARK RANGER TRUCK
</b>          Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...

<b>          A RANGER
</b>          We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,
          walks over and taps on the tent.

<b>          RANGER
</b>          Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to
          somebody about this fire.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           7.
</b>          We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.

<b>          JIM (O.S.)
</b>          Wha--? Oh, hell.

<b>          WANDA (O.S.)
</b>          I'll talk to him, Jim.

<b>          JIM (O.S.)
</b>          Wanda, you stay put.
          Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.

<b>          JIM
</b>          I know -- no wood fires in the
          Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a
          cold and I wanted her to stay warm.

<b>          RANGER
</b>          Sir, you see any other hikers,
          campers anywhere around here?

<b>          JIM
</b>          Not this time of year. What's the
          fine for something like this?

<b>          RANGER
</b>          Your life.
          Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,
          who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the
          wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him
          BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.

<b>          BAKER
</b>          Done.

<b>          HEADLIGHTS
</b>          Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of
          them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK,
          a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to
          be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is...

<b>          MR. PRITCHETT
</b>          A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He
          looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.

<b>          PRITCHETT
</b>          (to Baker, re: Jim in

<b>          FIRE)
</b>          Jesus. Do you think maybe you
          could get him out of the fire?
          Unless you like that smell.

</b>
          Deakins and Hale check their screens.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          (thinks of something)
          Weren't you going to call Taylor
          today about the Aurora Project?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Yeah. Turns out he wants people
          with more fighter hours.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          What'd you say?

<b>          HALE
</b>          What could I say?

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Jesus. You are such a pussy. You
          never fight for anything.
          Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Yeah, well you know what your
          problem is?

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Because I said what your problem
          is, you're gonna--?

<b>          HALE
</b>          You fight too much.
          (Deakins look at him)
          Right? You said it yourself --
          you should be at least Wing
          Commander by now. Maybe you would
          be if you didn't insist on telling
          people what they're doing wrong
          all the time.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          I'm usually right though, aren't I?
          Hale shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.

</b>          The bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet, punching
          a hole in the window by his head.

<b>          DEAKINS AND HALE
</b>          Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes
          up, sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane, into the
          walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.

</b>          Tears through Hale's harness, blowing apart a shoulder strap.

<b>          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM
</b>

<b>          CU COMPUTER SCREEN
</b>          Various views of a B-83 nuclear weapon. Creeley is briefing
          Baird on the nukes.

<b>          BAIRD
</b>          They dropped from a plane but they
          didn't go off...?

<b>          CREELEY
</b>          They have to be armed to detonate.

<b>          BAIRD
</b>          Then they're destroyed?

<b>          CREELEY
</b>          (shakes head)
          They're designed to survive
          crashes intact. They can lie in
          a pool of burning jet fuel for
          five hours without any problem.

<b>          BAIRD
</b>          How did this happen?

<b>          CREELEY
</b>          In his last transmission, Colonel
          Deakins said Major Hale lost
          control. He probably hit weapons
          release by accident. Believe me,
          when a plane's auguring in, you
          start pushing every button you can.
          Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head.

<b>          BAIRD
</b>          Hell, we should take the cost of
          the plane out of major Hale's
          salary. Although I guess at two
          billion dollars a pop, that could
          take a while.

          Hale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's
          the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure
          reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and...

<b>          HALE
</b>          Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to
          punch. He hesitates when he sees it's...

<b>          TERRY
</b>          She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun.
          Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending
          her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun.
          Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.

<b>          HIS POV
</b>          Jarring, racing over rock and then...

<b>          HALE
</b>          Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.

<b>          HALE'S POV
</b>          He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop.

<b>          TERRY (O.S.)
</b>          That would be the wrong way.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out.

</b>          Look, I --

<b>          TERRY
</b>          (not interested)

          Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I'm going to tell you something I
          can't tell you.
          Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching
          him off.

<b>          HALE
</b>          There were nuclear weapons on that
          plane. The guy I was flying with
          is trying to steal them.
          Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I only ran because you punched me.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          What, we're ten years old now?
          "You started it. No you started

</b>          He has men on the ground. I --

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Save it. My dog's waiting for his
          breakfast.
          Terry starts to push Hale along again and...

<b>          HALE
</b>          Jumps up and through the handcuffs.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Reaches for her revolver, but...

<b>          HALE
</b>          Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before...

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.

<b>          HALE
</b>          This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've
          got a gun.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Yeah, well, I never keep my gun
          loaded.
          Terry taps her belt.

</b>          A line of bullets.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on
          his finger. Just as Terry takes it...

<b>          HALE
</b>          Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out
          from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still holding her
          knife hand, putting the knife to her throat.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I'm telling you the truth.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          This is a good way to convince me.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I could kill you now. Right?
          Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared.
          Hale lets go of Terry's hand holding the knife.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I need your help.
          Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the
          knife. She exhales, then sticks the knife in the dirt.

          (off her look)
          That's what I'd do.

</b>          I don't have any choice. The

</b>          I do have one thing going for me.

</b>          What's that?
          Hale sticks...

</b>          Under a rock.

</b>          The last thing in the world he

<b>          NOVACEK AND LETT

</b>          It's an Air Force training

</b>          Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly
          with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett.

</b>          Ah, but we always planned on the

          of everything.
          Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear.

          A Ranger called her base, said she

</b>          What happened?
          Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40
          static. Deakins pulls the shaver away, nods to Kelly.

<b>          KELLY
</b>          It's the nuke, sir! It's open!
          Wide open! Oh, God, what am I
          going to do?!
          Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He
          reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK switch,
          then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the
          helicopter.

</b>          (to Deakins)
          I hope you've got another surprise
          up your sleeve. If I'm not
          mistaken, there are two attack
          helicopters headed this way.

</b>          Not any longer.
          They look at him; he taps his radio headgear.

<b>          JOHNSON
</b>          They've just been recalled.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think
          they've got an exposed core.
          They'll want to get a satellite to
          take a look, but it'll take ninety
          minutes minimum to shift the
          orbit. Until then? Well, people
          get a little weird when it comes
          to radiation. No one'll have the
          balls to come near here unless
          it's NEST -- the Nuclear Emergency
          Search Teams --and it'll take the
          nearest team at least two hours to
          get out here, and we only need an

          Hale and Terry are riding in Terry's truck. Terry drives. Hale
          is wearing work clothes. After some silence...

<b>          HALE
</b>          What's your dog's name?

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Bear. I was going to call him
          Death, so I could say things like,

          Before Hale can answer...

<b>          THE SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER
</b>          Rises up in front of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a
          button and machine guns on the sides open up.

<b>          TERRY AND HALE
</b>          Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...

<b>          THE TRUCK
</b>          is riddled with bullets and explodes.

<b>          TERRY AND HALE
</b>          Sprint up the trail.

</b>          We've gotta hide!

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Follow me!
          Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top
          and is stunned. Terry runs out onto an open expanse -- no cover.

</b>          Hide where?

</b>          I'm a Ranger. I've been over

          Not looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head
          and drops like a rock.

<b>          IN THE HELICOPTER
</b>          Novacek can't see his prey. He gets an idea and reaches back.

<b>          TERRY AND HALE

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Please don't tell anyone I did
          that.

<b>          IN THE HELICOPTER
</b>          Novacek has a box of grenades beside him. He pulls the pin on
          a grenade and drops it.

<b>          TERRY AND HALE
</b>          Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade
          goes off. They run.

<b>          THE HELICOPTER
</b>          Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! -- a grenade goes off in
          front of them. They run back. They're cornered. Hale looks
          around, looks up.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Can you climb up?

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Yeah ...?

</b>          Who sees her.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Pull herself up, stands, hands up.

<b>          THE HELICOPTER
</b>          Novacek swivels the helicopter around.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          This has nothing to do with me.

<b>          NOVACEK
</b>          Tell me where he is!

<b>          HALE
</b>          Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the
          helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out where to shoot.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat
          back a foot ... Puts him right
          about ... here.
          Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then
          takes a breath and starts shooting.

<b>          IN THE HELICOPTER
</b>          The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps,
          pushing the joystick to one side.

<b>          THE HELICOPTER
</b>          Starts to lean over sideways.

<b>          HALE

</b>          Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The
          blades stop dead. But the torque of the motor brings...

</b>          Up and over, in a high arc.

</b>          Looks up.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Mr. Pritchett, I understand your
          concerns. You and your associates
          gave me a lot of money to mount
          this operation. But they're
          getting ten times that back if we
          succeed.

<b>          PRITCHETT
</b>          If we succeed?

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          All I can do is my part. We've

          can't guarantee that the assholes
          in Washington won't do something
          stupid like not pay.

<b>          PRITCHETT
</b>          What if they don't?

<b>          DEAKINS

<b>          THEIR POV
</b>          The two Humvees make their way along the trail.

<b>          HALE
</b>          See the one in front? It just has
          a driver? They wanted to keep the
          weight down. It has the nukes.
          Hale takes Terry's gun from her.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          You gonna shoot out the tires?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Humvees can reseal and inflate
          with the flick of a switch. That's
          why Deak chose 'em.
          Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do?

<b>          HALE
</b>          I'm gonna steal it.
          (checks gun)
          You get to a phone and call
          McMurran.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          The nearest phone is a two-hour
          walk.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Then you better start walking.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Look, I know my way around here.
          You're gonna need me.

<b>          HALE
</b>          (very serious)
          I appreciate what you've done so
          far. But now it gets hairy. Go
          to the phone.
          He scrambles off over the rock.

<b>          THE HUMVEES
</b>          Come around a corner. The trail hugs the face of a ten-foot-
          high cliff. Suddenly, from off the cliff...

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at
          Terry, angry. But before he can say anything...

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>           43.
</b>
<b>          IN THE HUMVEE
</b>          Baker swerves, trying to throw them off. He pulls out a pistol,
          shoots up through the ceiling.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his
          hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends...

<b>          HALE
</b>          Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.

<b>          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
</b>          Deakins points at Hale, getting to his feet.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Run him down.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Looks back, sees Hale's predicament.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Here!
          She slides the pistol along the truck roof.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Grabs the gun out of the air as...

<b>          BAKER
</b>          Slams on the brakes.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up,
          turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the tailgate
          facing backwards and fires into Deakins' windshield.

<b>          DEAKINS AND KELLY
</b>          Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins
          doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>           44.
</b>
<b>          IN THE LEAD HUMVEE
</b>          Baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at Terry and starts
          to pull the trigger when he stops, feeling a gun against the
          back of his head.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Gimme the gun and get out.

<b>          BAKER
</b>
<b>          (SMIRKING)
</b>          I don't know. I think we got
          ourselves a little stand-off.

<b>          HALE
</b>          No, we don't.
          Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as...

<b>          HALE
</b>          Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.

<b>          BAKER
</b>          Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in front of...

<b>          DEAKINS' HUMVEE
</b>          And is run over.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.

<b>          HALE
</b>          You drive!

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams
          Baker's gun into her belt.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I'd yell at you for coming after
          me, but you did just save my life.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           45.
</b>          There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He
          finds what he is looking for -- a jerry can of gasoline and an
          emergency tool box.

<b>          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
</b>
<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          What're you doing, Hale?

<b>          IN HALE AND TERRY'S HUMVEE
</b>          Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape
          off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...

<b>          A FLARE
</b>          Out of the tool kit.

<b>          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
</b>
<b>          KELLY
</b>          Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd
          show us.

<b>          BETWEEN THE HUMVEES
</b>          Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee.

<b>          THE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE
</b>          Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the
          side of the plastic can.

<b>          ECU TIP OF FLARE
</b>          As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and...

<b>          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
</b>
<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Stop!
          But it's too late and...

<b>          THE JERRY CAN
</b>          Explodes.

<b>          THE SECOND HUMVEE
</b>          Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and
          his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and Pritchett run for cover.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>           46.
</b>
<b>          IN HALE AND TERRYS HUMVEE
</b>          Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him,
          genuinely impressed.

<b>          HALE
</b>          We need somewhere to hide.

<b>          TERRY
</b>
<b>          (THINKS)
</b>          I know a place.

<b>          EXT. 4WD TRAIL
</b>
          Deakins keeps spraying the burning Humvee with foam.

<b>          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE
</b>
          Terry and Hale have taken the Humvee to the parking area in
          front of an abandoned mine. The winch on the Humvee strains.
          The cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal
          doors. The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          It was a copper mine, barely
          squeaking along for years. They
          shut it-down a few months ago when
          they hit an underground river.
          The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip
          loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors.
          He motions for Terry to drive it in.

<b>          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE
</b>
          Terry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses
          a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A
          gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on.
          Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire-
          mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the
          Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up.

<b>          HALE
</b>          They hardwired in their frequency.
          We can't call out.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          What are we gonna do?
          Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I'm gonna take away Deakins'
          reason for being here.
          Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a
          panel on the side of one of the B-83s.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>           47.
</b>
<b>          INSIDE PANEL
</b>          There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the
          current time. The keys are oversized and brightly colored.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?

<b>          HALE
</b>          They're designed to be used by
          guys wearing gloves in Alaska.
          He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up.

<b>          HALE
</b>          These nukes have security codes.
          If you enter the wrong code three
          times, the nuke goes dead -- all
          the circuitry shorts out and shuts
          down. Kind of like the security
          systems with car radios.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          And people say the public doesn't
          benefit from defense spending.

<b>          HALE
</b>
<b>          (GRINS)
</b>          Hand me the radio.
          Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something.

<b>          A PLASTIC NAME TAG
</b>          Sticking out from under one of the nukes.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Pulls it out, looks at it.

<b>          ECU NAMETAG
</b>          It's from "St. Judes Hospital, Radiology Department."

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Where's St. Judes Hospital?

<b>          INT. 4WD TRAIL -- DEAKINS' HUMVEE
</b>
          The fire is out. The radio crackles.

<b>          HALE (V.0.)
</b>          Deak -- you there?

</b>          Deakins and Kelly look at each other.

<b>          HALE (V.O.)
</b>          Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We're
          starting a new round. You took
          the first couple, but I've got you
          on the ropes now, you son of bitch.
          Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio mike.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Hey, there. What was that last
          part? There was some static.
          (clicks off mike; to

<b>          JOHNSON)
</b>          Find them.
          (to Pritchett and

<b>          KELLY)
</b>          Let's go!
          Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one
          Rhodes used. Kelly and Pritchett get back in the vehicle.

<b>          CROSSCUT BETWEEN HALE AND DEAKINS
</b>          Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I know you're stalling while you
          try to find the nukes with your
          scanner, but you're gonna be too
          late. Hear that?
          Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I'm entering the wrong code, you
          bastard. A couple more times and
          these are gonna be useless to you.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          You really got me there. I sure
          didn't think of that.
          Hale slows down -- something's wrong -- Deakins doesn't cars.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          All that time we spent in the
          cockpit together and you think I'm
          stupid? I got some new boards and
          circuits from a friend at Pantex.
          But nice try.
          Hale curses to himself. Terry looks at him. He shakes his head
          they're in trouble.

<b>

<b>

</b>
<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          You know, Hale, I thought of
          asking you to join me on this. You
          wanna know why I didn't?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Because I would've said no?

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          I would've just killed you if you
          said no. I was more afraid you'd
          say yes. Because I knew I
          couldn't count on you. You can
          pretend you've got guts, but when
          and if it comes down to it, you're
          gonna run off crying like a little
          girl.

<b>          HALE
</b>          You better hope that's true, Doak.
          Because I've got the nukes, and
          there's nothing to stop me from
          entering the right code, if you
          know what I mean.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          (flash of worry)
          You wouldn't do that.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Nah. You're right. I wouldn't
          have the guts.
          END SPLIT-SCREEN. Hale drops the mike; looks at the elevator.

<b>          HALE
</b>          How deep is this mine?

<b>          TERRY
</b>          I don't know. A couple thousand
          feet.

<b>          HALE
</b>          That's deep enough.
          Hale opens the elevator gate.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          For what?

<b>          HALE
</b>          A nuclear explosion.

</b>          He's got a scanner. He'd find
          them.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          You're talking about setting off

<b>          HALE
</b>          They set them off underground in

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Tell it to the two-headed cows.
          Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can
          barely move the thing. He turns to Terry.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          No! I am not helping you set off
          a nuclear weapon.

<b>          HALE

          serious.

<b>          HALE

<b>          HALE
</b>          When we get to the bottom we'll
          have to get away from this shaft.

<b>          EXT. MINE - BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT
</b>
          The elevator comes down. Hale slides open the gate. He and
          Terry drag the nukes out.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          We'll each drag one down a tunnel?

<b>          HALE

          Baird, the Chairman and the others are watching large TV
          monitors. Creeley walks them through what they're looking at.

<b>          ON THE MONITORS
</b>          A wide-view, bird's-eye, thermal image of rocky terrain.

<b>          CREELEY
</b>          This is the KH-12 satellite's
          infrared view of the area. An
          exposed nuclear core would be
          relatively hot -- it'd show as a
          circle of bright white. As you
          can see, there's nothing. The
          only heat signatures we found were
          these.
          The image changes. There are four blotches, glowing a dull red.

<b>          BAIRD
</b>          What's --?

<b>          CREELEY
</b>          We think it's Colonel Rhodes and
          his men. Their bodies.
          A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman reaches for
          a phone.

          Wilkins is on the phone. Giles looks at him.

<b>          INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL
</b>
          Hale and Terry have stopped at the end of a tunnel. Hale has
          opened the guts of the nuke. He's pulling out a chip.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          How do you know how to do this?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Pilots who fly with nuclear

          He stands, looks around. He sees...

<b>          EYEBOLTS
</b>          Screwed into the cross beaus on the ceiling.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I'm gonna need your belt and one
          of your socks.

<b>          INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          The elevator descends into view. Deakins, Kelly and Johnson get
          out. They see the other nuke lying there.

<b>          KELLY
</b>          Send it up?

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          (shakes head)

<b>          INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL
</b>
          In one hand Hale holds Terry's sock, filled with sand. His
          other hand grips the eyebolt. Terry is giving Hale a log up,
          straining under the weight.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Take your time. Really.
          Hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He
          tightens a belt around the open end of the sock.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Okay.
          Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a big rock and loops the
          free end of the belt around it. Then he picks up a smaller rock.

<b>          CLOSE ON NUCLEAR WEAPON
</b>          One chip has been pulled out of a circuit board. Hale very
          gingerly lays the small rock on top of the chip.

<b>          HALE
</b>          We make a small hole in the sock,
          and when enough sand drains out --
          and we're hopefully in New
          Mexico -- the sock is pulled
          through the eyebolt, the rock
          drops...
          (re: smaller rock)
          ... hitting the rock on this chip,
          closing the firing circuit and
          that's it.
          Hale finishes putting the small rock in position. He stands.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          How much time are we going to have?

<b>          HALE
</b>          I don't know precisely. This
          isn't a Swiss sock. Ten minutes,
          maybe --
          Hale is cut off by...

<b>          BULLETS
</b>          Flying in, ricocheting off the rock walls, fired by...

</b>          Thirty yards down the tunnel.

</b>
<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.

<b>          THE SOCK
</b>          One of Johnson's bullets cuts through it.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.

<b>          HIS POV
</b>          Sand is draining out of the sock very fast.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of
          bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Come on!

<b>          HALE
</b>          The sock --
          More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage.
          Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight.

<b>          JOHNSON
</b>          Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for
          the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off.

<b>          THE SOCK
</b>          The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt.

<b>          THE ROCK
</b>          Drops fast toward the nuke.

<b>          A HAND
</b>          Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to...

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He
          pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it.

<b>          JOHNSON)
</b>          You two get this one set. I'll
          take the other one up.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Running along a tunnel.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          What do we do?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Beat 'em back to the elevator.
          Stop 'em from getting out.
          Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by...

<b>          A FLURRY OF BULLETS
</b>          Fired by...

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          With his Uzi.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all
          around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the
          lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Slows down.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          The bit with the sock was good.
          I like it. Still, I'm gonna use
          the the Field Expedient Tactical
          Timer. It's a little more precise.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          See, Hale -- you aren't the only
          one who's thought of setting off
          a nuke in this mine.

<b>          BY THE NUKE
</b>          Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a

<b>          IN THE TUNNELS
</b>          Deakins pulls out a fresh clip.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          I need a demonstration. Otherwise,
          some swinging dick in Washington
          is going to say I don't have the
          balls or the ability to set off a

          these puppies I'm ready, willing
          and able. Hell, I'm eager.
          Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along
          the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and
          electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light,
          showing...

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale
          and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Take cover. It's a stand-off.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Well, Hale, I better be going.
          Look at it this way, partner. If
          you wanted to get closer to God,
          you are about to get your wish.
          Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off.

<b>          HALE
</b>          You're gonna ransom Salt Lake
          City, aren't you?
          The footsteps stop.

<b>          HALE
</b>          That's where St. Judes Hospital

          near the radiology department so
          they won't show up an any

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          I'm impressed.

<b>          HALE
</b>          How much are you gonna ask for?

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Enough. I've got a broker in
          Stockholm. Monday morning he's
          going to buy me five percent of
          Volvo. For the rest of my days
          I'm going to live off the

          I'm helping to build the safest

<b>          HALE
</b>          So that's it? You're just doing
          'this for the money? I'm kind of
          disappointed.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Why would you do it, Hale?

<b>          HALE
</b>          That's the thing -- I wouldn't.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          If you were me.

<b>          HALE
</b>          If I were you...?
          (thinks, starts in)

          It wipes out anything electronic
          for miles. That"s another reason

          also shut down all radio

          worked as a river guide and
          eventually stayed year-round. When

          one night I was coming home from

          yelling and I see Tommy heading
          for his car, so I tossed a bag of
          groceries at him at thirty miles
          an hour. A frozen chicken in the
          bag hit him in the forehead and he
          dropped like a rock. Next thing

</b>          Because I like him. He doesn't
          ask a lot of annoying questions.
          All right?
          A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under
          water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces to watch the
          raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.

<b>          ON THE RAFT - MOVING
</b>          The nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft. Sheppard
          pilots the raft. Deakins looks around, sees what he wants.

<b>          A TARP
</b>          Is lying on the deck of the raft along one side, all bunched up.
          It'd be the kind of thing you'd hide under.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Grabs the tarp and pulls.

<b>          UNDER THE TARP
</b>          There's no one there.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...

<b>          A LONG CRATE MARKED "LIFE JACKETS"
</b>          Strapped to one of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth
          is sticking out from inside the crate -- like the corner of a
          shirt. It's quickly pulled out of sight from within.

<b>          BACK ON THE RIVERBANK
</b>          Hale climbs out of the water and looks around, not knowing quite
          what to do.

<b>          EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT
</b>
          The zodiac boat is on the shore. Sheppard and four man -- call
          them the GUNMEN -- are hauling the nuke to the truck. Deakins
          walks with another man -- MAX, 50s. Max checks his watch.

</b>          I wish I could see their faces.

<b>          INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM

          Baird, the Chairman, Creeley and the others are all staring
          slack-jawed at a TV screen.

</b>          Camcorder shot of Deakins against a black backdrop.

          The depositing instructions are in
          the envelope that came with this
          tape. This deadline is not
          negotiable, and there is no grace
          period. The device is on a timer.
          Shortly after you receive this,
          the timer will be activated. At

          If you have not complied --
          The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear
          destruction -- buildings being knocked sideways, mushroom
          clouds, shockwaves, fires.

          Hale runs along the shoreline, headed for...

<b>          A MARINA
</b>          Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign
          with a picture of a phone on it.

          The back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck
          starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right
          behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds

          Major Hale is alive. According to
          him, Colonel Deakins is headed for
          Salt Lake City.

<b>          EXT. LAKE POWELL - MARINA
</b>
          Army helicopters are landing near the marina. Two are already
          down. One has TROOPS standing outside of it.

<b>          HALE, WILKINS AND GILES
</b>          Are walking toward the second helicopter.

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          We found the raft on the other
          side of the lake. Tracks from a
          heavy truck ran out when they hit
          the paved road.

<b>          HALE
</b>          If we get a rad scanner we can
          track them.
          A brief look between Wilkins and Giles.

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          Actually, Major, we're going back
          to McMurran.

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          No debate, Major. I was given
          orders. Now, you can come with us,
          or you can go with them.
          Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing
          in front of it are MPs. Hale looks at Wilkins, astounded.

<b>          EXT./INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT
</b>
          Wilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back.
          All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Deakins thinks I'm dead. He
          thinks it's over. You've got to
          let me go after him. I can help.
          I know how his mind works.

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          Major, I know this is personal for
          you, but I think we can handle it.
          We're putting a wall of men and
          machines around Salt Lake City as
          we speak. That truck is not
          getting through.

          The nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock, straps running off to
          D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up an electronic timer.

<b>          HALE

</b>          What about her?

<b>          HALE
</b>          When you find that truck, you'll
          hit it hard. Chances are she'll
          be killed in the crossfire.
          "Regrettable but unavoidable."

</b>          Giles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Look, she's not supposed to be
          there. She should be checking
          camping permits, finding lost
          kids. She...

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          She saved my life.
          Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but...

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          We were ordered to take you back
          to McMurran. You understand what
          orders are, don't you, Major?
          Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing
          what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's
          weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck.

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          Major, put that away or say
          goodbye to your career and hello
          to twenty years in Leavenworth.

<b>          HALE
</b>          If that's what it takes.

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          You'll have to shoot me.
          Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that. He lowers the
          gun, sits back.
          Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale
          doesn't understand, so Giles grabs Hale's gunhand and puts the
          gun up to his head.

<b>          GILES
</b>          Colonel! How about this?
          Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head.

<b>          HALE
</b>          (bad acting)
          I swear to God I'll shoot.
          Wilkins grins.

          Max finishes hooking up the timer. He looks at Deakins.

</b>
          Hale is looking back and forth between what he sees out the
          window and the map on his lap.

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          I don't know what you're looking
          for, Major. Every road between
          here and salt Lake has already
          been sealed.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Deak would know that. Maybe he's
          not on the road.
          Wilkins doesn't understand.

<b>          HALE
</b>          They were using maps like these to
          set up the roadblocks?

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          Yes...?

<b>          HALE
</b>          Then that's the answer.
          Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at...

<b>          TRAIN TRACKS
</b>          On the ground. Old ones, half-covered by weeds.

<b>          HALE
</b>          It's an old spur. Probably hasn't
          been used in twenty years. Nobody
          bothered to put it on the new maps.

<b>          WILKINS
</b>          What are you --?

<b>          HALE
</b>          The nuke isn't in a truck,
          Colonel. It's on a train.

          Giles nods. Hale is thinking. Wilkins starts to tell the pilot.

<b>          HALE
</b>          No. Go south.

<b>          HALE

          where he was going.

          thing goes off, a half a million
          people are going to be vaporized.
          I don't want that on my

          arm the nuke.

          Terry is shaking, tears in her eyes, as she slowly-enters the

</b>          Terry has visions of RETIREES in Vegas, watering potted plants
          outside their motor home, of TEENAGERS ragging on each other as

          The images of the retirees, the teenagers and the children each
          bleach out to white, fast, as if hit by a nuclear blast.

          checks his watch.

          Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and
          hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops
          straight back.

          Max goes for his gun.

</b>          Grabs onto something. It's the wrench.

<b>          TERRY AND MAX
</b>          As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It
          hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a rock.

</b>          Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as...

          coils up the winch cable, slings it over his shoulder and heads
          for the nuke boxcar and his old friend Deakins. He picks up...

          Wilkins and the pilot stand outside their disabled helicopter.
          The train is way off in the distance. They hear honking and
          turn to see...

<b>          A PICKUP TRUCK
</b>          Tearing toward then along a dirt road, horn honking.

          Terry comes into the driver's compartment. She tugs at the

          spots a cigarette lighter.

<b>          INT. BOXCAR

          Deakins and the one remaining GUNMAN hear the helicopter. They
          start toward the ladder to the roof hatch when they hear
          footsteps on the roof of the car. Deakins gestures to the
          gunman. He raises his gun, trying to figure out where to shoot.
          Then they hear someone tugging at the hatch handle. The gunman
          opens fire on the hatch.

<b>          EXT. ON TOP OF BOXCAR

          The gunman hears a sound, starts to turn, just as...

</b>          Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun.

<b>          THE GUNMAN
</b>          Is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat
          wall of the boxcar and out of the train.

<b>          TERRY'S POV
</b>          The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat
          from the flaming Toyotas.

<b>          INT. BOXCAR
</b>
          Hale and Deakins circle each other.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Modern boxing is a pussy sport.
          They want to make it about scoring
          points. It's not about scoring
          points! It's about this!

<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           94.
</b>          Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the
          chin. Hale is jarred. Blood runs from his mouth.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In
          the old fights, there'd be so much
          blood, guys would slip and fall.
          Let's see if we can't get a little
          more of that red goo out of you.
          Ready?
          Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but
          is sent back.

<b>          EXT. TRAIN
</b>

<b>          CU TRAIN AXLE
</b>          The axle is bending, grinding, groaning.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the
          axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears
          a horn honking. She turns.

<b>          INT. BOXCAR
</b>

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Used to be, every fight was to a
          knockout. You know what happens
          when you get knocked out? It's
          your brain slapping against the
          inside of your skull. Here. I'll
          let you see what it's like. Ready?
          Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins
          swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets
          Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing
          prone, seeing stars.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above
          him. And then...

<b>          EXT. THE TRAIN AXLE
</b>
          Snaps and...

<b>          THE TRAIN
</b>          Jumps the tracks.

<b>          INT. BOXCAR
</b>
          Hale is thrown off his feet.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           95.
</b>
<b>          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
</b>          Swings wildly in the hammock webbing.

<b>          THE STRAPS
</b>          Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap.

<b>          EXT. TRAIN
</b>
          The front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short,
          steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal.

<b>          FLAMING TOYOTAS
</b>          Fly, tumble, explode.

<b>          INT. BOXCAR
</b>
          Hale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts
          dropping below him as...

<b>          EXT. THE TRAIN
</b>

<b>          THE NUKE BOXCAR
</b>          Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops.

<b>          THE TRAIN
</b>          The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas.

<b>          INT. BOXCAR
</b>
          Flickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the
          slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees...

<b>          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
</b>          It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in
          mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only
          things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to
          the bottom of the car.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the
          nuke, not moving.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Looks around for something. He sees it --

<b>          DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE
</b>          On the floor.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           96.
</b>
<b>          DEAKINS' EYES
</b>          Flicker open. He sees...

<b>          A PISTOL
</b>          Lying a few feet away.

<b>          HALE
</b>
<b>          DEAKINS (O.S.)
</b>          You have to push amber, then red.
          You might have time to push amber.
          You won't get to red.
          Hale turns to see...

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Pointing a gun at him.

<b>          HALE
</b>          The nuke is armed, Deak. If it
          falls, the impact trigger will set
          it off.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          I know.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Half a million people will die.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          (thinks, shrugs)
          Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.

<b>          ONE OF THE STRAPS
</b>          Holding the nuke tears through. One strap left.

<b>          HALE
</b>          His finger hovers over the amber button.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Do it and I shoot.
          Hale looks at Deakins.

<b>          HALE
</b>          I guess you really don't know me
          that well after all.
          Hale presses the amber button.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           97.
</b>
<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Shoots.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.

<b>          THE REMOTE
</b>          Falls from his hand.

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...

<b>          THE LAST STRAP
</b>          Rips through and...

<b>          THE NUKE
</b>          Drops toward him, point first.

<b>          HALE'S BLOODY HAND
</b>          Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.

<b>          ECU NUKE TIMER
</b>          Mid-air, dropping, the clock and display go blank as...

<b>          DEAKINS
</b>          His eyes fill with true terror as...

<b>          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
</b>          Punches into Deakins, point first, crushing him.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down,
          opens Deakins' pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar bill.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Ready.
          He heads out of the boxcar.

<b>          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS
</b>
          Hale climbs out of the boxcar and starts running through the
          train wreckage and burning cars, looking for Terry.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>           98.
</b>
<b>          A TV NEWSVAN
</b>          Pulls up and a REPORTER and CAMERAMAN jump out.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Keeps running through the wreckage. He stops, unable to breathe
          when he sees...

<b>          A FOOT
</b>          In a boot, sticking out from under a burning Toyota.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Runs to the car, pulls at the foot, tries to push the car off
          the body underneath. O.S. another vehicle drives up.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Come on! Oh, God. Oh, no.
          Hale is pulling hard on the foot when...

<b>          TERRY (O.S.)
</b>          The Air Force pays you so little
          you have to steal shoes off dead
          people?
          Hale turns to see...

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Walkins over from the Rancher's pickup truck.

<b>          WILKINS AND GILES
</b>          Are behind her, grinning.

<b>          HALE AND TERRY
</b>          Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's
          hair, start wiping blood off each other's faces, start kissing,
          only to be interrupted by...

<b>          THE TV REPORTER AND CAMERMAN
</b>
<b>          REPORTER
</b>          What happened here?
          Hale and Wilkins and Giles share a look.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Uh...
          (looks at flaming

<b>          TOYOTAS)
</b>          ... somebody was trying to steal
          some Toyotas.
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           99.
</b>          The reporter asks more questions. Hale and Terry walk off, arms
          around each other. As they go, Hale sticks out his hand to
          Terry.

<b>          HALE
</b>          Rawley Hale.

<b>          TERRY
</b>          Terry Carmichael.
          They shake hands and walk on as we...

<b>          FADE TO BLACK
</b>


<b>          THE END
