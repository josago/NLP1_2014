</b>              FADE IN on MARIA (late 20s), asleep in bed. She's
              breathtakingly beautiful. Morning light fills the room.      The
              sound of wind, and rippling cloth.
<b>          
</b>              Maria stirs, and opens her eyes.     She stretches contentedly.
<b>          
</b>              Then she frowns.    Rolls over.    She's alone in the bed?
<b>          
</b>              No, she's not: PETER (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her.
              Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     MARIA
</b>                        Hey.     Are you okay?
<b>          
</b>              Peter doesn't turn. He slowly stands and walks forward
              towards an OPEN WINDOW.
<b>          
</b>              There's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly,
              almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles.
<b>          
</b>              Maria gets out of bed, concerned.
<b>          
</b><b>                                    MARIA
</b>                        Peter?    What's the matter?
<b>          
</b>              He pauses at the window.    Turns his head to look back at her.
<b>          
</b>              His eyes are vacant.    His face is a blank.
<b>          
</b>              Then Peter slowly leans forward.     And falls from the window.
<b>          
</b>              Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from
              outside reaches her ears. Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from below.
<b>          
</b>              Aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards
              the window. We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL --
<b>          
</b>              -- PETER'S BODY lies in the middle of the street.     His head
              has burst open, his body broken and twisted.
<b>          
</b>              ON THE PAVEMENT: a line of blood appears, moving down the
              center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see --
<b>          
</b>              -- the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS.
              A translation appears over them: "The Grudge."

</b>               Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is
<b>          
</b>               KAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for
               someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a
               heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.
<b>

<b>          
</b>               She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American)
               approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand --
<b>          
</b>               -- and together, they force their way through the throng,
               trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by
               the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer.

                         train station.
<b>          
</b>               He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still
               holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on.
               She sees the smile on his lips a moment before --
<b>          
</b>               -- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the
               crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all.
<b>          
</b>               It's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   But
               then she pulls away, shy.

<b>          
</b>               There's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET.   Doug and Karen
               deftly slip out of the traffic --

</b>               -- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away
               from the crowded thoroughfare.
<b>          
</b>               Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES,
               making out on the street corner. He turns to give Karen a
               sarcastic look --

</b>          -- but she didn't notice the school kids. She's looking in
          the other direction, at a trickle of SMOKE wafting up over a
          nearby fence.

</b><b>                              KAREN
</b>                    What's that?
<b>          
</b>          Doug follows as she walks toward an OLD TEMPLE, nestled
          beneath a skyscraper. A collision of the ancient and modern.
          The fence surrounds a GRAVEYARD adjacent to the temple.

</b>                    Yeah, but I've never seen this
                    before.
<b>          
</b>          A JAPANESE MAN stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a
          bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.

</b><b>                              KAREN
</b>                    It's a Buddhist ritual. The
                    incense smoke carries the prayers
                    to the spirits of his ancestors, to
                    help them remain at peace.

</b>          CLINK. She turns as Doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with
          his Zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it.

</b><b>                              DOUG
</b>                    It's amazing. You're like this
                    infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or
                    trivia. I'm not sure which.

</b><b>                              KAREN
</b>                    It's not trivia. It's what they
                    believe. And it's far better, by
                    the way, than your little pollution
                    ritual.
<b>          
</b>          Doug's grin softens to a smile. He doesn't respond... but
          the way he's looking at Karen makes her curious:

          cigarette and crushing it. Finally:

</b>               Then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a

               inches from Emma's terrified face.

</b>               And he's dragging his dead wife's body.   By the hair.

               imposing, more ominous, than before. It's dark and

                walking down when she looks up, noticing THE LIGHTS at the
                top floor FLICKERING.
<b>

                pauses and looks down, over the railing.
<b>          
</b>                There's nothing there -- but the sound continues, growing
                louder, like something is moving up towards her.

</b>                Just then, the lights on the top floor finally GO OUT.
<b>          
</b>                Susan's breath catches in her throat as she looks up --
<b>          
</b>                The lights on the next floor go out. And the next. The
                darkness above growing closer with each darkening floor.
<b>          
</b>                Susan nervously looks back down -- the SCRAPING is even
                closer. And then, for an instant, she sees A SKINNY PALE
                HAND on the railing two floors down.
<b>          
</b>                Terrified, Susan starts to back up -- but stops as she
                realizes that the darkness from above is almost upon her.

               stacked in every room, in various stages of unpacking.

                tray, quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut.

</b>                Then Yoko moves through the LIVING ROOM to the PHONE BASE --

<b>          
</b>                Yoko dials a number as she walks into THE ENTRANCE HALL.     She
                begins a conversation (in Japanese) as she looks at the
                scattered rubbish on the ground, shaking her head.

</b>                She climbs up to the SECOND FLOOR, pausing to kneel and pick
                up some pieces of crumpled paper, chatting all the while.

</b>                THUD. THUD. Yoko pauses, turning towards the open door to
                the front room. The rhythmic THUMPING continues.

                 are tumbled about the small room. She sighs.
<b>          
</b>                 Then she notices the CERAMIC CAT on the shelf, FACING HER
                 (where Susan left it).   Apparently she's not a big fan of

                    There was a book in the closet,

                    Perhaps someone moved it. Did you

<b>          
</b>          A pool of liquid. Right by the front doors, where the ladder
          stood earlier. It's too dark to make out what the fluid is.

</b>          Alex looks down at HIS HAND -- it's covered in the liquid.
          And there's a dark HANDPRINT where he grabbed the wall.

               eyes, he's staring down at --
<b>          
</b>               THE FILE on his desk.   As if he's afraid to even open it.
<b>          
</b>               But he does. He flips through the photos, pausing on that of
               TOSHIO, but continuing on to THE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of The
               House from three years ago (the one Karen saw), with the
<b>               THREE DETECTIVES.
</b><b>          
</b>               Nakagawa turns to a FRAMED PICTURE on his desk -- it's
               YOUNGER NAKAGAWA at a bar with THREE FAMILIAR DETECTIVES.
               They're off-duty, grinning at the camera. Buddies.
<b>          
</b>               The two photographs share THE SAME THREE DETECTIVES.

<b>          
</b>                Online, Karen pulls up the home page for The Japan Times, an
                English-language newspaper.
<b>          
</b>                She types Toshio's full name into a SEARCH window.

</b>                A LIST of links appear, filling the screen. Karen scans
                them. Tries one. It's not what she's looking for.
<b>          
</b>                She re-enters Toshio's name along with a year -- `2001'.

</b>                As Karen reads it, we catch glimpses of names -- `Toshio',
                `Kayako', `Takeo'. And an ominous phrase: "MURDER/SUICIDE".
<b>          
</b>                Karen clicks a link marked `IMAGE'. A scanned picture of the
                newspaper appears -- the article is on the front page, with
                familiar photos of Toshio, Kayako and Takeo.
<b>

                of the page --
<b>          
</b>                -- PETER. She quickly recognizes him from the picture she
                found in the journal. His name is printed below the photo.
                A picture of Peter and Maria's CONDO BUILDING is next to it.

</b>                 Nakagawa picks up TWO HEAVY OBJECTS, one in each hand, and,

<b>          
</b>                 -- GASOLINE CANS.    Two gallons each.   Full.
<b>          
</b>                 Nakagawa catches his breath. Then he reaches for the lid of
                 one of the cans, starting to unscrew it. His hands are
                 shaking, and the gasoline SPLASHES AROUND inside --

</b>                 -- but then there's ANOTHER SPLASHING SOUND.     From nearby.
<b>

</b>                 THE BATHROOM DOOR. It's closed. The SPLASHING is coming
                 from inside, accompanied by a series of THUDS. The sounds of
                 a small child, STRUGGLING...
<b>

<b>                 INT. THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

<b>          
</b>                 A YOUNG BOY kneeling by the edge of the tub, overflowing with
                 water. His head hangs below the surface.
<b>          
</b>                 Nakagawa immediately drops to the boy, lifting his lifeless
                 head from the water. It's TOSHIO. He's dead. Drowned.
<b>          
</b>                 Before Nakagawa can understand what's happening, the boy's
                 eyes SUDDENLY OPEN, fixing on Nakagawa --

</b>                 -- and then a PALE HAND grabs Nakagawa's head from behind and
                 roughly pushes it into the water, holding him under.
<b>          
</b>                 Nakagawa's LEGS flail and kick as he struggles, his SCREAMING
                 muffled by the water. But finally, his legs become still.

</b>                 Her eyes widen as she sees --

</b>                 Kayako. She looks young and alive... but yet somehow sullen
                 and withdrawn, as if she feels she doesn't belong there.
<b>          
</b>                 She's with a group of fellow students. PETER is in the
                 group, although he and Kayako aren't next to one another.

                 PETER AND MARIA as they give a goofy grin to the camera.

          NAMES. The detectives in charge of the case three years ago.
<b>          
</b>          They all have red lines drawn through them.
<b>          
</b>          Then we PAN UP to see that these are the last names on a
          longer list. We recognize the other names: MATTHEW,
          JENNIFER, and EMMA WILLIAMS; YOKO and ALEX; NAKAGAWA and
          IGARASHI. Everyone who's been in The House.
<b>          
</b>          Everyone who died.   All the names have been CROSSED OUT --
<b>          
</b>          -- except `Nakagawa' and `Igarashi'.    Karen picks up a red
          pen and draws a line through them.
<b>          
</b>          Then we see one final name at the bottom:
<b>          
</b>          `Me.'   Now the only one not crossed out.   The only one left.
<b>          
</b>          Karen puts down her pen.    Then she looks up at --
<b>          
</b>          -- THE WALL, where's she's taped all the pictures and
          articles in a circle.
<b>          
</b>          Karen realizes something.    She reaches for the lamp, and
          turns it closer --
<b>          
</b>          -- the picture in the middle of the "spider's web" is gone.
<b>          
</b>          The photo of The House.
<b>          
</b>          Karen draws a breath. Then, out of the corner of her eye,
          she sees something she hadn't noticed before --
<b>          
</b>          -- a faint red FLASHING from a small table by the kitchen.
<b>          
</b>          She slowly stands. Walks over to it. The flashing red light
          is barely visible on her face, as she looks down at --
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>                Peter stands in the doorway, looking into the MASTER BEDROOM
                of Toshio's parents. His attention is drawn to something
                near the door --
<b>          
</b>                -- a DESK. It's got a computer, some files.     Someone's
                personal work space.
<b>          
</b>                Peter steps to the desk. He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS.
                Family pictures: with father (TAKEO), mother (KAYAKO), and
                son (TOSHIO), holding his black CAT.
<b>          
</b>                KAYAKO'S FACE has been torn out of every one.
<b>          
</b>                Peter notices something underneath the pile of photos -- a
                familiar JOURNAL. The same one Karen found in the closet.
                He opens it.

<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          HIS POV: it's a journal Kayako kept. As Peter flips through
          it, KAYAKO'S VOICE speaks the words...
<b>          
</b>          ...and even though it's mostly Japanese, there's one word we
          recognize, that she's written repeatedly --
<b>          
</b>          -- "Peter". It's been written over and over, in both English
          and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it.
<b>          
</b>          Past the early pages Karen saw, THE WRITING becomes more
          manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl,
          KAYAKO'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading.
<b>          
</b>          Taped on the final page is A PHOTO: PETER with a group of
          his University friends, at a party. Kayako has scribbled
          hearts around his head, and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces.
<b>          
</b>          A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter's face.   It's still wet.
<b>          
</b>          Peter slams the book shut and drops it. As he does, a
          PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside, landing right-side up.
<b>          
</b>          THE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party, talking with MARIA.
          It's clear they're having a great time with one another...
<b>          
</b>          ...but the photo is TORN IN HALF, splitting Maria's face.
          And KAYAKO is visible between them, sadly and stoically
          watching Peter, strands of hair falling down her face.
<b>          
</b>          Peter and Karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same
          time -- and they BUMP SHOULDERS. Karen falls backwards,
          against the wall.
<b>          
</b>          In disbelief, Peter looks around wildly. He reaches out a
          tentative hand, feeling around... Karen moves out of the way.
          She can't understand how this could be happening.
<b>          
</b>          As Peter is about to stand back up, SOMETHING small flutters
          down from above, landing on the floor in front of him.
<b>          
</b>          It's KAYAKO'S FACE.   One of the missing pieces from the torn-
          out photographs.
<b>          
</b>          Peter slowly looks up to see --
<b>          
</b>          -- ALL THE MISSING KAYAKO FACES have been pinned to the
          closet door. Many of the pins go through HER EYES.
<b>          
</b>          And that's when Peter and Karen hear THE FLIES.   Buzzing
          anxiously. Sounds like there's a lot of them.
<b>          
</b>          It's coming from THE CLOSET.   Just behind the torn-out faces.

</b>          HIS POV:   the attic panel is slightly open.
<b>          
</b>          Peter reaches up to open it fully --
<b>          
</b>          -- AND THE UPPER HALF OF KAYAKO swings down.
<b>          
</b>          She's been wrapped in plastic sheeting, mottled splotches of
          blood on the inside. Her neck hangs at an odd angle.

<b>          
</b>                It's coming from Toshio's room. And it's the same rhythmic

<b>          
</b>                Peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads
                quickly down the hall (with Karen following him):

</b>                -- TAKEO, Toshio's father. Eyes rolled back in his head,
                tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips.
<b>          
</b>                He's dead -- he's hanging from the ceiling by BLACK HAIR that
                seems to cover its entire surface. Kayako's hair.

</b>                TOSHIO, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings

</b>                 The EMTs secure the gurney inside and close the doors. Karen
                 fights the drug, but its grip is inevitable: she finally
                 gives up, sliding into a medicated sleep.
<b>          
</b>                 We slowly MOVE IN on her face, until it fills the screen.
<b>          
</b>                 Then...

</b>          132c                                                           132c

</b>                 ...the light CHANGES. Darkness becomes morning sunlight
                 spilling across Karen's face. The tranquil sound of birds
                 CHIRPING surrounds us. But it sounds like a distant echo.
<b>          
</b>                 Karen's eyelids flutter. She opens her eyes and sits up, now
                 wide awake -- but peaceful and calm.
<b>          
</b>                 She gently swings her legs from the gurney and walks to the
                 window, confused by the daylight. She looks out to see --

</b>          132d                                                           132d
<b>                 EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY
</b>                 It's the most beautiful we've ever seen it.   A lush
                 springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around the place.
<b>          
</b>                 VOICES off-screen (Japanese) are audible, getting closer --

</b><b>          
</b>          ON KAREN, as she is surprised to see...
<b>          
</b>          KAYAKO. Beautiful and meek. She's smiling, walking hand-in-
          hand with TAKEO. A happy couple.
<b>          
</b>          As they reach the front door and go inside, Kayako turns back
          to the front gate. She smiles and gestures, "come on".
<b>          
</b>          And then TOSHIO walks forward, through the gate.   His
          attention is on a tiny BLACK KITTEN in his arms.
<b>          
</b>          At the door, Toshio turns to look back over his shoulder --
<b>          
</b>          -- DIRECTLY AT KAREN. They hold each other's gaze for a
          moment, as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance.
<b>          
</b>          Then Kayako gestures to Toshio, and he turns away, entering
          The House and closing the door.
