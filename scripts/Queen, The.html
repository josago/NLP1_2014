</b>          It's Election Day 1997. Up and down the country, the PEOPLE
          OF BRITAIN, people of all shapes and sizes and denominations,
          black and white, young and old, are going to the Polls.

</b>
          The most instantly recognisable Palace in the world.

          The Royal Standard, (the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic
          harp-strings that signals the Monarch's presence), flutters
          on the roof.

          We're in a state room at Buckingham Palace. A TV plays in the
          corner..

                   old, arriving at the polling station
                   of his constituency in Sedgefield.."

</b>          QUEEN ELIZABETH II, wearing formal robes of the Garter, is
          posing for an official portrait by an elderly black PORTRAIT
          ARTIST, (representative, one assumes, of one of the many
          Charities of which she is patron)..

                     Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they
                    opened. First in line. Seven o'clock.

                    If he wins, he'll be the youngest
                   Prime Minister in almost two hundred

</b>                   Certainly not. We're in danger of
                   losing too much that's good about this

                   how big will his landslide be? And how
                   extensive, how sweeping will the
                   modernisation programme be that he
                   ushers in?"

                   Not the actual ticking of the box,
                   although, I suppose, it would be nice
                   to experience that ONCE.

</b>          The QUEEN's face. Fast asleep. It's shortly before 8.00 am.
          Daylight filters through the curtains. As does something

</b>          The inner courtyard of Buckingham Palace. In a ritual
          unchanged since Queen Victoria, a uniformed PIPER, wearing a
          kilt of Ancient Hunting Stuart tartan, marches under her
          Majesty's windows, playing the bagpipes.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          Darkness. A soft knock at the door. (The strains of bagpipes
          can still be heard from below). Her Majesty's DRESSER sticks
          her head round the corner, with a calling tray of Earl Grey
          tea and the newspapers.

<b>          
</b>          The QUEEN's hand reaches for spectacles, then for the

</b><b>          
</b>          The QUEEN and JANVRIN walk through a corridor of the Palace.
          It has the air of a grand hotel. Chintz. Flock. Long, gilded
          mirrors. Portraits on the walls..

</b>                   Yes. On the one hand his background is
                   quite establishment. Father a
                   Conservative. A public school
                   education at Fettes, where he was
                   tutored by the same man as the Prince
                   of Wales.

                   shake-up of the Constitution in three
                   hundred years.

                   married to a woman with known anti-
                   Monarchist sympathies - you may
                   remember her curtsey the first time
                   you met. It could best be described as
                   `shallow'.

                   atmosphere at Downing Street to be
                   very informal. Everyone on first name

</b>          The QUEEN drifts off..
<b>          
</b><b>                               ELIZABETH
</b>                   I was. A girl.
<b>          
</b>          Then pulls herself back..
<b>          
</b><b>                               ELIZABETH
</b>                   But I can see the world has changed.
                   And one must 'modernise'.
<b>          
</b><b>                               TONY
</b>                   Well, perhaps that's where I can help.
<b>          
</b><b>                               ELIZABETH
</b>                   (with a twinkle as they set off)
                   Don't get ahead of yourself Prime-
                   minister, I think you'll find that I'm
                   supposed to be advising YOU!

</b>          The corridor outside. As the QUEEN passes JANVRIN, he
          surreptitiously looks at his watch, and raises his eyebrow.
          The QUEEN smiles..
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          FOOTMEN open double-doors which lead out into the gardens.
          The QUEEN and the PRIME MINISTER walk out..
<b>          
</b><b>                               ELIZABETH
</b>                   So...what might we expect in your
                   first Parliament?
<b>          
</b>          TONY clears his throat, then..
<b>          
</b><b>                               TONY
</b>                   Well, Ma'am, top of the list is
                   education reform. We want to radically
                   reduce classroom sizes...
<b>          
</b>          Our CAMERA slowly pulls back over the gardens, until the
          QUEEN and TONY are two dots in the distance...
<b>          
</b>          Time has moved on. Sand has covered the footprints.
<b>          
</b>          The momentary hiccup that was `Diana' already long
          forgotten..
