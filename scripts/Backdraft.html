               Darkness. Then the GLINT of a flashlight. Its beam rocks 
               crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room 
               as we hear two children arguing.

</b>                         You're doing it wrong.

               It's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping 
               beam of light. Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef 
               on steel batons. Bent, stained helmets hung like African 
               masks.

               Beneath them BRIAN, 7, and STEPHEN, 12, are trying to struggle 
               into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their 
               pajamas.

               The door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in. It's a 
               fire station storage room full of fire gear. A fireman stands 
               in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; DENNIS 
               McCAFFREY.

                         He never does it right.

                         Well, let's have a look.

</b>
               The two boys tromp out of the closet. The rubber turn-out 
               boots are as high as their thighs. The ends of the coats 
               drag on the floor. They salute, Brian's arm just an empty 
               sleeve. Dennis kneels down and re-fastens Brian's coat.

<b>                                     DENNIS
</b>                         Your brother's right. If you don't 
                         fasten these correctly they could 
                         open and you'd get burned.

               A young fireman, ADCOX, appears with the dispatch card.

                         We'll be back in a few minutes.
                              (to Brian)
                         How 'bout it, sport?

</b>                         Sure!

               Dennis scoops Brian up and loads him into the fire engine 
               cab. The other three firemen climb aboard and take their 
               places.

<b>               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY
</b>
               There's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine 
               is pulling out of the station.

<b>                                     DENNIS
</b>                         Hit the button, Brian.

               Brian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light 
               snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down 
               the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last 
               instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older 
               brother.

               They stick their tongues out.

<b>               EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER
</b>
               The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched 
               between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at 
               intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on 
               sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency 
               lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.

<b>               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER
</b>
               Lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block. 
               Medium deal. The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping 
               off like ship rats. Dennis opens his door, hops down, and 
               pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his 
               son.

<b>                                     DENNIS
</b>                         Stay near the truck.
                              (winks)
                         And keep an eye out for us, huh? 
                         We're short handed today.

               Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. Dennis 
               smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward 
               a doorway they disappear into. Brian climbs down from the 
               cab.

</b>                         Don't stray too far, little man.

               Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better 
               look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking 
               on purpose.

<b>               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER
</b>
               There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian 
               watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox 
               onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window 
               over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke.

               Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed 
               with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony. 
               A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out 
               the frame with his axe, and dives in.

               A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, 
               smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing 
               to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a 
               ladder.

               Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than 
               life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between 
               fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling 
               darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, 
               he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing 
               a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. 
               The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh, 
               don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head 
               staring up in astonishment.

               Nobody else has noticed it.

               Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window; 
               probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian 
               starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,

<b>                                     BRIAN
</b>                         Dad...

               He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is 
               happening very fast in slow motion:

               -- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole 
               as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that 
               beckons him as -- 

               Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him 
               clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling 
               fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT 
               and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm 
               that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood, 
               and something metal that cracks against the pavement and 
               spins slowly.

               A fire helmet.

               And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, 
               hopeless tears streaming down his face.

</b>                         Get us some backup! We need some 
                         goddamn backup!

               And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet 
               spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is 
               raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to 
               its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at 
               the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we 
               read the printing on the neck guard.

</b>
               And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, 
               protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian 
               doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his 
               father's helmet, And puts it on.

               The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures 
               the instant.

               Hold on the freeze-frame. Let it become an aged cover of 
               LIFE. The magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now it's 
               sitting atop a box of knick-knacks jostling in the back seat 
               of an aging BMW. There's plenty of other boxes here, a live 
               on the move, and in the driver's seat, BRIAN McCAFFREY, now 
               27. There's piles of empty burger wrappers, Coke cans, and 
               Florida knick-knacks on the dash board; a little blow-up 
               palm tree, a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with "McCaffrey

               Brian walks through its sculpted columns, straightening his

               The ACADEMY CHIEF sits at his desk going over a file. Out

               lights or anything else that gets in their way. Brian suddenly 
               hits the brakes, SCREECHING to a stop. They roll down their 
               windows. Far off can be heard the wind-up of a siren.

               SCREECH. They fly around a corner, down a block, and there 
               it is, lights flashing up ahead. Brian GUNS it, roars up 
               alongside the fire engine. Tim leans out the window, shakes 
               a bottle of beer, and lets loose a foamy eruption in the 
               truck driver's face.

               As Brian and Tim pull up two engine companies are already 
               dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode 
               earlier. Tim cheers the firemen on like a drive-in movie.

               Brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination. Embers 
               whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him.

               One of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. He 
               watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person 
               would run for their life from. Jesus Christ. FLASH -- Brian 
               turns at the blinding snap of a camera. Several locals are 
               gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. Brian 
               notices that right away. It takes a beat longer to notice 
               the CHARRED CORPSE stuffed head-first through the windshield. 
               It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy 
               angles. A dog barks furiously at it.

               The brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy 
               clouds of dirty white steam. And one of the firemen is coming 
               back out now, walking toward Brian.

               When he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask 
               and helmet and we shudder with Brian, because the man is a 
               dead ringer for HIS FATHER.

                         a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we 
                         decided in the interest of brotherly

               And Stephen turns for his own men, Tim staring at Brian as

               A flame LEAPS up into the foreground. Touches a cigarette. 
               The cigarette glows, lingers, then lowers slowly from the 
               mouth of RIMGALE, fifty-five years old and six and a half 
               feet of solid granite. Wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks 
               tucked into fire department rubber boots, he takes another 
               slow drag. Looks at the body stuffed into the windshield. 
               It's twenty yards away from the brownstone. Stephen looks up 
               as Rimgale drops the cigarette, crushes it with his boot, 
               and crosses the street to the building.

               Charred walls hiss and snap in the steamy darkness. Rimgale 
               is there, gloomy in the beam of his flashlight. He crouches 
               down, plays his flashlight along the ruined baseboard.

               Stephen is leaning in the doorway, watching him.

               Rimgale's flashlight finds a wall socket that he pries loose 
               and holds up to the light. He lowers it, takes in the walls,

               Tim's talking to his cousin. Brian hangs back, watches the 
               body-bag people load the Porsche driver into a meat wagon. 
               There's a still an audience for this, still stray dogs 
               circling and barking. Brian walks up, looks inside the car, 
               and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a FINGER.

               back to the fire engine. They share a brief, edgy glance.

               A modest one. South-side Irish old fashioned. Brian walks 
               up. There's a little kid, about five, playing with a toy

</b>
               A simple one-room walk-up. A stereo blares Chicago blues as 
               Brian buttons up his uniform in the mirror. He steps back, 
               looks at himself, -- and oh man what the hell am I doing...

<b>               EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - STREET - MORNING

               Brian climbs into his car, turns the key -- nothing. He gets 
               out, looks under the hood, then SLAMS it down in frustration.

<b>               INT. ELEVATED TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
               A pissed-off Chicago, hauling itself off to work in the 
               morning snap, passes by Brian's window. Tough Midwestern 
               brick. Tough Midwesterners. Heads-down in their 150 year war 
               with a wind committed to pushing the whole damn thing into 
               Lake Michigan.

<b>               EXT. EL STATION - MORNING

               The train clacking away above him, Brian walks down the 
               sidewalk carrying his fire equipment. He turns a corner and 
               comes on.

<b>               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - MORNING
</b>
               Brian stands there. It's his dad's station. Turn of the 
               century abused. Sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of 
               faded red doors that suddenly CRANK OPEN as Brian comes up 
               the drive. Fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights 
               flashing, pull out onto the apron.

               The fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is 
               Stephen. One look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we 
               know this isn't Fireman McCaffrey but Fire LT. McCaffrey.

               Tim, in ladder truck 46, waves a small bye-bye as both rigs 
               begin heading down the street.

               Brian bolts full-out for the engine. At the last instant 
               before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags 
               him aboard.

                         And he never calls, he never writes...

               Brian shouts over the noise to GRINDLE, 35, one more seat 
               down.

               Grindle sticks his nose out the window, sniffs, then begins 
               buckling up his coat.

               Smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a 
               five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up.

                         need some back-up.

               Everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks. Adcox drags 
               the rig's suction line to the hydrant. A beautiful illegally 
               parked Mercedes is blocking the way.

               Whistling to himself, Adcox SMASHES the brass coupling through 
               the passenger window, runs the line through and SMASHES it 
               out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant.

               Stephen and Grindle pull hose off the bed and move out. 
               Brian's so jacked up he can't get his air tank on right. 
               Schmidt calmly helps him into his gear.

               Stephen, Adcox and Grindle are crouched at the door, ready 
               to go. Brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when 
               he's cut-off by dazed Latin workers shouting incoherently at 
               him in SPANISH.

               Brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the 
               hose line. Stephen reaches over and re-adjusts Brian's air 
               tank strap.

               Stephen eases the door open. Thick smoke rolls sickly out 
               over their heads.

               hump the hose up one staircase after another, crawling on 
               their hands and knees toward a dull red glow. Turning a

               Totally ablaze. Brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting 
               waves of flame in the ceiling, at the SCREECHING timbers 
               crumbling to the white-hot floor. At the walls HOWLING in 
               bestial agony. It is the most horrifying, and wonderful thing

               Adcox and Grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight, 
               expecting the worst. Adcox opens up the nozzle, turning loose 
               a high pressure BLAST OF WATER into the ceiling. The fire 
               SCREAMS in manic anger and HEAVES a cloud of HOWLING steam 
               that WHIRLS back and BAKES them like lobsters. Brian gasps 
               for air as swirling ash batters his facemask. A window 
               somewhere EXPLODES. Somebody shouts. Christ, you can't see

               The chase is on! Going for the throat while the fire's 
               confused and defensive, the firemen SCRAMBLE through the 
               boiling cloud. They hit it in the ceiling, in the walls, 
               forcing it back and back. It HOWLS and CLAWS in anger, 
               furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces. 
               The walls ECHO with its SCREAMS as it retreats to a corner.

               Brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the 
               building water system. He goes to unscrew the cap with his 
               hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut.

               The firemen hesitate. PENGELLY, the Truck Company Lt., looks 
               at Stephen with concern.

               The crews immediately gather in the center of the floor. 
               They turn over tables, chairs, anything to form a barrier. A 
               circling of the wagons. -- BOOM! rush-rush-rush -- BOOM! 
               Each louder than the last. Stephen and Brian are ducked behind 
               an overturned desk. Adcox and Krizminski clutch hoselines 
               like frontiersmen's Winchesters.

               apart as all four walls of factory windows EXPLODE in a hail 
               of glass. A wave of HOWLING FLAME POURS IN after it, SHRIEKING 
               and HISSING.

               At the same moment, part of the floor beside a heavy sewing 
               machine GIVES WAY and a ladderman, SANTOS, FALLS THROUGH, 
               grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames BELLOW UP 
               from underneath. He SCREAMS as his grip loosens.

               Grindle leaps to the ladderman's side, grabbing his arms and 
               coat. Brian hesitates just an instant and Stephen SHOVES him 
               out of the way to back up Grindle.

               Adcox's taken the hoseline and is opening fire. Water and 
               flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling 
               ROAR. It's a thrashing, murderous standoff.

               Stephen and Grindle have got Santos but the angle's bad. 
               Blow it now and all three could take a header. Santos is 
               panicking, losing his grip. Grindle bores his eyes into the 
               man's with the calm and conviction of Moses.

               They may all die, but they won't leave him. He calms a little, 
               hangs on till they PULL him out of harm's way. Adcox continues 
               with the hose as suddenly, everyone HITS the deck as the 
               fire EXPLODES over them, BURSTING their coats into flame. 
               Tim's company opens up their line, WASHING everybody down 
               before CHARGING after the fire. A ladderman, NIGHTENGALE, 
               steps on Brian's back.

               Brian, stunned, sits up, his coat and helmet smoking. Stephen 
               seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over 
               the top of the barricade, the others backing him as he 
               mercilessly drives the fire back, trapping it finally into a 
               corner. The fire hisses, spits, shakes the walls with its 
               furious anger. But it's all bluster now, the fire's dying.

               small voice. Faint. "Help me..."

               It's only the fire's ghost here, lazy and slow.

               Off the corridor are rooms full of commercial sewing machines. 
               Brian enters one and drops to his knees.

               Looks under a table, flashes his light behind a work stand. 
               Nothing. He turns to backtrack his way out when A TONGUE OF 
               FLAME suddenly LEAPS up through the floor in front of him, 
               cutting off the door. Brian lands on his ass as it hisses 
               and giggles and dances unreally in front of him.

               I never forget a face, kid. -- That fire from childhood. He

               -- Brian ROLLS away from it. Looks for another doorway -- 
               And ends up in thick smoke. He drops to a crawl, stays on 
               his belly where the air's clear. When he sees it. Behind 
               some furniture. Something flesh-colored. Shit. It's a body. 
               He crawls up closer. It's a woman. Adrenalin pounding the 
               top of his skull off, he grabs her and stumbles back down 
               the hall, makes a turn --

               A sea of media flashbulbs ERUPTS in his face. The press have 
               arrived in force, crowding the street. Brian pushes through 
               them to a clear spot on the far side of the engine. Two fire 
               paramedics rush over as he lowers the figure.

               They step aside. Brian looks down. The woman looks strange. 
               Mostly because she's a heavy store DRESSING DUMMY. The 
               paramedics burst into laughter. Brian, looking pale and 
               shaken, turns and walks away. He passes Grindle and Tim, 
               sitting on the pumper's tailboard helping the REAL woman 
               that was found inside.

               Brian wanders off, tries to help out with the choking clog 
               of singed factory employees before finally turning quickly

               between them. Rimgale turns from his work, watches Stephen 
               with concern. Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-face 
               with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred.

               and sees a DOG. Sort of. It has the rib cage of a wild beast,

               On the wall is a small glass case full of station memorabilia

               Everybody digs in. The table is a craze of half a dozen 
               different conversations. On the TV mounted above on the wall 
               are news shots of Seagrave's body sticking out of the 
               windshield.

               Adcox stands and tinks his glass with a spoon for silence.

                              (company laughs)
                         I think it appropriate that we 
                         recognize the two asswipes -- I mean 
                         probationary firemen -- among us who 
                         today were baptized officially into 
                         the world of Old Man Fire. First to 
                         Tim, who despite being handicapped 
                         at birth with a rather dull expression 
                         and a really hideous pair of ears, 
                         not only took on the beast but pulled 
                         from its clutches -- assisted by a 
                         more famous and brilliant firefighter -- 
                         me -- a kicking and screaming civilian 
                         that will probably end up suing us 
                         for breaking her fingernail.
                              (laughs)
                         And to Brian, who's own contribution 
                         was both more beautiful and less 
                         likely to sue.

               Adcox puts his arm affectionately around the mannequin, seated 
               with honor at the head of the table. Right beside The Thing.

               Dawn lightens the room as Brian slowly opens his eyes and 
               sees in extreme, fish-eyes close-up: THE THING GROWLING at 
               him. Brian turns the other direction and sees Stephen, fully

               That's been cleared out for a huge PARTY in full swing. An

               and their families all mix together for this is a RETIREMENT 
               PARTY for the Captain Fitzgerald. Brian enters, seeks out a 
               beer at the bar. Stephen's there, swaying with what is clearly 
               not his first drink of the evening.

               CHEERS as a one joke gift after another is laid on the Chief. 
               Stephen sees his ex-wife, Helen, dancing with another man. 
               He turns away.

               Stephen just shrugs.

               Brian sees Jennifer across the room. She looks great. Refined 
               as she expertly works the room, schmoozing and hugging and 
               calling various politicos by their first name.

               As she speaks to one, a waiter offers a drink. As she accepts, 
               a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red 
               syrup.

               Her attention broken, the politico has slipped away. Annoyed, 
               Jennifer leads Brian aside and speaks low, but angrily at 
               him.

               and switches stunningly into schmmoze-mode.

               A ladderman, WASHINGTON, walks in with a memo.

               Everybody clasps Pengelly on the shoulder. "Way to go". "All

               floor, watching. Watches. Pengelly's younger than him.

<b>               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - TRAINING BUILDING/HOSE TOWER - DAY

               An expanse of concrete lying out back of the station. Built 
               in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training 
               building, just wide enough for a stairway and room on each 
               level. Twenty yards away, Brian, Tim and Adcox stand ready 
               beside a pile of coiled hose rolls.

                         Alright... Go!

               Tim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his 
               shoulder and runs with Adcox to the foot of the building. 
               There's a fixed standpipe that Adcox ties into as Tim drags 
               the other end inside and up a flight of stairs.

               Brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the 
               building.

               Brian runs up two flights to meet Tim and connect his end. 
               Tim heads down for another roll as Brian drags his up another 
               two flights. It's a bitch.

               Sweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing Tim coming 
               up with another roll.

                         Brian.

               Brian holds it under his arm and takes off. Stephen grabs a 
               roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside.

               They come to the doorway. Instead of stopping, Stephen follows 
               Brian in and runs alongside up the stairs. Without a word 
               spoken it's become a race between them.

               Brian's face explodes in sweat. His heart pounds as they go 
               up flight after flight. The hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds. A 
               thousand. Neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats 
               burning, only one flight from the roof Stephen STUMBLES and 
               SCRAPES his leg. Brian pauses. Stephen's already back on his

               Brian does, Stephen already gaining on him -- getting ready 
               to pass him -- when they burst gasping out onto the roof, 
               Brian the "winner" by a nose. Stephen drops his hose roll, 
               sticks his face into Brian's, -- And laughs. Unsure, Brian 
               starts to join in. Stephen stops suddenly.

                         hoseline coming.

               Stephen doesn't even pause and enters the building. Brian 
               hesitates a beat, then follows.

<b>               INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
               Where they bomb up a staircase just as a WALL OF FIRE LASHES 
               DOWN, KNOCKING them on their ass. Stephen jumps to his feet 
               with an axe as Brian struggles to get up.

                         Come on!

               Stephen, with just his axe, CHASES up the stairs at the fire, 
               HAMMERING at the flaming boards. The fire retreats into 
               another room, SLAMMING the door shut behind it.

               Brian struggles up the stairs. The two of them slide up on 
               either side of the closed door, Stephen cradling his axe 
               like a SWAT team shotgun. The door breathes in and out and 
               something animal scratches and snarls on the other side.

               Brian can feel the panic rising in his throat. That thing 
               behind the door, that slobbering, evil thing. It wants out. 
               It wants... him.

                         say... It won't get us.

               Stephen HAMMERS the lock with his axe and KICKS the door 
               open. A WALL OF FLAME ROARS out past their cheeks, then 
               BACKWASHES in.

</b>                         Now!

               Stephen picks up the door, and using it as a shield CHARGES 
               into the flames. Brian tries to follow but the fire WELLS 
               UP, cutting him off. He hesitates. It's that goddamn flame 
               again, leering at him. Daring him. It BUCKS suddenly, DROPPING 
               Brian to his knee. He GROANS in pain.

               -- And now Adcox and Grindle are coming up the stairs with a 
               hoseline WASHING DOWN the room. Clouds of furious steam bellow 
               out and across the ceiling. Nobody could be alive in there.

               Except Stephen. His entire outfit smoldering, he emerges 
               from the clouds like a fucking god, carrying in one arm a 
               gasping child.

               Most of the firemen have gathered together for post-fire 
               coffee and stories. Brian sits off alone on the fire engine 
               bumper, apart from them. Santos walks up.

               Alan Seagrave. He parks in the alley behind, walks up the

               Stephen walks through the creepy, brutalized silence. Back 
               to where Rimgale had focused his investigation that night. 
               He searches the floor, the wall, looking for something...

<b>               EXT. ARSON HQ/FIREHOUSE - DAY

               A crumbling one in Chinatown. Brian checks the address on 
               his slip of paper. He stands there a beat, hating himself.

<b>               INT. FIRE STATION/ARSON HQ

               It's a regular station but for the rear that has been 
               converted into arson squad offices. As Brian approaches the 
               office door he can see Rimgale sitting at his desk. Standing 
               nervously beside it is a fresh-faced, uniformed PROBIE.

                         by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, 
                         by me, not to do anything up there 
                         until ordered. But now the itch 
                         starts, and all of a sudden comes 
                         the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, I'm a hero.

                         on your own you decided to punch out 
                         a window for ventilation. Was that 
                         before or after you noticed you were 
                         standing in a lake of gasoline?

               The kid is dying a thousand deaths of humiliation.

                         Probie. Go home and think about that.

               The kid shuffles off hang-dog. Rimgale's angry gaze falls on 
               Brian.

               And Rimgale walks into his office, leaving Brian marooned in 
               the doorway. Stepping behind a small partition, Rimgale 
               changes his shirt. Brian can just glimpse from where he stands 
               a horrible burn that has consumed most of Rimgale's stomach.

               wisp of smoke SUCK back under the door. Benton sniffs, as if 
               he smells something, then shrugs and inserts his key. It'd 
               have been a good story if he'd lived longer.

               "Him" is our previous owner, David Benton, just his hands 
               and a leg showing from under the collapsed door. Rimgale 
               crouches beside it.

               Brian does. The corpse's keys are still in the lock. So's 
               Benton. Blown with such force he seems fused with the door. 
               On the door's edge Rimgale notices a small patch of melted, 
               sticky goo. With his penknife he scrapes a sample and seals

               severely damaged. He probes with a penknife.

                         spawling of rough coat...

               Rimgale follows the damaged wall down -- down -- to a melted 
               wall socket.

                         out. Carefully.

               Brian chops it out from the wall. Rimgale crouches down, 
               peels back the melted faceplate and examines the wires. The 
               copper tip is severely melted. Rimgale sniffs the plug.

                         outlet is melted, which requires 
                         5000 degrees. An accidental short in

               Brian follows Rimgale down from the office into the vast 
               theatre. Walls hiss and spit. Brian's surprised to see his

               the wall. It's endless.

               There's a pike pole leaning against the wall. Brian pulls it 
               aside. SPLASH -- The pole had been supporting a small, sagging 
               piece of ceiling that instantly collapses, dumping twenty 
               gallons of murky, putrid black water all over Brian's civvys.

               If you say so. Brian's stomach does a half-gainer as he's 
               confronted by two hideously charred bodies.

                         with stationary objects; office door 
                         for Mr. Cosgrove, '89 Porsche for

                         Attitude of both trajectories 
                         consistent with explosions.

               Brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze, whistling quietly to 
               himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf.

                         from both crispers' front doors. 
                         It's a combination of plumber's putty 
                         and rayophene gum. Burns almost

               Ricco lifts Benton's charred shoulder. Underneath we see

               A Latin band cuts loose as beautiful people mill about against 
               a beautiful Chicago skyline. An AIR HORN blows, and suddenly 
               the skyline is MOVING. We're on a huge, private party boat.

               Brian's leaning on the boat railing watching the passing 
               parade of rich and beautiful. Across the sea of champagne 
               and brie, he spots Jennifer talking with her boss, Swayzak. 
               He has his hand on her back.

               Jennifer spots Brian. She smile, detaches herself and walks 
               over.

                         Let's get a picture.

               Swayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around Brian's 
               shoulder. Another staffer slaps a SWAYZAK FOR MAYOR sticker 
               to Brian's lapel. Jennifer rolls her eyes to Brian. I'm

                         What does he do again?

               Swayzak leads her off in pursuit. Left alone, Brian turns to 
               the railing, stares off at the passing city. You can hear 
               the wind-up of a siren.

               And there it is now, an engine company zooming along Wacker 
               Drive. Something digs and kicks inside of Brian as he watches 
               it disappear.

               Both of them look up sharply. A woman drunk out of her mind 
               has tipped over in her chair. She laughs, her fellow 
               tablemates laugh, everybody laughs. Jennifer takes Brian by 
               the arm in the opposite direction and smiles.

               The band's completely cut loose now. A wild percussion rhythm 
               that has everyone on their feet dancing like madmen. Brian 
               and Jennifer stomp and sweat and shake and giggle through 
               hair crazily askew. The lakeshore is twinkling and wonderful 
               as it slips past. The drums beat faster and harder and the

               packed in for the night, leaving the apparatus floor quiet 
               and dim as Brian and Jennifer enter.

               Brian leads her back past the engine and arson sedan to the 
               rear where Rimgale has his offices. As they walk Jennifer's 
               eyes drift up to the old sculpted parapets, the press-tin

               The elevator stops. DING. The door opens. No howling blaze, 
               not even any noise, but enough hanging smoke that you can't 
               see your hand in front of your face.

               They fan out gingerly onto the floor, looking for the fire. 
               Hide and seek in a white fog bank. Everybody stops and 
               listens. Slowly, carefully, they feel their way through the 
               haze.

               On cue something snakes past behind the walls, whispers and 
               whines and shivers up and over them and then is silent. 
               Grindle attaches a hoseline to the building standpipe.

               Adcox folds. With a stricken look on his face he takes his 
               crew down the other way. Stephen and Tim slowly feel their 
               way.

               Tim looks confused. He doesn't get it.

               They come to a side door. Stephen runs his hand down the 
               jam, feels for heat. Then he steps back, takes a deep breath, 
               and CRASHES the door down with one AXE BLOW. Quiet inside.

               And before either of them realizes it, they're suddenly 
               pulling out into the street and WAILING off down the block. 
               The wind's wild in their hair, the siren deafening, the 
               flashing red lights blinding staccato, And Jennifer loves 
               it. She kisses Brian fiercely, he lets out a war whoop lost

               Engine 17 pulls up into the parking lot of the high-rise 
               fire. Firemen leap out of the cab and rush around behind to 
               pull off lengths of hose from the bed. As the folds curl 
               away the fireman is stunned to see a woman's stocking come 
               out with it.

               With equal shock he looks up and watches as a disheveled and 
               grinning Brian and Jennifer climb calmly down out of the

               Stephen BANGS down another door. Sticks his head in to check. 
               A little woodpecker toy dips up and down in a glass of water.

               Tim readies his axe before his door, gathers his courage as 
               Stephen comes out of the room he was checking. Sees Tim 
               lifting his axe.

               Tim's committed now, coming hard at the door. And Stephen 
               sees it for just an instant -- Small tendrils of smoke edging 
               lazily around the door -- then being sucked back in.

               He rushes for Tim as Tim's axe SMACKS the door and a whine

               wall and for an instant he's okay but he freezes in terror 
               as A SHRIEKING TONGUE OF FLAME SHOOTS OUT THE DOORWAY and 
               Grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames 
               wrap Tim like a jealous lover as Adcox hears it and screams,

               And Tim's screaming now too, because his helmet, his mask, 
               his face, it's all melting and Grindle dives suicidally at 
               the monster, BLASTING it with his hose as Stephen ignores 
               the flames and puts his arms around Tim as Grindle DOUSES 
               them both, killing the flames.

               The monster rolls wounded back into the room, into the air 
               shafts as Tim whimpers incoherently, sliding down the wall 
               as Stephen tries to help but oh God you can't tell what's 
               face and what's mask and helmet anymore.

               Grindle looks back where the fire came from. There's a corpse 
               in there, burned and lying between two doors.

               Adcox rushes to Tim's side sobbing and it's the end, the end

               it's Tim. Jennifer turns away in horror. They load Tim into

               his hand.

               Stephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street. 
               Frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat 
               and slams it to the ground. He kicks it, kicks it till his

               is there, sitting in the short stretch of hall between two 
               blown doors. Through the haze Rimgale sees Stephen crouched 
               in the interior room, picking at the debris. Lost in himself.

               Stephen stands and looks around the room, seemingly unaware 
               of Rimgale. He walks wordlessly straight out past him, his 
               eyes streaming with tears.

               sipping a paper cup, leaning against the machine in deep 
               anguish.

               Further down the hall is ICU. Grindle and Santos are there, 
               sitting outside the room, raw and weary. Grindle nods to 
               Brian. Everyone's still stained and smudged from the fire.

               Everyone but Brian.

               Brian looks through a door window into the room. There, 
               surrounded by doctors and physicians, lies Tim. He's been 
               cut out of his uniform. Gauze bandages everywhere. As a pair 
               of forceps peel some away Brian glimpses what used to be a 
               face, now only reds and browns and leaky whites. He turns 
               away.

               Voices rise down the hall. Turn to shouts. It's Adcox and 
               Stephen, tearing heartbreakingly into one another. Brian 
               can't make out the words but it's ugly, emotional. Abruptly 
               it ends and Stephen emerges from the alcove, walking toward

               Brian grabs his arm.

               Stephen SNAPS and roughly PUSHES Brian, knocking him against 
               the wall. Brian comes off it in a flash and is all over 
               Stephen. They go down and it's all thrashing and shouting 
               now. A horrible, endless draw. Grindle and Santos are in it, 
               pulling them apart, holding them up against opposite walls.

               Both brothers glare at one another, tears filling their eyes. 
               Brian shakes Grindle off and walks away.

               Brian walks up to Tim's room. Stephen's sitting there, ragged 
               looking. Inside the young probie lies wrapped in tubes and 
               gauze and years of wasted promise. An EKG beeps, a respirator 
               hisses, and Brian gulps down something heavy in his throat.

               As Rimgale gets out of his car a limousine pulls up. Swayzak

               Cruising through traffic. Swayzak is disheveled, unshaven, 
               fidgety. A man who hasn't slept and had a few drinks before 
               the one he's pouring now. He offers one to Rimgale.

               Rimgale stares at Brian, appraises him.

               A CLOSE UP of Rimgale POPPING the molding around the door

               traces of the same white residue from the other fires.

               Rimgale rubs the white powder between his fingers.

               Rimgale stands at the spot in the short hall where the body

                         the inner door. But the outer door 
                         held... and waited for Tim...

               Brian steps into the inner office.

               Brian's eyes don't understand. From Rimgale's coat comes a 
               plastic flask. He pours out of it a liquid onto the floor 
               and lights a match.

               The fire's climbing a wall, chewing a corner.

                         will spread this way across the floor 
                         not because of the physics of 
                         flammable liquids or heat convection, 
                         but because it wants to.

               FWUMP. It darts west. Licks the ceiling. The fire purrs and 
               hisses. Stretches luxuriously and attacks savagely.

               Brian stares at the flame. A goblin reaching out for him... --

                         I've staked my whole career on you. 
                         And now you're sneaking around this 
                         office, leaking things to the papers 
                         behind my back...

                         Is there something you're not telling 
                         me about these deaths?

               Swayzak's eyes are dead metal.

               And he turns his chair around again. Jennifer stands there a

               Brian drives up and parks. He's half way to the staircase 
               when he sees someone sitting in the dark in a car.

</b>
               A cavernous hall full of dozens of fire trucks loaded on 
               jacks. Rimgale's sedan's there, the repairman shaking his 
               head in amazement at the undercarriage.

                         thing?

               Rimgale's looking through the report Brian's handed him.

</b>                         This is the copy of Swayzak's manning 
                         report that was released. Everybody 
                         on this job knows it's bullshit but 
                         we could never argue with the numbers. 
                         They're all airtight.

</b>                         Yeah? Airtight?

               He dumps three more reports on Rimgale.

</b>                         I've got three different drafts of 
                         the same report -- with different 
                         numbers that're all over the place. 
                         Looks like they were just making it 
                         up as they went along.

                         firm that wrote the report. They did 
                         exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower 
                         study. It's not even really a company. 
                         No employees, no directors, just a 
                         PO Box.

</b>                         It had to be someone who knows 
                         numbers. Some kind of fancy 
                         accountant. But what's the connection?

               Brian hands him something else. A photograph. Swayzak and 
               the other three, posing on a fishing boat, 1970. Time of 
               their lives.

                         had a little heart to heart talk.

<b>               EXT. SWAYZAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The red arson sedan pulls up to wealthy home. Rimgale and 
               Brian walk up and knock on the door -- it creaks open ajar. 
               They push the door open slowly.

<b>               INT. SWAYZAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               It's dark as they enter.

<b>                                     SHADOW
</b>                         Hello? Swayzak?

               Brian and Rimgale split up down different halls. It's the 
               HISS Brian hears first. Then the FLASH of an electrical socket 
               FLARING ice-cold cobalt blue. Suddenly the room's dimensions 
               are there in frantic, strobing shadows. Chairs, a couch --

               -- And a figure that JUMPS Brian. the light from the burning 
               plug is a fierce strobe as the figure, a confused shadow, 
               crashes Brian to the floor. They STRUGGLE.

               The figure GRABS Brian's throat. Brian PUSHES him back

               -- Against the burning wall plug. The figure SHRIEKS in pain, 
               gets his hand on a crowbar and SLAMS Brian -- who crumples, 
               dazed. The figure stands -- just as Rimgale TACKLES him. The 
               figure CRASHES across a gas space heater, SNAPPING the 
               connection off. The figure SLAMS Rimgale HARD with the 
               crowbar, squirms free, and stumbles out the door.

               Hissss... Rimgale climbs to his feet as fire eats at the 
               wall. A baby backdraft wagging its tail. He goes to a dazed 
               Brian's side, lifting him by his armpits and

<b>               EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               helping him outside. Hissss... The ruptured space heater 
               pumps gas furiously. Rimgale sees that. He also sees a bedroom 
               door ajar on the far side of the house. And through the door 
               a couch. And on the couch, A body. Hissss...

<b>               INT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               Rimgale rushes back inside. It's Swayzak, unconscious.

<b>               EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               Rimgale drags him out on the stoop beside Brian just as the 
               gas WHUMPS and the doors and windows EXPLODE in a HOWLING 
               FIREBALL, the shrapnel BLOWING Rimgale off his feet. Brian 
               slowly shakes his head clear. He looks around, tries to orient 
               himself.

<b>                                     SHADOW
</b>                         Uh... I sorta got a problem here...

               Brian climbs up to his feet and walks over to where Rimgale 
               lies at a weird angle, a piece of wrought iron fence punched 
               through his shoulder.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

               Rimgale lies in an emergency room bed.

                         goddamn useless...

               Rimgale suddenly kicks the bed frame in anger. He kicks it 
               over and over with frustration till something finally SNAPS 
               off. Brian waits, let's him vent his frustration.

               Brian's sitting alone in a chair. Finally the opposite door 
               opens and in enters Ronald.

               Brian hands him a stack of murder files.

               Brian still sitting there. Watching Ronald devour the

                         Only there's another fire in there 
                         nobody sees. And it took your dad, 
                         didn't it Brian? Did you see him 
                         burn?

               In a flash, Brian suddenly reaches across and grabs Ronald 
               by the collar.

               And Ronald sees something in Brian's eyes. He smiles.

               Brian climbs up onto Stephen's boat. Nobody home. He opens 
               the cabin door, goes inside and hits the lights.

               Brian sees the chemicals in the corner again and something 
               freezes up inside. Stephen catches the look and there's 
               horrible silence between them.

               Brian stands before the fire station. His brother's and his.

               Brian PRIES the lock off Stephen's locker. Starts looking 
               through it. Adcox comes out of the shower with a towel on, 
               starts shaving in a mirror. He doesn't notice Brian. Adcox 
               turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little. 
               And Brian's universe caves in.

               An icy claw tears out his stomach. Gulping breaths, he forces 
               himself to look at Adcox's back.

               On it is a small, rectangular burn. It's fresh and it's the 
               size of a wall socket. At that moment Adcox turns. The two 
               of them stare at one another just a beat, then Adcox walks 
               past him. Just then the alarm bells RING. Brian hesitates a 
               beat, confused, then turns and runs down to

               Stephen turns and walks toward the station.

               Brian's eyes go to a window just above it. There, watching 
               him, watching the whole exchange between brothers, is Adcox.

               Adcox stares at Brian a beat, then finally disappears as 
               Brian hears the cough of diesel engines.

               -- It's too late. Adcox climbs aboard just as the engine 
               company pulls out and whistles down the street.

               The ladder company is just easing onto the drive. Brian 
               hesitates only an instant, then runs to the equipment racks, 
               PULLS off the hooks his helmet, coat, boots -- and jumps 
               onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit.

               As it howls down the avenue, Stephen turns around and stares

               The laddermen look confused seeing Brian sitting among them.

               A CAR Suddenly CUTS the truck company off. The driver SLAMS 
               the brakes, PUSHING the truck company into a HORRIBLE SKID. 
               The back fishtails, the wheels JUMP the curb, BASH a mailbox, 
               and then the whole rig ROLLS onto its side and DRAGS to a 
               stop.

               It's tangled confusion in the rear cab. Firemen, unhurt, 
               piled atop one another. Brian slides his way out from under 
               them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise 
               six blocks away.

               He starts running.

</b>
               Flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along 
               the river as Brian, panting, runs up. He searches frantically 
               through the maze of arriving engine companies, looking for 
               number 17. There it is but nobody's home. Brian stops a 
               passing captain.

               Brian looks up at the smoke and whirling firestorm four 
               stories above him, feels the bile of fear in his throat, the 
               desperation, -- And begins strapping on an air tank.

</b>
               Brian, now fully suited up, climbs the endless rungs of an 
               extended aerial ladder.

</b>
               Tongues of flame ROCKET skyward through ragged holes. Black 
               clouds drift murderously, roofing tars bubble and hiss as 
               the roof itself GROANS like a comatose dinosaur, reminding 
               you the whole thing could go any minute -- and you with it.

               Trudging alone across this alien, spongy surface, Brian looks 
               for his company. It's almost impossible to tell anyone apart, 
               faces hidden behind helmets and masks.

               Suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and there's two firemen 
               near the edge, "17" on their helmets.

               The helmets look up. Stephen and Adcox. Facing each other. 
               Adcox cradles an axe.

               Brian starts to move beside Stephen but Adcox turns, tightens 
               his grip on the axe, and now all the cards are on the table. 
               A hissing black cloud drifts through. They're the only three 
               people on earth.

               Adcox's eyes are clouded with tears.

               Brian and Stephen are backed up against the roof edge -- 
               sixty feet up. Far below a fireboat has begun pumping a 
               massive stream at the side of the building.

<b>               EXT. WAREHOUSE - ACROSS THE ROOF - NIGHT

               The rest of the crews are totally oblivious to what's 
               happening through the smoke on the other side. Grindle and 
               Santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them.

                         Now!

               Everybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as

<b>               EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - BRIAN ET. AL - NIGHT
</b>
               Brian, Stephen and Adcox react as the roof HOWLS and GROANS 
               and huge SPLITS begin racing along it. And then it goes.

               The center section DROPS, and in rolling waves of SCREECHING 
               steel, the hole spreads outward; DEVOURING.

               Adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole 
               races for them, SWALLOWING roof.

               And Brian balls-out dashes for the edge. Stephen's made one 
               corner, Brian desperately heads for another. At the last 
               instant -- as the HOWLING FLAME BELLOWS UP to his ankles -- 
               Brian LEAPS OFF the roof --

               -- And falls half a story before CRASHING onto an exterior 
               fire escape. Flames have cut off the fire escape two floors 
               below, so Brian climbs down as far as possible, crawls onto 
               a ledge, KICKS out a window, steps through,

               And falls.

<b>               INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</b>
               Blackness and emptiness, two stories of it, before he CRASHES 
               into a pool of water at the bottom. He's in a freight elevator 
               shaft, thrashing madly, drowning. Great SHEETS of WATER are 
               POURING through an upper doorway and CASCADING down like 
               monsoon rain.

<b>               EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIREBOAT

               We see it's coming from the fireboat's rushing stream.

<b>               INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT
</b>
               The weight of his equipment is pulling Brian underwater. 
               Struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water 
               still POURING DOWN, Brian unhooks his air tank. He leans 
               back, tries to float on the rising column of water. -- His 
               coat catches on something -- YANKS him underwater. He 
               struggles feverishly -- finally tears the coat off.

               The building GROANS in earnest. Flaming chunks of plaster 
               CRASH down around Brian, forcing him to duck underwater. The 
               place is coming apart.

               Ten feet above, one of the falling chunks SMACKS a gas main, 
               SPLITTING then IGNITING it. A white-hot JET OF FLAME SHOOTS 
               from one side of the shaft to the other.

               Brian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames.

               Brian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but 
               his nose below water, but he's still moving up -- the heat 
               becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under 
               water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to 
               drown or burn --

               -- When there's a CRASH. And suddenly another door on the 
               shaft is tearing open. There's a glint of an axe. A 
               flashlight.

               It's Stephen.

               Brian has about two seconds left. In that time Stephen sees 
               the shut-off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite. 
               It's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal 
               curtain of flame. Before we can even assimilate that, 
               Stephen's already jumped. A crazy leap over the fire. He 
               SMACKS the opposite wall, HITS the shut-off, and FALLS 
               CRASHING into the pool beside Brian.

               Brian helps him stay above water. The level continues to 
               rise, bringing them finally even with an open doorway they 
               scramble through.

<b>               INT. WAREHOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

               It leads to a stairwell that's become a RAGING TORRENT of

               next doorway and out onto

<b>               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The place is full of hundreds of chemical drums. The fire 
               has cracked its way into the room as WUMP -- drums begin 
               EXPLODING, SHOOTING UPWARD Roman candle fountains of 
               glittering FLAME. Brian helps Stephen as they snake their 
               way past sweating drums -- pressure valves hissing madly 
               with desperation. They duck low, round a corner,

               Stephen JUMPS Adcox and TACKLES him on the edge of a metal 
               platform that extends out from the raised flooring.

               Brian's on his feet now, coming toward them, when a chemical 
               drum below EXPLODES, the shock wave BUCKLING the platform 
               and DROPPING it several feet before it HOLDS. Brian, cut-
               off, is HIT with a wall of debris.

               Adcox and Stephen are FLUNG across the platform and THROUGH 
               the shattered railing. Stephen grabs a piece of broken, 
               dangling strut and hangs on with one hand.

               In his other hand is Adcox. Hanging below him, his grip 
               loosening.

               Brian's struggling to get out from under the debris. The 
               railing Stephen's hanging onto is slick, his hand SLIPPING 
               along it. But he won't let go of Adcox. His eyes bore into 
               his best friend's with absolute conviction.

               The towering shots of FLAME from below have begun to IGNITE 
               Adcox's pant leg. He's starting to burn. But Stephen won't 
               let go. Won't let go even as the flames crawl up Adcox's 
               back. And Stephen's hand is slipping and slipping and then 
               it isn't slipping anymore because it's come off.

               Adcox and Stephen FALL. There's a narrow catwalk half-way 
               down. Stephen HITS with a sickening CRUNCH.

               Adcox falls past it, down into the flames.

               There's an exposed I-beam running from the ruined platform 
               out over the catwalk. Brian climbs up onto it, balances across 
               over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his 
               brother lies, battered but still alive.

               arc. The flame has cut them off from the hose. Stephen sees

               fire. That same one from so many years ago.

               Don't fuck with me, kid. I'm not in the mood.

               Nightengale's lost his helmet and it's lying near the flames 
               spinning slowly upside down -- just like his father's. Brian 
               stands there, paralyzed, as the fire laughs at him. Same old 
               little kid with his finger up his ass. Then something 
               different comes into Brian's eyes.

               There's a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the 
               pole. Brian lifts it, approaches the fire. You can practically 
               hear the flames laugh at him. Brian suddenly turns and SLAMS 
               the neck of the extinguisher against the pole, BREAKING it 
               off before HEAVING the cannister HISSING into the flames 
               where it EXPLODES -- a cloud of extinguisher powder that 
               STUNS the flames just long enough for Brian to dash through 
               and TACKLE the hose.

               The fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill -- Just as 
               Brian spins and HITS it with the STREAM.

               -- And it's like a howling train wreck as the two grapple 
               with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an opening, 
               and they're dashing for the catwalk ladder up to Stephen 
               because the fire doesn't care -- it only has eyes for Brian 
               now --

               -- And Stephen sees Brian tackle the monster, and his eyes 
               fill with tears --

               -- And the fire's pushing Brian -- pushing him with the fury 
               of a frightened street bully -- but Brian won't give -- and 
               now the fire's back's broken -- it's whimpering, dying.

               And Pengelly and Nightengale have climbed up to Stephen now, 
               pulling him away.

               And the fire's just a little gremlin now, sighing sadly as 
               Brian steps up with the hoseline.
