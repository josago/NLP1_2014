<b>          HONG KONG - AN OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE
</b>          Crowded. Filled with oriental and British merchants.
          You can buy anything here. Electronics. Food. Any-
          thing.

<b>          RAND PELTZER
</b>          walks through the owd. An American businessman.1-He
          wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished
          good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old.
          Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people
          and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL,
          WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite
          smile.

<b>          RAND
</b>          Hi. I'm from out of town...
          on business from the U.S.
          The woman nods and smiles.

<b>          AN ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          passes by. He is very old. Deep wrinkles. Long white
          hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile. Overhearing
          Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop.

<b>          RAND
</b>          (explaining to
          Oriental woman)
          I'm looking for a present...
          for my son.
          The woman nods. She searches through her wares. She
          holds up a basketball. Rand shakes his head.

<b>          RAND
</b>          He's not really involved in
          sports...
          The woman puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony
          "Walkman". Rand again shakes his head.,

<b>          RAND
</b>          No. I want something unusual...
          something he can't get at home...
          something different..

<b>          
</b><b>          
</b>
<b>          .2.
</b>
<b>          A HAND
</b>          reaches out and grabs Rand's arm. Startled, he turns.
          The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand's
          eyes.

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          I can help you.
          He leads Rand away from the booth.

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          I offer something very different.
          Very unusual.
          Rand is puzzled. The Oriental leads him to a doorway.

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          Follow me.
          He opens the door, motioning for Rand to follow. Rand
          pauses, skeptical.

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          Come. Take a look. It will cost
          you nothing.
          (a beat)
          You won't be disappointed.
          The Oriental enters. Rand shrugs and follows.

<b>          INSIDE
</b>          Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set of stairs.
          At the top, they enter a room.

<b>          INT. ROOM
</b>
          Dark. No windows. No furniture. Filled with cardboard
          boxes and wooden crates.
          Rand crinkles his nose. It su,Qlls bad in here.
          The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb. He leads the
          nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room.
          The Oriental picks up a small, metal box. A HIGH PITCHED
          GIGGLE echoes from inside the box.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>          Rand is very puzzled.
          The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates. He opens
          the box.
          A TINY CREATURE is inside'.
          The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on
          two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered
          hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The
          piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed.
          A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small,
          square teeth.
          The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle.
          Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything
          like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney
          character.
          The Oriental claps his hands.
          The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder.
          The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the
          creature.
          The Oriental claps his hands again.
          The creature hops back into the box. It stares at Rand
          with those cute green eyes'.

<b>          RAND
</b>          (to the Oriental)
          What is it?

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          It is called ' Mogwai ' .
          (a beat)
          A very rare and intelligent animal.
          I found it in the fields near my
          home It will obey all orders.
          It learns fast.
          The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands.

</b>
<b>          4
</b>          --Mogwai leaps to the ground. It scurries across the floor,
          to a wooden crate.
          Mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate. It tears off a
          chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man..
          He takes the fish. Mogwai hops back into the box.
          Rand shakes his head. Amazed by the animal.
          he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish. Juice runs
          own his chin. He smiles at Rand.

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          And if you are ever in need of
          a song...
          He claps his hands to the creature.

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN.
</b>          (Chinese; English

<b>          SUBTITLES)
</b>          Music.
          Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto. It's
          beautiful.
          Rand watches with wide eyes. He feels like a child again.

<b>          RAND -
</b>          How much?

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          One hundred American Dollars.
          Cash.
          Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives
          them to the man.
          The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps
          onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute
          giggle.

<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          It never sleeps. It will eat any-
          thing... but prefers raw meat.

<b>          (PAUSE)
</b>          It must always be kept indoors during
          the day. It lives in shadow. It
          hates bright light. Direct sunlight
          will kill it.
          Rand nods. He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it
          into the box. Rand puts the box under his arm. The
          Oriental smiles

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          ORIENTAL MAN
</b>          Your son will enjoy his new friend.
          Rand smiles and exits. The Oriental takes a bite from
          his raw fish.

</b>
          Rand is on the pay telephon His baggage rests beside
          him.
          Mogwai is inside of a small plastic pet box. The creature's
          bright eyes shine from inside.

<b>          RAND
</b>          (into the phone)
          Yes, Fred. The Tai-Chan account
          is definite. MmmHmm. My plane
          l eaves in twenty minutes. See
          you in Pennsylvania.
          He hangs up. He picks up his bags and walks to the check-
          in counter.

<b>          THE CHECK-IN GIRL
</b>          tags Mogwai's box and puts it on the conveyer belt.
          Rand watches the box disappear through the baggage chute.

<b>          CHECK-IN GIRL
</b>          Don't worry, sir. Your pet will
          be safe.
          Rand smiles.

          Rand is eating his airline dinner. AN ORIENTAL STEWARDESS
          walks up and refills his coffee. He looks at her.
          with the word 'Mogwai'?

          She moves to the next passenger.

</b>          Billy is 26 years old. His sturdy build and good looks are
          buried beneath wire rimmed glasses, slicked dirty-blonde
          .hair, a red sweater vest, a loose fitting checkered shirt,
          baggy corduroys and worn loafers.
          râ€¢ Finishing the transaction with his customer, Billy looks to

</b>          Next.

<b>          MRS. DEAGLE
</b>          an elderly woman, walks to Billy's window. She's a real
          prude. Tight lips. Heavy make-up. Bleached hair. Cheap
          fur coat. She hands Billy a personal check.

          Tracy counts out some cash to a customer. She's trying

          cult when

</b>          the bank security guard, is trying to make her laugh. He
          stands by the bank entrance, making funny faces at Tracy.

           thick hair. Deep brown eyes. Muscular. A strong, handsome
          face.
          Meanwhile, Billy gives the check back to Mrs. Deagle.

          Billy rubs his eyes. Tense. Embarrassed.
          Everyone watches the scene. Tracy. Gary. The customers.

<b>          ROLAND FRESCO
</b>          the bank's Vice President, walks over to Billy and Mrs.

</b>
<b>          (COMFORTING)
</b>          Now,-Mrs. Deagle...I'm sure this

          The woman shrugs.' Roland turns to Billy.

<b>          ROLAND
</b>          Apologize to the woman, Billy.
          Billy leans to Roland.

          Billy looks at her. He doesn'-t want to do this.
          Everyone in the bank is watching him, waiting for him
          to take a stand.
          Billy sighs. He needs his job.

          Roland walks back to his office with Mrs. Deagle.
          Gary chuckles. Tracy goes back to work.
          Billy just sits. Angry. Humiliated. He calls the next

          C'mon. Let's go.
          Tracy gives a wave to Billy. She and Gary walk away.
          Billy watches. He draws an imaginary sword from his side.
          He lifts the sword and lunges forward. At Gary.
          Billy sits at a table. Alone. He's reading his book. He
          eats, but his wide eyes never leave the page. He's fas-
          cinated by the story. Like a child. He gets to a funny
          section.. He laughs.

          Lynn pokes her head inside, looking around.
          Everything looks fine. Calm.
          She sighs. Relieved.

<b>          SUDDENLY
</b>          Something leaps out and grabs Lynn by the throat.
          A creature. We can't see it clearly. - It moves too fast.
          It is hiddenby the shadows.
          Other dark figures come at Lynn. More creatures. They
          want their share of the food.
          Lynn watches in horror as the creatures surround her head.
          She screams.

          Lynn's body jumps and twists. Her feet kick as she is
          pulled up into the attic.
          There are a few seconds of silence.
          Then we hear the sounds.
          Chewing. Swallowing. Giggling.

          Shaking'. Nervous. Billy climbs the stairs.

          Mogwai has changed.
          It stands two feet tall.
          The brown fur is gone, replaced by rock hard, rippled armor.
          The arms and legs are muscular, covered with the same armor.
          The paws have been replaced by claws. The fingernails are
          sharp.
          The tail is long and pointed. Reptilian. It thrashes
          back and forth.
          Sharp white horns have replaced the ears.
          The green eyes are larger. They bulge. Evil. Angry.
          A:huge mouth distorts the face with its wide grin. The
          countless teeth are long and sharp. Gleaming white. Fresh
          blood drips from them.

          He notices the cocoons. All hatched.
          Sounds echo from downstairs. Thumps. Giggles.

          Billy slams his blade 'nto Mogwai. He whacks the creature.
          Again and again.
          Finally, Mogwai falls to the floor.
          Billy brings down his blade. Hard.

          He walks by the fireplace.
          Three large RED VELVET STOCKINGS hang from the mantle.
          Each one is inscribed with a name: BILLY, RAND and LYNN.

          Two creatures leap at him.
          He spears one in mid-air.
          He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the
          ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists
          the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood.
          The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg.
          It takes a bite from his calf.
          Billy cries out in pair.
          Mogwai stays on. Biting hard.
          Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace.
          Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go.
          Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring
          flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to
          a crisp.
          Billy removes his steaming sword.
          The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead.

          One has crawled into the large blender. It laps up the

          The other sits on the table. It nibbles on the Santa cookies.
          Billy looks at the bl!ende1r. It's' unplugged.
          Billy moves quickly. He dashes across the room and plugs

          The startled creature spins inside.. Mogwai's screams
          die as it is chopped into a green mush.
          The remaining creature growls at Billy.
          Billy lunges forward with his sword.
          Mogwai leaps out of the way, onto the kitchen cabinet.
          Billy turns to the creature.
          Mogwai stands in front of the open microwave oven.

          Billy and Tracy start to climb up the ladder.

          Both creatures lie in the snow. Dead.
          Billy turns to the last Mogwai. With two swings of his
          blade, he kills the creature.
          Billy wipes the green blood off his sword with his coat
          sleeve. Breathless, he looks at Tracy .
          Hair .hangs in his eyes. Blood runs down the side of his.
          sweaty, unshaven face. His dark brown eyes stare at Tracy.

<b>          CLOSE-UP:
</b>
<b>          THE RED METAL TOOL BOX.
</b>          Still locked. Still sitting on the Greenhouse table,
          where Billy left it.

<b>          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL
</b>          SEVERAL WORKERS cleaning up the debris, repairing the
          broken Greenhouse windows.
          The workers load the trash onto a dump truck.
          Outside, the snow is melting. The sun shines bright.

<b>          A BURLY, MUSCULAR WORKER
</b>          walks up to the table and picks up the tool box. He shouts
          to another worker.

<b>          ANOTHER WORKER
</b>          Throw it out. â€¢ .with the
          other trash.
          The worker is ready to throw it out. He examines the tool
          box. Fairly new. In good condition. He decides to
          keep it.
          He walks to his van -and rests the tool box on the front
          passenger seat.

<b>          THE WORKER
</b>          driving home in his van. Later that afternoon. The radio
          plays a Country tune.

<b>          THE TOOL BOX
</b>          rests on the seat beside him.

<b>          SUDDENLY
</b>          the tool box begins to shake. Something pounds against it
          from inside.

<b>          THE WORKER
</b>          pulls his van to the roadside. He stares at the shaking
          tool box. His eyes are wide. Scared.
          The worker grabs the tool box. He gets out of his van.

<b>          OUTSIDE
</b>          The tool box shakes and rattles in the worker's hand.
          Frightened, he throws the box-over a hilly, wooded area
          at the side of the road.

<b>          THE TOOL BOX
</b>          tumbles down a steep hill.
          It lands at the bottom and bounces into a

<b>          LAKE
</b>          The tool box stays afloat for a few seconds. Then it
          slowly sinks into the lake water.

<b>          INT. WATER

          The tool box sinks to the bottom of the lake.
