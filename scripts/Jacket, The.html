</b>               A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and
               feeling like the heavens are supposed to.

<b>               
</b>               After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen
               and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest
               this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is
               tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead
               man.

</b>                           I was 25 years old the first time I
                           died...

<b>               
</b>               One more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from
               William Starks' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him
               as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured
               soldiers.

<b>               
</b>               Our glimpse of STARKS reveals a red stretcher -- soaked in blood --
               and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull.

<b>               
</b>               Then, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled
               sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does
               the pace of the world around him.

                           though there was war around me. And I
                           felt alive, even though I knew I was

               enter the frame and pull the TRIGGER on a gun. The sound

</b>               STARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily
               BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V.'s and dressings -- as a
               MAJOR, a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before --
               is alert, and striking. Even with the bandages, he remains
               well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would
               have been the only way for an enemy to take him down.

                           little more to the right and it
                           wouldn't have wanted to come out...

                           could have retrograde amnesia
                           or... [lowering his voice] any form of
                           psychological suppression. It's very
                           common with traumas like this.

<b>               
</b>               When he speaks, STARKS maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a
               man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his
               surroundings.

               blowing the SMOKE upwards and following it with his eyes.

<b>               
</b>               There are three KEY WITNESSES called to the stand: CAPTAIN
               MEDLEY, Starks' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf; DR.
               HALE, a psychiatrist; and OFFICER NASH, the cop who first
               came upon the crime scene. Their three testimonies are
               intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and
               confusingly -- just like it appears to himself.

</b>                           William Starks could be blocking the
                           incident. It would explain his well-
                           systematized scheme about the little
                           girl and her mother. A delusion as
                           complex as that can often replace the
                           reality of an incident like this.

<b>               
</b>               The first face STARKS sees as the world comes into focus is
               NURSE HARDING'S. Around it loom those of DR. BECKER, DR.
               GRIES and DAMON.

<b>               
</b>               A shot of the room shows a constraint-ridden apparatus
               hanging sternly on the wall. It is THE JACKET: an apparatus
               designed to encase a man's body. Made of coarse, sickly-
               stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would
               first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped
               around, the JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests
               its purpose: to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying
               nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement.
               Even under the tranquilizers, STARKS formidably resists them
               as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him in. Then Starks,
               sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to
               him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     STARKS
</b>                           Wait. Wait a minute... Please.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER motions for them to stop with his hand. STARKS blinks,
               trying to bring the faces above him into focus...

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     STARKS
</b>                           I, I don't belong here.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER looks into Starks' eyes. Sanity stares back.

<b>                                     BECKER

                           [Beat] But neither of us can do
                           anything about that.
               BECKER barely nods and STARKS is trussed in the JACKET with
               METAL CLAMPS. BECKER writes some details down, presumably
               about Starks' treatment.

<b>               
</b>               A CADAVER DRAWER -- just barely deep enough for a body or tall
               enough for the height of a nose -- is slid open and STARKS,
               already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET, is crammed inside.

<b>               
</b>               The ORDERLIES slam the cadaver drawer into the wall.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS is literally entombed alive. Silence. Stolen breath.
               They bolt the drawer and the CLANG echoes through his body.
               The BLACKNESS and CLOSENESS of the space choke him as his
               heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle.

               who's losing it -- hyperventilating, suffocating... for all
               intents and purposes, dying the worst kind of a death.

<b>               
</b>               Combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of what's
               happening to him, STARKS sees a single white DOT -- almost
               like a fleck of dust -- flitting between undecided SHAPES in
               the blackness until, slowly, it grows bigger and bigger...

<b>               
</b>               It's now a PATTERN of WHITE DOTS that changes the more STARKS
               stares at it. Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with
               formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to discern
               before they change into something else. Only after STARKS
               blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is SNOW
               from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in
               the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time
               between BLINKS.

<b>

                spilling from...

<b>               
</b>                2) OFFICER HARRISON'S mouth just seconds before his last
                breath. His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a FLASH...

<b>               
</b>                 3) From the barrel of a GUN fired near him.

<b>               
</b>               BLOOD sprays STARKS' hands as he looks down at them and
               realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it. He looks
               up from his hands and sees in similar flashes...

<b>               
</b>                1) The snow beneath the BLOOD changing to DIRT as STARKS
                stares at it. This time, the little river of RED comes
                from...

<b>               
</b>                 2) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers, all still except one...

<b>               
</b>                3) That of a IRAQI WOMAN. She unflinchingly lays her
                hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its
                blood on her face just before she lies back down among
                the dead, content to be one of them.

<b>               
</b>               The only SOUNDS during these dreadful images have been a
               trapped man's anxious BREATHS and the BEATS of a HEART
               pumping so fast it could be a drum...

<b>

               shut.

               something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the
               drawer. PING! Right on his eye. The drop of WATER is enough
               to send this man right over the edge.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS sees JACKIE, 8, sitting by a window in the diner. She
               turns her head towards the ENTRANCE and, as she looks there,
               so does Starks. That is when he first lays eyes on a woman, a
               WAITRESS -- worn but still lovely -- leaving the diner. He is
               taken with her and, for the first time since he's been in the
               Jacket, seems calm. Just then, however, the reverie is
               shattered...

</b>               STARKS sits, totally disoriented, in the ward with the other,
               more vocally INSANE patients. He runs his hand uncertainly
               over the SCARS on his arm from the Jacket and looks around --

                           make you seem crazy.

</b>                           Or just plain stupid. You'd think by
                           the twentieth time, I'd have found an
                           alternative method. Maybe a more
                           effective one, if you know what I
                           mean.

</b>                           Morning, gentlemen. How are you doing
                           today?

<b>               
</b>               MACKENZIE winks discreetly at STARKS before he replies.

<b>                                     MACKENZIE
</b>                           It's a hard one for me, Dr. Lorenson.
                           [Finally turns to face her, grimly]
                           The world around me, it's shrinking.
                           There's not even room for light to
                           make its way in. [Beat] Da-da-bum! Da-
                           da-bum! I feel like the horseman of
                           doom is coming for me, Doc. Only
                           today, he's not carrying flowers.

<b>               
</b>               LORENSON reprimands MacKenzie by turning to Starks.

<b>

<b>                                     MACKENZIE

                           I'm fine.

</b>
<b>                                     DR. LORENSON
</b>                           Mr. MacKenzie, do you think I could
                           talk to Mr. Starks privately?

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     MACKENZIE
</b>                           Of course you can, Doc. William, it
                           was an absolute pleasure. Thanks for
                           playing.

<b>               
</b>               Just before he walks away, MACKENZIE turns around nervously
               and uncharacteristically looks STARKS right in the eye.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                                                             21.

                           woods tonight and invite the wolves,
                           dance with them. [Beat] They don't
                           eat you when there's music playing.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS looks at MacKenzie briskly, wondering if his words
               were directed or just the meandering of a nut. But MacKenzie
               just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away --
               dead arm in tow.

<b>

<b>                                     DR. LORENSON

<b>                                     DR. LORENSON
</b>                           I asked you if you're ok.

<b>               
</b>                                     STARKS [Suspiciously]
                           I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You
                           think there's anything wrong with me?

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     DR. LORENSON
</b>                           I don't know. You're not my patient.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS looks away. Lorenson gives him a once over.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     DR. LORENSON
</b>                           You look like you've lost some
                           weight. Are you eating?

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     STARKS
</b>                           I am. One of the few things I
                           remember doing is eating. So I guess
                           I must be exercising it off in my
                           dreams.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS looks at LORENSON, seeing if he'll respond. LORENSON
               looks back curiously at STARKS' pointed stare.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     STARKS

</b>                           Good.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY -- a fact that doesn't
               escape LORENSON's observation.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                                                              22.

</b>

<b>               
</b>               STARKS walks into the bathroom, keenly eyeing the thin slit
               of WINDOWS at the top of the wall. He walks closer to them,
               when he suddenly hears some STRAINED BREATHING from inside
               one of the stalls. He checks the first stall, pushing it
               open. It swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock.

<b>               
</b>               The sound continues. STARKS walks slowly past the second
               stall to the third and then... WHACK! The door swings all the
               way towards STARKS. BRUTALLY. He falls backwards -- his head
               just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink.

<b>               
</b>               DAMON, the ORDERLY, walks out.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     DAMON
</b>                           I'm sorry, Starks. Must have not seen
                           you coming there.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS writhes in PAIN -- straining for his own breath now.

<b>               
</b>                                     DAMON [Leaning down close to him]
                           Were you worried about me? [Smiling]
                           That's so sweet. Thanks.

<b>               
</b>               With that, DAMON walks out, leaving STARKS on the floor.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS sits in his room, listening to the silence of the
               night interrupted by first faint, then approaching,
               FOOTSTEPS. Closer and closer...then harmfully near until
               DAMON and HARDING enter his room.

<b>               
</b>               They pause -- awaiting a reaction. STARKS doesn't give them
               one.

<b>                                     NURSE HARDING

<b>               
</b>               STARKS walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own
               torture -- flanked by HARDING and DAMON on either side.

<b>               
</b>
<b>               INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE
</b>

<b>               
</b>               They're all in the room. STARKS seems pretty calm. Only in a
               C.U. do we see his eyes register the JACKET...

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     BECKER
</b>                           I'm glad to see you're cooperating
                           this time, Mr. Starks.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                                                              23.
</b>
<b>               
</b>               STARKS looks at the WIDE, STURDY restraints on it. They would
               really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with
               them. They might even knock someone out...

<b>               
</b>               DAMON and HARDING move to undress him, when STARKS makes a
               move to do it himself. They look to DR. BECKER who NODS that
               it's all right.

<b>               
</b>               DAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps
               on one of Starks' bare feet.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS doesn't flinch. He merely turns away from them and
               bends down to take off his pants. On his way up, he GRABS THE
               JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and, using it like a weapon, aims to
               smack it across Damon's face. DAMON deftly ducks and the
               JACKET hits BECKER instead. The force of the blow sends
               Becker down, and as he falls against the wall, DAMON and
               HARDING leap to restrain Starks.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER   opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into
               focus.   His right cheek is cut pretty bad. DR. GRIES helps
               BECKER   to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up off the
               floor.   BECKER puts them on.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                       DR. GRIES
</b>                             Hold him while I get the
                             tranquilizer.

<b>               
</b>               DAMON KICKS Starks hard in the back, nearly sending him down.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                       BECKER
</b>                             No. That's not necessary.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER looks down and sees his own BLOOD fall on the floor.
               He looks up at STARKS who, even in his pain, looks shocked at
               the force he just used.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                       BECKER
</b>                             Let him go. [More firmly] I said, let
                             him go!

<b>               
</b>               As soon as they let him go, STARKS lunges for BECKER --
               pushing him up against the wall. STARKS stops, presumably
               about to harm Becker but unsure, even to himself, of what
               he's capable of doing...

<b>               
</b>               BECKER looks fearlessly into Starks' eyes.

<b>

<b>                                                                              24.

<b>

                            What, Starks? What are you going to
                            do? End me just because I'm an
                            inconvenience to you? [Beat] Just
                            like you did with Officer Harrison?

<b>               
</b>               STARKS' face registers the meaning in Becker's words and a
               look of self-doubt crosses his face.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS lets go of him and, as soon as he does, DAMON and
               HARDING restrain him. BECKER calmly wipes the BLOOD from his
               face, looks at his hand, shakes his head and walks out.

               is BANDAGED. He opens a drawer, takes out some SCOTCH and
               pours himself a SHOT. He swallows some pills with it.

</b>               STARKS finds himself in the physically wrenching place once
               more. But nothing happens for some seconds. He breathes
               anxiously, not knowing what to expect. His heart beats
               steadily: THUMP...THUMP, until, finally, with each beat, a
               SMALL WHITE FLECK becomes two flecks...then, two
               dots...then, two circles...then, the WHITES of a pair of
               EYES with a terrific meanness in them.

<b>               
</b>               The EYES blink, then disappear like they were never there.

<b>

               documentation of the action -- the ruin -- as it's occurring.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the IMAGES.
               They move like they're liquid and, when they settle, the
               whole wall is replaced with one large IMAGE of a BEAUTIFUL
               WOMAN -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a COFFEE

               of the moment with this simple gesture.

</b>               The WAITRESS (early 20s) -- tired, with kind eyes, soft skin
               and a beautiful mouth that hasn't smiled in a long time --
               emerges from the diner. Even with no effort, she is
               remarkably pretty.

<b>               
</b>               From her UNIFORM, we know that her day was spent there.
               STARKS simply stares at this WOMAN who seems markedly removed
               from the world around her. The only fact she wears on her is
               that she's tired.

<b>               
</b>               She spots STARKS and can't help but do a double-take. Both

               there.

</b>               After a few hundred yards, she SLAMS on the brakes and turns
               the car round, coming back. Then she jumps out of the car and
               heads back in the diner, without looking over at STARKS.

</b>               STARKS nods slowly. The WAITRESS gets in her car and looks
               again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR. He has hardly any
               winter gear on him -- no gloves, no hat, no coat -- just jeans
               and a flannel. He looks lost among his surroundings, as much
               because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't
               look like he belongs there.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS rubs his hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks it
               over. She watches him curiously.

<b>               
</b>               The WAITRESS takes out a FLASK and a sizable SWIG from it;
               she swallows it smoothly, like someone used to doing so.

<b>

<b>                                     WAITRESS

</b>
<b>                                     WAITRESS

</b>                           Because in my life, it wouldn't make
                           sense for me to pick up some normal
                           guy with a place where he's from and
                           a place where he's going to. It'd be
                           too simple. I probably wouldn't know
                           how to handle a situation like that.

                           normal or simple this time either.

<b>               
</b>               She looks over at him -- momentarily suspicious. He looks back
               innocuously; there's something innately safe about him.

                           kind of start.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS sees her take another DRINK from the flask. She pulls
               out a CIGARETTE, and STARKS lights it for her with some

<b>               
</b>               She laughs, noticeably more relaxed now after the drink.

<b>               
</b>               She casts a long sideward glance at STARKS, taking him and
               her circumstances in for herself. He looks back gently.

</b>               She is on the PHONE, calling various shelters.   Her apartment
               has some pieces of mismatched furniture, along   with a string
               of lopsided CHRISTMAS LIGHTS strewn around the   WINDOWS in the
               room. They, more than anything else, light the   place.

<b>

                           out there. You don't even have a

                           there and then I'll have to feel
                           guilty. And I've already got more
                           guilt than I know what to do with.
                           [Beat] Do you want something to

<b>               
</b>               She leaves to the KITCHEN to fix herself a drink and STARKS
               stares after her. Suddenly, a SMASHING SOUND is heard as
               something falls in the kitchen. STARKS' whole BODY TENSES UP
               as he wonders whether he's being taken out of the Jacket.

</b>               As she presumably cleans it up, we stay on STARKS who slowly
               gains hold of himself. She comes back, DRINK in hand and
               pushes the STRAND OF HAIR in her face back the same way she
               did when he saw her in the tunnel. Even through her
               weariness, she looks radiant under the Christmas lights. She
               takes a long SIP.

                           something anyway. And don't snoop,

               given to Jackie, only a couple weeks ago, hanging from a
               single NAIL tacked into the wall.

<b>               
</b>               Stunned, he stares at his NAME and BIRTH DATE scored on the
               metal. He looks back at the WAITRESS and then to the few
               PICTURES on the mantle: they are of JACKIE and her mother,
               JEAN. STARKS runs his hand through his hair, trying to
               swallow the improbability, and inexplicability, of the
               situation.
               STARKS' EYES search the room for ANYTHING that could help him
               figure out what's happening. On the console is an OLD PAPER
               and some MAIL. Totally disoriented, STARKS nearly STUMBLES on
               his way to the PILE.

<b>               
</b>               The label on the first BILL reads "Jackie Price." On the
               second, the same. And the third...until at the bottom of the
               pile, STARKS spots an OLD NEWSPAPER with the answer on its
               DATE: December 3, 2004.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS is absolutely stunned.
               STARKS looks over at JACKIE and, just then, the HARSH SOUND
               of the DRAWER being opened rings deafeningly in his ears and
               the image of her starts to DISSOLVE at this worst moment. He
               is being taken out of the JACKET...

<b>               
</b>               It's DR. GRIES, racked with guilt, who pulls Starks out...

<b>               
</b>               He winces at the sight of the BLOOD and SWEAT streaked across
               Starks' face. DR. GRIES checks his pulse and cleans his face
               as best as he can with a WET TOWEL.

<b>               
</b>               His VOICE echoes in the morgue, sounding to Starks, as it
               does to us, faint and distant. DR. GRIES drips some WATER in
               Starks' mouth. As some of it trickles out, it runs into the
               JACKET, burning STARKS' chafed skin.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS' EYES flutter and DR. GRIES pushes the drawer back in,
               afraid of what they've done to this man...

</b>               She puts her face under the WATER and lets it restore some

</b>               JACKIE spots STARKS asleep on the couch -- newspaper strewn
               all around him and the TV still on. He's holding the TAGS.

</b>               She kneels down close to his face and stares at him for
               awhile before STARKS is jarred. He defensively GRABS HER
               WRIST as his EYES BURST OPEN, startling her.

                           believe in many things, but I believe
                           in death. And it doesn't give back

</b>               STARKS looks around him and, we see, from bottom up, the
               exterior around Jackie's house melt away as STARKS suddenly
               faces the massacred village in Iraq. Shocked at what's
               happening to his body, he looks up, petrified. His body is
               wound as tightly as a knot.

</b>               Again, we're glimpsing the scene through PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN
               NIGHT VISION intermittently negotiated with real-time images.

<b>               
</b>               Opposite Starks stands a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER -- seething in
               anger and pointing his gun at a LITTLE BOY, presumably
               belonging to the MAN not five feet away. Next to Starks is an
               angry CAPTAIN MEDLEY, ordering STARKS to follow him. STARKS
               is watching himself in the scene.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS turns and aims his gun at a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER
               threatening to shoot a child. We hear him YELLING in Arabic.

<b>               
</b>               What STARKS doesn't see is another IRAQI SOLDIER (2) aiming
               his GUN at STARKS.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS doesn't hear him; he's busy perfecting his aim.

<b>               
</b>               At the force of the word, the SOLDIER lowers his gun and the
               LITTLE BOY flees.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS, who is now in the scene himself, lowers his gun
               slightly as he approaches the SOLDIER. Neither speaks the
               other's language but they're both saying everything with
               their eyes. Neither moves his off the other.

<b>               
</b>               Just then, though, we see the SECOND IRAQI SOLDIER get a
               clear aim at STARKS.

</b>
<b>               
</b>               He takes his SHOT before anyone else does. STARKS goes down
               as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off.

<b>               
</b>               He falls to the ground. As the rest of the picture fades to
               black, all that is left is previously mysterious, still
               haunting PAIR of EYES that we now see belonged to the

<b>               CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER.

<b>

                           going to "happen" to Starks. I don't

<b>               
</b>               STARKS is asleep when a DARK FIGURE walks, like a GHOST, past
               the WINDOWED DOOR of his room. STARKS opens his eyes and
               snaps his neck in its direction -- fearful of everything at
               this point. When he looks, there's nothing there; he's not
               sure there ever was. The room starts to blue as he looks
               around it, not knowing if he is crazy...

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE peruses HEADLINES and ABSTRACTS pulled up on the web:

<b>               
</b>                   "ALPINE GROVE INVESTIGATION into the mysterious death of
                   William Starks..."

<b>               
</b>                   "The body of WILLIAM STARKS, the former war hero who was
                   charged with the murder of OFFICER EDWARD HARRISON, was
                   found on the grounds of ALPINE GROVE on January 1, 1993.
                   STARKS was believed to have died from a wound to the
                   head."

<b>               
</b>               The words and PHRASES that confirm Starks' story RISE from
               their couched places on the computer screen.

<b>               
</b>                   "Local Doctor charged with medical malpractice." "Dr.
                   Thomas Becker resigns..." "It involved the recreation of
                   a womb-like environment." "Former patients testify to
                   being put in instrument known as the 'Jacket'"...

<b>

<b>               
</b>               As JACKIE keeps scrolling, her face wears her disbelief that
               what STARKS was saying may have been true. Then, she sees,
               archived in a state newspaper, a mention of Dr. Lorenson and
               a particular patient, "Eugene Yazdi."

<b>

</b>

<b>               
</b>               A NURSE is checking on STARKS as he slowly wakes up.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                      STARKS
</b>                            What the hell kind of drugs are you
                            people giving me?

</b>
<b>               
</b>               STARKS is asking the NURSE, but it's BECKER's voice that
               answers though Starks can't see him.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                      BECKER [O.S.]
</b>                            Just something to help you sleep.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS panics when he hears the voice. He looks around
               nervously but the BRIGHT SUNLIGHT pouring into the room is
               blinding. He swallows as he looks at the NURSE'S FACE as she
               continues adjusting his pillows.

<b>               
</b>                                      STARKS [Swallowing nervously]
                            Did you say something?

<b>               
</b>               The NURSE shakes her head lightly and just then BECKER steps
               out of the LIGHT.

<b>                                      BECKER
</b>                            I said the drugs were to help you
                            sleep. [Beat] Did you sleep well?

<b>               
</b>               Becker is remarkably calm, further confusing Starks' sense of
               reality.

<b>               
</b>                                      STARKS [Doubtfully]
                            But I wasn't asleep. Was I?

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                      BECKER
</b>                            Yes. You were. You were asleep for
                            nearly a whole day. It's December
                            26th, William.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS sits up groggily, remembering what happened to him and
               wondering how much, if any of it, was real.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     STARKS

<b>               
</b>               STARKS examines himself -- looking at his arms, spotting the
               BRUISES on them.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                      BECKER
</b>                            That's right, William.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER nods. STARKS sits up -- his predicament and the room
               slowly coming into focus.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                                                              52.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS begins to piece if together. BECKER, as we begin to
               see, is right. It is 1992 in Alpine Grove.

<b>

<b>                                     STARKS

                           that you left me in there.

                           Jacket.

<b>               
</b>               The NURSE gives Becker a knowing look -- suggesting Starks
               really is delusional. Becker doesn't even flinch as STARKS
               tries to get a better look at Becker's face.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     BECKER
</b>                           We were forced to use restrains if
                           that's what you're referring to.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     STARKS
</b>                           That wasn't a fucking restraint.

<b>

<b>                                     BECKER
</b>                           Actually, that's exactly what our
                           equipment is.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS' EYES widen with alarm as BECKER reaches for the I.V.
               in his arm, lingering on it long enough that Starks braces
               himself for an ATTACK of some sort. But Becker just looks
               back innocently as he adjusts it.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                       BECKER

<b>               
</b>               Then he clarifies, wryly enough for Starks to catch it.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                                                              53.

                           something and stuck me in a drawer.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER nods diagnostically. The NURSE's nonchalance about it
               as she LEAVES the room further disquiets STARKS.

<b>               
</b>

                           asleep but it wasn't a dream.
               BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.

</b>                           Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year
                           old girl. [Beat] His lawyers asked me
                           to have a look at him because, after
                           his deeds were done... he climbed
                           into the trees of the forest where he
                           killed her and woofed like a dog. He
                           couldn't even remember his name when
                           I spoke to him, but, curiously
                           enough, he could speak back. [Beat]
                           Ted never went to prison because
                           everyone -- including me -- was
                           convinced he was sick. So he came
                           here.

                           her mother to visit a relative and I
                           caught Ted stealing looks at her --
                           the kind you really have to steal if
                           you know what I mean. [Beat] I asked
                           Ted then if he could remember what
                           the little girl who he had... slain
                           ...was wearing. [Beat] He gave me a
                           look I'll never forget, and, when he
                           answered, it wasn't with a color or
                           any sort of physical description I'd
                           expect. "Oh yes," he said. "I remember
                           it. I remember it well." [Beat] Those
                           were actually his last words I think.

</b>
<b>                                      MACKENZIE

<b>

                            be familiar with. It means you're

<b>               
</b>               MACKENZIE grows visibly more nervous at this second mention

<b>               
</b>               Just then, NURSE HARDING is upon them. She carries a ROD in
               her hand which she TAPS menacingly on the floor as she walks
               towards them.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS tenses up as he sees only the ROD, which could inflict
               a GASH if hit across a man's head the right way. Nearly every
               object could be a threat to his life as this point.

</b>                                     MACKENZIE [Spoken like a nut]
                           [Beat] We're talking about our
                           ability to go forward in time, to go
                           into the future. [To Starks] That is
                           what we're talking about here, right?

<b>

                           think we're doing in this place?

<b>               
</b>               MACKENZIE tries not to laugh but a CHUCKLE slips out.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     HARDING

<b>               
</b>               HARDING walks away with a final stare that Starks returns.

<b>               
</b>                                     STARKS [Under his breath]

<b>               
</b>               MACKENZIE's body betrays his discomfort talking about it in
               its sudden jerks accompanying every word.

                           now. When she started getting

                           this annual review and just cut our
                           budget. Our silence on the matter
                           should be enough to appease the civic
                           conscience without wasting an hour we

<b>               
</b>               LORENSON looks at GRIES askance before she sets the record
               straight.

                           ...they might care about what we're

<b>               INT. WARD 3, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY
</b>

<b>               
</b>               STARKS is in a different ward with PATIENTS who appear more
               threatening and disturbed. As he is anxiously looking around --
               presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the PATIENTS
               humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY. Looking to see who it
               comes from, STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a young,
               fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE, SALLY,
               administering medication from a dated CART.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS
               or ORDERLIES around. The YOUNG NURSE, meanwhile, is focused
               on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her.

<b>               
</b>               The BRUTE's not that far away when he starts walking towards
               the YOUNG NURSE. STARKS starts in their direction, picking up
               speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS -- as
               the BRUTE reaches the NURSE.

<b>               
</b>               He throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL. She
               starts screaming as he pushes up against her. STARKS picks up
               the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it.

<b>               
</b>               The BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his
               balance. It's clear he's impaired. But it's also clear he
               understands pain.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                                                             62.

<b>

                            You ok?

<b>               
</b>               As she NODS, her EYES dart above to the HAND about to strike
               him. Off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the
               BRUTE in the stomach -- HARD -- but not before the piece of GLASS
               he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes
               perilously close to STARKS' head.

<b>               
</b>               The BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified.
               Is this when he dies?

<b>               
</b>               The BRUTE -- incensed more than ever -- lunges at him a final time.
               STARKS gets him by the NECK, expertly applying PRESSURE
               POINTS and, after only a few seconds, subdues him. STARKS
               himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them. He lets
               out a suspended BREATH, instinctively touching his FOREHEAD
               to make sure he's not cut. He looks back at SALLY.

<b>

<b>                                     SALLY

               Her eyes shift to the BRUTE on the floor and she remembers
               that she can.

<b>               
</b>               The STATE REP -- 40s, disgruntled, even drowsy -- is
               recognizable among a group that includes the CHIEF OF STAFF
               (Dr. Williams), BECKER, LORENSON and GRIES. They are
               presiding over a GROUP THERAPY SESSION when STARKS enters...

<b>

<b>               
</b>               BECKER is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                      BECKER
</b>                            Mr. Starks, this session is for our
                            civil patients. Damon, please take
                            Mr. Starks back to his ward.
               STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze.

<b>               
</b>                                      STARKS [Derisively]
                            No. Please, Dr. Becker. You can strap
                            me in a Jacket or even gag me, but
                            please don't leave me out of therapy.
                            This is where I feel like I make the
                            most progress.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER relents, seeing STARKS has the upper hand -- an
               AUDIENCE, deranged but eager no less.

<b>

</b>                            Fine, Mr. Starks. You can pull up a
                            chair for yourself.

<b>               
</b>               As STARKS walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone -- as
               they turn their heads to watch him -- that he is a physically
               ailing man. Using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the
               group, dragging a CHAIR behind him because he doesn't have
               the strength to lift it. STARKS sits down.

<b>               
</b>               JENSEN -- a twitchy schizophrenic -- surveys the group
               seriously, determining whether it's safe to say what he's
               about to...

</b>               STARKS looks at JENSEN, who looks back avidly. MACKENZIE eyes
               Starks nervously, like he senses what he is about to do.

                           if it's not, it doesn't help Mr.

                            It is a fact. Bona fide, and
                            classified.

<b>

                           Doctors] know about it. In fact, when

                           of state leave office, they come
                           here, to Alpine Grove. They're among

                           picked you.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS suddenly turns right at Becker, wrapping his message
               to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut.

                           All they do is give orders. That's
                           all they have to do. And no one will
                           ever know. All it comes down to is an
                           order. [Beat] They've got hands
                           everywhere.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS stands up, ready to SALUTE Mr. Jensen. The OBSERVERS
               look to BECKER for order.

<b>               
</b>               But, at that, Jensen's completely lost it. His excitement
               erupts in the form of him JUMPING out of his chair and
               eagerly and elatedly HITTING HIMSELF in the head.

               up in the air. And, in the midst of the havoc, the speechless
               order is soundly delivered in Becker's NOD to Damon.

               notice them taking Starks out. STARKS winks at MACKENZIE, who

</b>               STARKS' eyes dart about him; it sounds like something is in
               there with him. The sound stops momentarily and, then, out of
               nowhere, a DROP falls on his eye. PING! STARKS winces. He
               clenches his face, not knowing when the next drop will fall.
               His heart starts to beat more and more madly, punctuated by
               the DRIPS -- making a score fit only for hell. He closes his

<b>                                     OFFICER HARRISON
</b>                           This is a stolen vehicle you're
                           driving. Now put your hands in the
                           air, out where I can see 'em.

<b>               
</b>               That's the second when OFFICER HARRISON sees where TENNY'S
               HAND is. As he reaches for his own GUN, the situation
               explodes as TWO FLASHES eclipse all else. OFFICER HARRISON
               goes down, still holding his own GUN and STARKS jumps out of
               the car to check on him.

<b>                                     STARKS

<b>               
</b>               TENNY looks around, still holding the GUN. Starks swallows,
               assessing whether to back away or not. TENNY waves his gun as
               he half points it in Harrison's direction. Then, GUN still in
               hand, he smirks nervously and looks at STARKS.

                           ain't even worth a fucking bullet.

<b>               
</b>               TENNY raises the gun, then aims it away from STARKS and
               shoots OFFICER HARRISON once more. From the ground, OFFICER
               HARRISON fires back and STARKS, now lunging at Tenny, TAKES

<b>               THE HIT.
</b>
<b>               
</b>               STARKS falls, clearly unable to get up, let alone pursue
               anyone. TENNY smiles sardonically and slowly puts the GUN in
               his back pocket as he turns to leave. This SMILE was one of
               the eerie FLASHES that haunted Starks in the JACKET...

<b>               
</b>               STARKS struggles but can't move. That's when he passes out,

               as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he's
               back in there. Then he sees an IMAGE of a WOMAN'S FOREHEAD

                           Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr.

                           the hospital. If she was here at the

                           doubt the hospital would have that,
                           if Dr. Becker is still even alive.
                           [Beat, a little suspiciously] Is
                           there a particular reason you need

<b>               
</b>               Dr. MORGAN leads JACKIE and STARKS through a ward. STARKS
               looks around in disbelief; it's more like a hospital now than
               it ever was in 1993.

<b>               
</b>               As they arrive outside Lorenson's office, MORGAN turns to
               them.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     DR. MORGAN
</b>                           Let me just tell her we're here.

<b>               
</b>               DR. MORGAN goes inside and JACKIE takes STARKS' HAND as they
               wait. It's hardly more than a couple seconds when LORENSON
               appears in the doorway. She looks at STARKS curiously and the
               two share a very lengthy, intense STARE.

<b>               
</b>               DR. LORENSON -- now in her 50s -- walks closer to Starks
               suspiciously. For his part, STARKS doesn't look as unfamiliar
               with Lorenson as he should; this doesn't escape Lorenson.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     LORENSON

<b>               
</b>               She puts out a hand that is trembling slightly.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     LORENSON
</b>                           It's nice to meet you, Mr. Starks...

<b>               
</b>               STARKS hesitates before he takes Lorenson's hand. There is
               something very eerie about the exchange. STARKS quickly lets
               go and LORENSON turns to JACKIE...

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     LORENSON

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE looks back uncomfortably.

</b>                           I'm just William's friend.

<b>               
</b>               LORENSON looks over both of them acutely and then calmly
               turns to Dr. Morgan.

<b>               
</b>

                           likely Becker does, but at the very
                           least she knows how I died.

                              true. You probably did help her
                              somehow with the boy and Eugene's
                              name did come up over and over again

</b>               STARKS, determined, now leads JACKIE. As they reach the end
               of the hall, we see DAMON -- now in his 50s -- look after them
               curiously before he goes back to his work with a PATIENT.

<b>               
</b>               The morgue looks exactly as before.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS is momentarily jarred in the room. He looks to the
               wall on which the JACKET hung and sees only the BARE HOOKS
               that used to hold it up.

<b>

                              the Jacket there. [Turning to Jackie]
                              This is where it happened. This is
                              the room I'm actually in right now.

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE isn't doubtful, but it's also hard to be
               convinced...

<b>               
</b>               STARKS walks to the CADAVER DRAWERS and rests his hands on
               the one they put him in. Then, with great difficulty --
               physical and emotional -- he opens it to see if there is
               anything left.

<b>               
</b>               He pulls it out, and there's nothing in there.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the
               stained metal -- still reddened and browned with DRIED BLOOD --
               and the part of the morgue slab he CLAWED his NAILS into when
               he was in it. JACKIE looks at it in disbelief.

                           Dead bodies don't bleed. And they
                           certainly can't claw so hard they

               DAMON, now hardly a hair of the bully he was before. DAMON
               stares at him curiously; STARKS glares back furiously.

</b>               STARKS is standing above his own headstone: WILLIAM STARKS,
               December 25, 1967 - January 1, 1993. Next to his grave is that
               of RUDY MACKENZIE. STARKS looks down sadly at both. JACKIE
               comes up behind him.

</b>               The sore sound of the DRAWER being opened stirs Jackie --
               awakening her as if she heard it in her sleep. She reaches
               across the bed, but STARKS is no longer there. She runs her

               observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes inside.

                            Everyone does it, don't they? Even
                            Becker. That roller coaster car pops
                            more pills than all of Ward 3.

</b>                           I've been here for 11 years. It's my

                           guess he has to be to put up with all

</b>               STARKS nods and MacKenzie puts his head down, suddenly
               vulnerable and embarrassed. STARKS lights TWO CIGARETTES.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS is trying to see if the windows open through the bars
               covering them. It's especially hard with the I.V. still
               connected to one of his arms.

                           I would've been here sooner but you
                           gave our little state visitor quite a
                           bit to talk to me about.

                           you just have to patient with them.
                           They'd rather have their vacation,
                           too, so they just push dealing with

<b>               
</b>               STARKS lights a cigarette and, with that gesture, adopts the
               unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears
               little resemblance to his usual demeanor.

                           get away with mine.

                           But I still want to make a deal.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER looks understandably disgusted and STARKS proceeds
               with the calculation of someone who is guilty.

<b>

<b>                                     STARKS
</b>                           See, the deluxe lab animal treatment
                           I've been receiving -- well, I don't
                           think it's worked. I woke up today
                           and realized... [eerily lowering his
                           voice] ...I don't think I'm cured. So
                           really, what was the point? Torture?
                           I think that's still sort of illegal
                           in some states -- though we'll have to
                           check on Vermont. And, how's this for
                           the cherry on top: it seems my
                           physician is a pill-popping freak.
                           [Beat] Last time I checked, that
                           makes some pretty good copy for a lot
                           of these news shows. [Humbly, deftly]
                           "I don't remember everything they did
                           to me. I just remember the worst
                           parts." I think I should be sitting
                           down when I say it, don't you think?

<b>               
</b>               It takes BECKER some seconds to swallow this.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     BECKER
</b>                           I think...I have to think about it.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER cocks his head to one side as he does. Then he slowly
               makes his way over to STARKS and leans in closer to him.
               STARKS instinctively raises his hand to his HEAD -- prepared
               to be defensive if he has to be. If this is the moment when
               he's killed.

<b>               
</b>               But BECKER only YANKS the I.V. angrily out of Starks' arm,
               tearing his skin with it.

<b>

<b>                                     BECKER

                           fleshing out before it's ready to go.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER turns to leave as STARKS bleeds onto the floor.

                           today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can
                           pick up where the medicine left off.

                           if we didn't at least try to.

</b>               DAMON hustles Starks down the hall as fast as they can before
               the NURSE or any other staff member spots them.

<b>               
</b>               EUGENE sits opposite LORENSON, who quietly observes him,
               jotting some notes down on her pad. She is intermittently
               holding up PICTURES for Eugene, asking him to repeat their
               names as if she were teaching him to read.

<b>                                     LORENSON
</b>                           Eugene, this is a "TRAIN."

<b>               
</b>               EUGENE starts to pronounce the word when abruptly, and
               without any warning, he looks like he's unconscious, only
               with a blank stare. Lorenson quickly moves beside Eugene and
               watches him from up close, apparently not altogether
               surprised at what's happening.

<b>               
</b>               EUGENE doesn't even blink. The only sounds we hear from him
               are a couple, barely audible guttural noises. LORENSON --
               exhausted -- takes off her glasses wearily and gently
               addresses the boy.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     LORENSON
</b>                           Come on back down here. Wherever you
                           are...try to come on back. You'll
                           like it, I promise.

<b>               
</b>               Just then, TALIA walks in with TEA, JUICE and COOKIES for
               Eugene and Lorenson. She spots her son in his absent, staring
               state and forces her face into a small, sad smile to avoid
               tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies before them.

<b>               
</b>               TALIA gently touches LORENSON'S hand. LORENSON looks at her
               warmly. TALIA knows how hard she's trying.

               strapping Starks in the Jacket.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS sits by himself in Jackie's car, parked in a gas
               station. He looks around, trying to make sure it really is
               her car. He looks in the back and sees a pair of sneakers and
               an empty BOTTLE of VODKA.

<b>               
</b>               He looks outside and sees a few people walking into the FOOD
               MART of the gas station. He trembles with cold as he looks
               down at his plaid shirt.
               Then, JACKIE unexpectedly appears outside the DRIVER'S WINDOW
               opening the car door and nearly spilling her COFFEE when she
               spots STARKS next to her.

</b>               She leans over to him and gives him a kiss, handing him the
               coffee.

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE sees the town seated in the Church. The PRIEST looks
               up at her briefly and some people turn around, but she closes
               the DOOR before she causes a major interruption.

<b>               
</b>               We move to the third or fourth row, where, from behind, we
               see a head of GREY HAIR. He slowly turns around, casting a
               look towards the door and revealing a glimpse of his face.
               Though it's aged slightly, it hasn't softened.

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE and STARKS watch as the people file out of Church.
               They are leaning against her car when STARKS spots him.

<b>               
</b>               DR. BECKER walks beside a SMALL CHILD -- presumably his
               GRANDSON. JACKIE registers his formidableness with some
               surprise; Becker's maintained a strong physique and is hardly
               a shade less intimidating than he was before. Only his hand
               has a permanent shake now.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS doesn't waste any time. He heads straight for him.
               Almost sensing him, BECKER looks in his direction. The casual
               look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of DISBELIEF.

<b>

<b>               
</b>               BECKER stops walking and looks at Starks. His GRANDSON looks
               at him.

<b>               
</b>               That's enough to confirm for BECKER who STARKS is.

<b>

</b>               STARKS looks at Becker -- each a terrifying reminder of the

                           probably helped push you to kill
                           yourself, but I didn't do it.

                           have to know.

<b>               
</b>               BECKER looks at him, nearly too stunned to speak.

                           time I put you in the Jacket was just
                           after you told me you remembered
                           killing that police officer...

                           possibly have known. You came back

               indicts himself.

</b>               And with those words, JACKIE starts to break down.

</b>               STARKS looks at her with love, understanding and, for the
               first time, a sense of peace. He strokes her hair to calm her
               down.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS looks at her without answering. JACKIE wipes her eyes,
               fastens STARKS' seat belt, and seeing that Starks' EYES have
               started to flutter, starts driving. In the distance, the
               barely audible sound of the DRAWER opening, and their time
               ending, is heard.

               she's looked up about Dr. Lorenson. The PAPER gets jammed,
               and that's when JACKIE completely loses it. She WRESTLES with

</b>               Then she realizes she's not alone. She looks back and sees
               CLAIRE, watching from the doorway, with a sympathetic look in
               her eyes.

</b>               STARKS is walking back on the same highway just after the sun
               has set, and just after he helped JEAN and JACKIE, on that
               fateful day...

<b>               
</b>               This time we see a CAR stop for him from a much closer
               distance. TENNY pulls up towards STARKS and rolls down the
               window on the passenger side. STARKS bends down to be able to
               see the driver.

</b>               She realizes he's gone. She RUSHES after him, opens the door
               in a fit, and then, sees what she feared most: no sign of
               Starks. JACKIE falls to her knees, right there, on the
               bathroom floor and cries out like a woman only beginning to
               realize how unfathomably deep her heart is...

</b>               BECKER is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly
               decides not to. He takes off his coat and his gloves, but not

               at STARKS' scathed face. STARKS, drenched in BLOOD and SWEAT,

</b>               BECKER momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien.
               After some seconds, STARKS passes out and BECKER -- hands
               trembling -- looks as though he might stick him back in when,
               instead, he starts to remove him from the Jacket himself. He
               silently and carefully unties each of the straps -- taking
               unusual care for Starks' flesh as he prepares to put him on a
               stretcher.

               reveals Starks' frailty. She looks to the window then and

               Eugene inside. LORENSON can't help but look down the hall to
               make sure no one's there.

<b>               INT. STUDY/OFFICE, LORENSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 1992
</b>

<b>               
</b>               LORENSON sits across from EUGENE, holding up a picture of a
               DOG. Between them is a tray of MILK and COOKIES.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     LORENSON
</b>                           Come on Eugene, try to say it with
                           me. This is a "DOG".

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     EUGENE
</b>                           D--d---d----.

<b>               
</b>               But Eugene can't hold the sound of the letter long enough to
               make the word. An absence seizure takes hold of him as he
               looks out unconsciously into space.

<b>               
</b>               LORENSON moves closer to him.

<b>               
</b>                                      LORENSON [Softly]
                            What's happening to you?

<b>               
</b>               LORENSON checks Eugene's pulse and leans in close to the
               boy's unconscious face like the answer is there if she just
               looks hard enough.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     LORENSON
</b>                           Are you having a seizure? Is that
                           really what's going on?

<b>               
</b>               LORENSON spots a corner of Eugene's EYE twitching slightly,
               and, rushing to get a better look, takes the shade off of the
               nearby LAMP and holds it above his head so she can get a
               better look at him.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                                                             116.
</b>
<b>               
</b>               Just then, TALIA opens the door, startling Lorenson. She
               knocks over the MILK and, as it spills on the LAMP CORD -- now
               on Eugene's lap -- it causes an ELECTRIC SHOCK. Eugene catches
               it. TALIA gasps and Lorenson watches the boy in fear.

<b>               
</b>               The moment passes and Eugene -- more responsive than he has
               ever been before -- looks at his mother and Lorenson. He
               doesn't know what's happened but he is aware, and awake,
               like never before.

<b>               
</b>               EUGENE picks right up where he and Lorenson left off.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     EUGENE

<b>               
</b>               TALIA and LORENSON look at him and each other at shock.
                                     STARKS [O.S., distantly]
                           You're going to...shock the boy and
                           then things will change for him.

<b>

<b>                                     LORENSON

<b>               
</b>               EUGENE holds Lorenson's gaze steadily for a few moments.

<b>               
</b>                                      LORENSON [Stunned himself]

                           And it's reset him. Not permanently
                           probably...but at least for a little
                           while. They use it on epileptic
                           patients sometimes...

</b>                           But he's not epileptic.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     LORENSON
</b>                           No, but he is having seizures.

<b>               
</b>               TALIA looks at LORENSON. She's still confused. LORENSON's
               merely surprised.

                           enough.

</b>               Bob Dylan plays on the RADIO. STARKS smiles as he hears him
               and turns the music up; the act is sad because, as LORENSON
               notices, it belongs to someone with an interest to live.

<b>               
</b>               DR. LORENSON and STARKS drive up to Jean and Jackie's house.

<b>

<b>               
</b>               STARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on
               it as best as he can. The sound, however, is still
               understandably soft.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. He
               opens it and looks inside. We first see his face, and the
               devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on.

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years
               old. Though STARKS expected it, he falters under the
               disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman
               he loved. As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to
               break down.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS shakes his head, looking at her. She looks beautiful,
               and still hopeful. Her life lays ahead of her and her fate --
               when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible
               from this innocent, still promising image.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS nods. JACKIE smiles. It's all he can do not to
               crumble.

               She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in
               his eyes.

<b>

<b>                                       JACKIE

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get
               her. LORENSON has gotten out of the car and is waiting
               outside on the porch. STARKS remains in the doorway.

<b>

                           home that afternoon we were stuck
                           on the highway. The guy you yelled

</b>               She gives him a once over, and, seeing how weakened he looks,
               decides intuitively he can't be much harm. She also notices
               LORENSON waiting by the car.

</b>               STARKS looks at JACKIE, hesitating because of her. Sensing
               this, JEAN asks Jackie to leave.

<b>

<b>                                      JEAN

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE leaves and walks to the yard. STARKS watches.

<b>                                      STARKS
</b>                            I can't stay long. [Motioning to
                            Lorenson] That's my doctor and I
                            gotta get back to the hospital.
                            Everything I want to say is in this
                            letter. [Beat] You can check as
                            much of it as you can.

<b>

</b>                           I won't be around when you read
                           it...but I hope you believe it.
                           It'd be a real shame if you didn't.

<b>               
</b>               JEAN looks baffled but, seeming to grasp his urgency, nods.

<b>               
</b>               JACKIE has been watching this exchange from the shed. When he
               looks over there, he catches her eye and CALLS OUT, with what
               strength he has left...

<b>               
</b>               These are the hardest words STARKS has probably ever had to
               say. JACKIE just stares after him, as does JEAN, as he shows
               himself out.

<b>               
</b>               As STARKS is walking away, we see his eyes begin to tear in
               the cold -- but not from it.

<b>               
</b>
<b>               INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992

               JACKIE abruptly runs after him.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS stops in his tracks; he clears as much sadness from
               his face as he can before he turns around to face her.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                      STARKS

                            Jackie.

</b>                            Ok.

<b>               
</b>               Then, suddenly, she sticks her hand for him to shake, as she
               did that day on the roadside; only now, it trembles slightly
               in the cold.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS takes JACKIE'S HAND and holds it in his own softly and
               affectionately. JEAN and DR. LORENSON look on curiously as
               STARKS looks in her face, at her hand in his, and then to the
               heavens for the means to get through this.

<b>               
</b>               As STARKS lets go at last, JACKIE looks back at him, sensing
               the connection even if she doesn't know it yet.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car.
               LORENSON moves to help him, but STARKS tells her not to with
               his eyes. He makes his way to the car on his own.

                           died. It didn't end anything though.

                            knowledge of death. That it can all
                            end, even when you least want it

<b>               
</b>               STARKS is not restrained this time though we don't see who is
               walking down the hall with him. He runs his hand over his
               forehead and looks at it when he's done. STILL NO CUT.

<b>               
</b>               They slow down their pace as they round the corner, as STARKS
               appears dizzier and dizzier. He doesn't stop and the PERSON
               beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until STARKS TRIPS.

<b>

               GLASS, one PIECE cuts a neat, deep, fatal GASH in Starks'
               head.

<b>

               their focus, we see the BLURRED, indiscernible FACE of the
               PERSON leaning over him to see if he's all right.

               into the Jacket one final time. BLOOD pours from his head
               onto the floor.

<b>               
</b>               The PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight
               onto the metal slab. She's doing it as carefully, and gently,
               as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the
               JACKET, almost as if the act itself is a humane one.

<b>               
</b>               When the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck and
               the hardest part of the struggle has passed, STARKS smiles
               kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead LIGHT in the
               room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in.

</b>               As the drawer is pushed in, one of the STRAPS gets caught on
               the side, CUTTING STARKS' ARM. We hear a small CRY in the
               room. Then the HANDS adjust the strap and slowly push STARKS

               tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has finally
               retrieved his memory without it haunting him...

</b>                            I promise you, Jean. No matter how
                            bad the days and things around you
                            look, they look better awake than
                            they do asleep. I can offer you
                            some proof: when you die, there's
                            only one thing you want to have
                            happen...sometimes so badly it
                            comes true, I guess. [Beat] You
                            want to come back.

               on its surface, the reflection of a TEENAGE BOY'S FACE before
               he touches it and sends it rippling...
               5) EXT. A NEW ENGLAND BEACH: STARKS (20s) dressed in a black

               suit, holding an URN, letting the ASHES fly into the water...

<b>               
</b>               6) EXT. DESERT: A SANDSTORM WHIRLS round before it's replaced

</b>               We see now that it was DR. LORENSON who put Starks in.
               Exhausted from the physical strain of getting him in there,
               she stares at the closed drawer, like looking at it is one
               way to look after Starks.

<b>               
</b>               JEAN puts down STARKS' LETTER and walks out of the kitchen
               and watches JACKIE sitting absently on the couch, looking
               past the TV.

<b>               
</b>               JEAN kneels wordlessly beside her daughter and looks her
               daughter in the eye. JACKIE looks back curiously as JEAN
               wraps her arms around Jackie's LEGS and rests her head in her
               lap, holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly
               missed a tragedy.

<b>               EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2005
</b>

<b>               
</b>               Over the sounds of CARS slushing in the snow, an IMAGE fades
               up slowly on the screen, until we see it's STARKS, standing
               in the parking lot outside the diner once more.

<b>               
</b>               This time he seems situated, and hopeful. After a slightly
               longer wait than the first time, JACKIE walks out -- in the
               same way as before except that she wears a NURSE'S UNIFORM
               and an unmistakable air of vitality.

<b>               
</b>               Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same
               attraction between them teeming even more than before. Even
               as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a
               BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold, STARKS is
               someone we see she wants to be near.

<b>               
</b>               Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does: she looks beautiful,
               alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to
               leave. She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the
               world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her
               being.

<b>

<b>                                     JACKIE
</b>                           Hey there. [Beat] You ok?

<b>               
</b>               STARKS revels in the moment. In their reunion.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     STARKS
</b>                           I think so.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                     JACKIE
</b>                           You're bleeding pretty bad there.

<b>               
</b>               STARKS touches his FOREHEAD in a panic and, seeing the BLOOD
               on his hands, looks up at her, terrified. Sensing this, she
               moves closer to calm him.

<b>               
</b>
<b>                                      JACKIE
</b>                            It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just
                            a cut. We can get it fixed.

                            New Year's Day. You're not going to
                            get a cab. Especially not here. And
                            you're gonna freeze if you stand out
                            here in the snow much longer. I'm on
                            my way back to my shift at the

<b>               
</b>               STARKS falters slightly as he walks. JACKIE helps him make it
               to the car, much like before...
