<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (2003)
</b>                         
          The night is stillborn.
                         
          Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see
          are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions
          of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw
          huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in
          the dirt...
                         
<b>          INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
</b>                         
          And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father
          and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM"
          (9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him.
                         
<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>                         
          And slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light
          seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly
          orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming
          into this village carrying flaming torches.
                         
<b>          INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
</b>                         
          The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming
          from outside, and suddenly --
                         
<b>          SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS!
</b>                         
          The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their
          tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army
          (LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up!
          Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands --
          "Don't shoot!" --
                         
<b>          KAK! KAK! KAK!
</b>                         
          And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and
          boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks
          free -- scrambles deeper into the room --
                         
          THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of
          storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing
          into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE
          SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING
          WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out
          of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED
          PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground...

          families yanked out of their burning tukuls by LRA rebels -- the
          adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the
          women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled
          together and weeping --
                         
          -- and now we see WILLIAM hauled out -- his captor shouting to
          another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled
          from the group and forced onto her knees...
                         
          ... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying
          something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- "Kill her!" -- WILLIAM
          shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and --
                         
          CRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down --
          blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet --
          crying -- shaking with fear...
                         
          ... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the
          hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and
          son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him
          now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this
          terrible moment... and before we see how this ends we --

          And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in
          jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old,
          with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good-
          looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is
          tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark
          eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.

          We see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal

          watch, some silver rings and a lighter.
                         
          He looks up to the Clerk and flashes a malicious smile --

          A beat-up CHEVY VEGA parked at the curb. Sam's wife, LYNN, 30's, in
          a thrift store dress, leaning against the car, waiting.
                         
          Sam (dressed in civilian clothes now) pushes out a door and she sees
          him, straightens her hair, an uneasy smile.

          A dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every

          An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to

          of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's --
          her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without

          Eight months later and we're looking at a simple, cinder block
          church which is under construction. A scattering of pickup trucks
          parked at the site and a flurry of activity. WORKMEN pouring cement,
          laying sheetrock, etc. And Sam in the middle of this crew, putting
          the finishing touches on a timber frame which is about to be raised.

          Children at play, laughing, screaming, swinging on swing sets and

          against a (new) black Harley, watching Paige playing in the group.

          here doing what they can, toweling off his forehead, trying to keep
          him warm, as Donnie pulls the sheets tighter, gritting his teeth,
          shaking his head.

          coming from inside, playing an unlikely rendition of a spiritual

          organ, and the GARAGE BAND playing the rocked-out hymn.
                         
          A handful of people here sitting in pews. FARMERS in clean overalls,
          FACTORY WORKERS, BIKERS still dressed in their riding leathers,
          listening to the garage band and chatting.
                         
          And now we see Lynn and Paige (11) standing near the back. Lynn

          Palpable excitement ripples through the compound... Sam's soldiers
          grabbing their weapons and forming a ragged line near the Suburban

          ... the back door to the Suburban opens and a black man, dressed in
          shirtsleeves and slacks, steps out. The same man we saw giving the
          fiery speech on the little outdoor TV in Nimule earlier -- JOHN

          Sam and Garang walking through the middle of camp, trailed by a
          squad of SPLA bodyguards and camp children...

          And they continue through the camp. A few of the children running up
          to Garang, touching the cuff of his shirt, then sprinting away...

          And another child runs up to Garang, touching him, and then sprints
          away giggling...

</b>           I founded the SPLA in order to fight for
           the future of Sudan because nobody else
           would. We fight for freedom from the
           government in Khartoum, for the right to
           vote, and for the right to worship any
           god one may choose.

</b>           But most important to me is our struggle
           for the children. Their laughter has been
           lost to this country for far too long.

</b>           Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is
           a waste of time. You gotta go out and
           make it.

</b>           You are correct, but we must fight them
           at every level. Part of my battle is
           waged in those rooms. We must talk of
           peace, but keep our rifles ready for war.
                         
          Sam turning to him, coming to an understanding here. Realizing that
          both of them are warriors in the same fight.
                         
<b>                          GARANG (CONT'D)

          of the compound. Garang turning to him, eyes suddenly becoming
          dark...
                         
<b>                          GARANG (CONT'D)
</b>           There is a cost for freedom, Sam. A price
           for the future of these people. Some pay
           with their lives, others pay in different
           ways.
<b>                          (BEAT)

          REVERSE to see a PLAYGROUND: two or three battered swingsets, a few
          see-saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe.
                         
          And the kids SPRINTING for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like
          ants... hitting the swing-sets... and then we hear it... something
          we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of
          laughter... children losing themselves in play. Innocence flooding
          back.

          Sam slamming the cabinet closed, moving past her without saying a

          Inevitable. And Sam moves past him without saying a word.

          And we see Sam in a corner, off from the rest of the group. And
          maybe it's just the lighting in here, but there's a darkness around
          him -- literally as if the space surrounding this man is devoid of
          light.
                         
          And we see William working his way through the room... refilling
          cups with hot tea... his particular job here... and he comes up to
          Sam and accidently sloshes some of the tea onto Sam's arm and he
          flinches! -- burned -- "Damn it!" -- shoots his arm out and
          accidentally hits William in the chest -- knocking him backward onto

          The entire room falls silent. Nobody moving.
