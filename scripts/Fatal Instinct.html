</b>
<b>               EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT
</b>
               The sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night 
               air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. 
               The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell.

               and a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier.

               After several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one 
               of her shoes, stretching out stickily. Two steps later, a 
               piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with 
               each step.

               The MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and sensuous 
               body. She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer 
               around her soft curves. Her hair is long and blond.

</b>                         To some guys, women are like a cheap 
                         puzzle... with pieces that just don't 
                         fit. They think the soul of a woman 
                         is darker than a back alley... more 
                         tangled than a telephone cord... and 
                         colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada. 
                         But those guys don't even have a 
                         clue.

               She stops at the railing. We see an incredibly beautiful 
               face and cool, alluring eyes. This is LOLA CAIN. The term 
               "femme fatale" was coined for her. She's on display... and 
               knows it.

</b>                         When you know women the way I do, 
                         you understand exactly what what 
                         makes them tick... what makes them 
                         hum... what makes them jiggle up and 
                         down when they walk. And it's not 
                         the kind of thing you can learn from 
                         a correspondence course.

               The CAMERA MOVES with her as she walks on, passing TWO MEN 
               whose eyes are glued to her. We HOLD ON THEM.

               One is NED RAVINE, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair 
               trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him... 
               coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat 
               dampening his shirt. He's a cop. A plain clothes detective 
               who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost.

               Next to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at 
               least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations 
               except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos 
               from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his 
               fingers.

               The CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED. His eyes are fixed on Lola.

               She walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper 
               sticks to the gum on her shoe. She stands at the railing.

</b>
               Arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned. The 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE NED. It isn't "voice-over" 
               narration at all. Ned is actually talking out loud.

</b>                         It's true. Women are very complex, 
                         but if you know how to read 'em... 
                         they're an open book. You can always 
                         tell the rotten apples from the 
                         peaches.

                         He's got cash. He's gonna want to 
                         spend it. This is one of the few 
                         places that still takes cash. Sooner 
                         or later... he's gotta turn up.

                         see him... you'll know him.

               In the b.g., MILO CRUMLEY, the "Support Hose Bandit", ambles 
               by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through 
               the panty-hose pulled down over his head.

                         North America. Maybe the world!

               He pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and 
               turns the container over.

                         You want some?

               Ned shakes his head. Arch heads off to the Nacho stand. Ned 
               steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean.

               A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a 
               recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME.

               A beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing. He 
               tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness. 
               Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes.

</b>                         Sure.

               Ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse. 
               She pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips... 
               her eyes on Ned, sizing him up.

</b>                         No thanks. I have plenty.

               He pulls out a handful of matchbooks, shows her, then stuffs 
               them back in his pocket.

               He turns and walks along the pier. She falls into step beside 
               him, lighting her own cigarette. A saxophone player named 
               DIZZY follows behind them, continuing to play. He's the actual 
               source of the romantic THEME MUSIC we've been hearing.

               Lola looks toward a nearby hot dog vendor.

               Lola turns to the hot dog VENDOR, raising two fingers.

               She takes them... hands one to Ned. He picks up the plastic 
               mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first.

               Ned REACTS to this, squeezing the container. A stream of 
               mustard squirts out, hitting the front of Lola's dress.

               Flustered, he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket 
               pocket, then tries to wipe the mustard off Lola's dress, 
               smearing it all over her, making it worse. She watches him 
               with a cool, detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously.

               Suddenly, Ned stops, looking off. He sees... Milo Crumley 
               going into the PUBLIC RESTROOM. Ned starts to leave. Lola 
               grabs his hand, holding it tightly against her breast.

               He heads for the men's room... signaling to Arch, who's 
               waiting in line at the Nacho stand. Arch motions at the long 
               line... all UNIFORMED COPS... shrugging helplessly.

               Several MEN are at the urinals. Milo, still wearing the panty 
               hose over his head, washes his face at the sink. He looks 
               up, sees Ned enter. Ned sees Milo... reacts, pulling the 
               frankfurter out of his pocket and pointing it.

               Milo bolts, slamming into Ned, knocking him back through the 
               door of a stall, into the lap of the MAN inside.

               Milo bursts out, colliding with Arch. They both go down in a 
               flurry of Nacho chips and cheese. Arch helps Milo to his 
               feet, apologizing profusely... picking up the gun that Milo 
               dropped, handing it back to him. Milo sprints off down the 
               pier.

               A beat later, Ned bursts out the door... dashing after Milo.

<b>               INT. BUMPER CAR PAVILION - NIGHT
</b>
               ...and drags a FLUSTERED MAN out of a bumper car, jumps in, 
               and speeds away!

               A beat later, Ned runs up, followed by Arch. Ned flashes his 
               badge at a FRECKLE-FACED KID in one of the bumper cars.

</b>                         Police emergency! I need your car!

               He pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable FLASHING 
               RED LIGHT on the dashboard... then speeds off after Milo, a 
               SIREN WAILING! He zig-zags through the crush of other bumper 
               cars in the pavilion.

               Ned's bumper car catches up with Milo, pulling alongside. 
               Milo turns the wheel, RAMMING Ned! Ned RAMS him back, both 
               bumper cars swerving violently... spraying SPARKS!

               Ned SLAMS Milo's car again! Milo loses control, spins out 
               and SMASHES into the pavillion railing!

               Ned swerves to avoid a collision, but RAMS into two other 
               bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt. A BEAT. The AIRBAG 
               inflates in his bumper car.

               Arch runs up as Ned pulls himself from the wreckage. They 
               turn to see Milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over 
               the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an 
               alley between two buildings. A sign on the building says: 
<b>               DEAD END ALLEY.
</b>
               Ned and Arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow 
               after Milo.

</b>
               Milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the 
               alley and scrambles up the wire mesh. Suddenly, Ned's hand 
               shoots out, grabs Milo's ankle, yanking him down hard.

               Milo jumps to his feet, swinging at Ned, who catches Milo's 
               fist with his hand, stopping it cold... neatly snapping a 
               handcuff on his wrist. He shoves Milo's arm against the fence 
               and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink.

               A SWITCHBLADE flashes out of Milo's other hand with a sharp 
               CLICK! Milo slashes the blade at Ned, just missing his face. 
               On the backswing, Ned parries with his own switchblade and 
               flips Milo's knife away.

               Milo pulls a .45 Calibre REVOLVER with his free hand! Ned 
               shoves his finger into the end of the barrel. Milo looks 
               surprised... then sneers, clicking the hammer back.

               Milo hesitates, unsure. Finally, he releases the gun. Ned 
               raises it up on the end of his finger. Arch pulls it off 
               with a loud POP!

               Ned cuffs Milo's hands behind him... spins him around.

               we hear more heavy breathing... urgent whispers... lust... 
               passion... squeaky bedsprings!

               A trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the 
               bed... shoes, a dress, slip, bra, nylons, panties... greasy 
               coveralls with a "Frank Kelbo - Mobile Mechanic" namepatch, 
               dirty work boots, a wrench and a gigantic grease gun...

               The bed shakes violently. A female VOICE calls the shots as 
               various tools drop to the floor.

               bored, contemptuous disinterest, picking up the coffee pot.

               Lana and Frank stare at each other lustfully, really hot

               Suddenly, Ned opens the back door, glaring right at Frank... 
               not even noticing Lana on the table.

               He slams the door. A beat. Lana and Frank begin to devour 
               each other with passionate kisses. Another beat. The front 
               doorbell RINGS once... then again.

               Richly appointed with stately oak, walls lined with law books. 
               As in all "Noir" thrillers, venetian blinds cast dramatic 
               slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room. 
               Ned hurries in, rummaging through the files on his desk.

               LAURA, a strikingly lovely brunette, enters from the outer 
               office, files in hand. She is Ned's astute, dedicated, self-
               sacrificing "girl-friday" and legal secretary. She keeps his 
               life from spinning crazily apart. She absolutely adores him.

               He smiles gratefully... drops the file into his briefcase.

               Ned heads for the office washroom. Laura darts ahead of him 
               into the washroom and turns the water on.

               Ned steps in... splashes some water on his face. Laura grabs 
               a towel from the rack where three small towels hang neatly... 
               hands it to Ned. He dries his face, looking at her with

               Laura neatly folds the end of the toilet paper into a point.

                         of giving you a rebate on my salary.

               He clicks off the razor, turns to look at her for a long

               the towel onto the rack, where it hangs sloppily askew... 
               right next to her face. He exits.

               Laura stares at the towel with a tortured expression. The

               LAURA'S HUSBAND appears behind her, glaring insanely. He 
               looks toward the towel rack.

               There are three towels... with HIS - HIS - HIS embossed along 
               the bottom edge. One towel hangs longer than the others.

               the rest.

               Milo unwraps a piece of bubble gum and pushes it into his

</b>                         Yeah. These are them.

               Ned jumps to his feet, pacing dramatically, grabbing the 
               cards.

                         "You have the right to remain silent, 
                         if you waive that right, anything 
                         you say... may be used against you 
                         in a court of law." Is that right?

                         WRONG! The official Miranda warning 
                         is... "anything you say CAN be used 
                         against you in a court of law." Not 
                         "may"... "CAN!"
                              (on the attack)
                         Don't you know the difference between 
                         "can" and "may", Detective? Every 
                         school kid knows "can" is a verb 
                         that indicates ability to perform, 
                         while "may" is a verbal auxiliary 
                         indicating the permission to act.

               Ned pivots into the witness stand, changing his attitude 
               from aggressive attorney to defensive, angry witness as he 
               hits the chair.

               The courtroom ERUPTS! The Judge bangs the gavel. Ned strides 
               proudly toward the defense table.

               Ned turns. The Judge motions with a finger for Ned to approach 
               the bench. Ned does, resting his hand on it.

                         what it is today! Court's adjourned!

               The Judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it 
               on the bench like a gavel. BAM! BAM! BAM! It is DEAFENING! 
               Everyone covers their ears in pain.

               The THX Sound System Logo appears at the bottom of the

               Ned turns the key... enters through the private door. He 
               HEARS the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing Lola's 
               Theme... his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the 
               outer office.

               pushes the door open. It's Lola. She wears a tight white 
               dress, long white gloves and broad-brimmed hat. The hat tips 
               up slowly, revealing her eyes.

               Ned reaches in his pocket, pulls out a wet paper towel.

               Lola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin. She smiles.

                         can do... with a bobbie pin.

               Ned looks at the door. The frame and lock have been brutally 
               chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them! She 
               pulls out a pack of cigarettes... BLACK LUNG LITES.

               He goes to the water cooler. She lights up, exhaling a soft 
               cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile, her voice purring.

                         So... I hear you go both ways.

               Ned hesitates... about to drink from the paper cup.

               He gulps the water down, crumbles the cup in his hand.

                         they all deserve a fair and costly 
                         trial.

               Ned turns, tries to casually "dunk" the crumpled cup in the 
               waste basket. He misses.

               Laura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms. She 
               sees Ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to 
               pick it up.

               She picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket.

               Laura sets the heavy load of books on the desk and steps 
               toward Lola, extending her hand. Lola takes her time removing 
               the long white glove... finally reaching out and shaking 
               Laura's hand with a condescending air.

                         So lovely to meet you, Laura.

               Ned grabs the books and turns to the bookshelf, replacing 
               each lawbook in its proper slot.

               The "handshake" between Lola and Laura turns tense, then 
               aggressive, eventually becoming a "standing Indian wrestle" 
               as they try to force each other off balance with sheer force. 
               Ned is oblivious to the battle behind him, chattering away.

                         R thru B... W thru F...

               Laura suddenly whirls Lola around, putting her in an arm 
               lock. But Lola elbows Laura in the stomach! Laura doubles 
               over. Lola feigns sympathy, taking her hand... then spins, 
               twisting Laura's arm, flipping her head over heels!

               Laura lands on the couch... upside down... gasping. Lola 
               strikes a haughty pose, still holding her lit cigarette. She 
               takes a drag. Laura checks her watch, then tumbles off the 
               couch, landing on her feet. She straightens her skirt.

               Finished with the books, Ned turns... smiles.

               Lola looks at Laura... icy, haughty, triumphant. Laura moves 
               reluctantly toward the door, sees the lock and door frame 
               chewed to pieces... whirls around, heads back toward Ned.

               ...and exits. Ned sits down on the corner of the desk. Lola 
               sits in the chair across from him.

                         underwear.

               She crosses her legs suggestively... then slowly, enticingly, 
               re-crosses them in the other direction.

               Unimpressed, Ned opens Laura's desk drawer... pulls a pair 
               of sexy lace panties from a Kleenex-style dispenser box 
               labeled "PANDORA'S POP-UP PANTIES"... which pulls another 
               pair up into position. He tosses the panties to Lola.

               Lana, now wearing the diaphanous gown, pulls him inside. She 
               kisses him hungrily, slipping a frilly plastic shower cap 
               with a gaudy floral design on his head.

               She walks to the living room. Frank follows, still wearing 
               the shower cap. Lana snaps her fingers.

               She steps to a table, pulls the cover off an elaborate scale-
               model of Dealey Plaza and a train station, complete with HO-
               Scale model trains chugging around the tracks.

               She uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot.

               The model train CHUGS faster, the train whistle SHRIEKING a

               The COPS on duty listen raptly, getting maudlin and dewey-
               eyed. Tears roll down the cheeks of the BOOKING SERGEANT.

               her. She turns! Frank is on the other side, curled up, 
               snoring. She's laying between both men!

               Lana elbows Frank. He stirs, groggy. She covers his mouth... 
               indicating Ned. Frank's eyes bug out! He slips out of bed. 
               The bed frame SQUEAKS LOUDLY! Frank freezes. Ned sleeps on 
               steadily.

               Frank grabs his clothes. An unending torrent of coins fall 
               out of his pants pockets, CLANGING on the floor! He freezes. 
               Ned sleeps on. Frank retrieves the coins, clumsily stepping 
               on the TV REMOTE CONTROL.

               A high-tech, sleekly designed TELEVISION MONITOR rises up... 
               clicks ON. Frank tries frantically to push the set down, but 
               it keeps rising into position. An IMAGE appears. It's WILLARD 
               SCOTT, doing the weather on the TODAY SHOW.

               Frank grabs the remote control, frantically pounding on all 
               the buttons. The VOLUME goes up... SOUND BLASTING!

                         female! Smokes three cigars a day, 
                         drinks a straight shot of vodka at 
                         bedtime... and still has sex!

               The alarm clock goes off, CLANGING LOUDLY! Lana dives for 
               it, slamming her hand down, killing the alarm.

               Going for a double-play, she flings the clock at the TV, 
               nailing the on/off switch! Silence. Ned is still out cold.

               Frank moves toward the door... but with each step the floor 
               CREAKS LOUDLY! He turns the knob. It CLUNKS! He pulls the 
               door open v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y and it CRE-E-E-E-A-K-S like 
               the piercing metal brakes of a train!

               He blows Lana a kiss, then pulls the door closed very gently. 
               It sticks. He pulls harder. The knob pops off in his hand 
               and he falls backward, tumbling down the stairs with a HUGE 
               RACKET! Ned doesn't stir. Finally it's SILENT. Lana exhales.

               A SMALL BIRD lands on the sill of the open window, trilling 
               a sweet little "CHIRP." Ned sits bolt upright, irritated.

               He grabs his shoe, heaving it toward the open window.

               Frank glances back up at the bedroom window with an arrogant

               Ned comes down the courthouse steps. He pauses in the street, 
               glimpsing the back of a WOMAN passing nearby... a STUNNING 
               BLOND decked out in a clinging dress and fashionable hat... 
               a long strip of toilet paper trailing from her high heel 
               shoe. It must be LOLA. He turns to watch her.

               in an overstuffed leather chair. Ned and Laura enter.

               the gum on the bottom of her shoe. It falls off with a CLUNK.

               He sits on the stool next to her. She looks at him, smiles.

                         me to take care of this.

               He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a LIT CIGARETTE. 
               It has a very long ash.

               She takes it... inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out 
               through her smile. It flows out for a loooooooooong time! 
               More smoke than she could ever have inhaled. Then...

                              (looks around, then)
                         It's hot tonight.

</b>                         Is it? I never know. My body heat 
                         runs about twenty degrees above 
                         normal.

               He notices the drink in her hand is BOILING. A saxophone 
               begins to softly wail Lola's Theme. Ned looks over to see a 
               QUARTET, featuring Dizzy on sax. The GUITARIST spontaneously 
               bursts into FLAME! A FIREMAN, in full gear, jumps up from 
               the bar and puts out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. 
               None of the band members miss a beat.

</b>                         I doubt we'll find one. Even the 
                         wind chimes on my porch aren't moving 
                         much these days. They keep thudding 
                         softly, like dairy cows bumping butts 
                         in the night. I go out there expecting 
                         to find a cool breeze... but it's 
                         just a lot of hot air.

               Ned glances at the MALE CUSTOMERS... sitting at the bar across 
               from them. They're staring coldly at Ned.

               A beat of realization, then the stool collapses with a CRASH! 
               Ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over.

               Lola stares at Ned for a long moment... then SLAPS his face. 
               He doesn't move, remaining staunchly macho. Then, suddenly, 
               she SLUGS HIM so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar!

               She pauses to give him a flicker of a COY SMILE... then picks 
               up her drink and moves to a nearby table. Ned struggles to 
               his feet and staggers to the door.

<b>               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
               Ned is a mess! Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. 
               Shirt soaked in sweat. He turns the radio ON. LOLA'S THEME 
               starts playing.

               A small ceiling fan hangs from the interior roof of his car, 
               turning slowly. The venetian blinds on his side windows are 
               partially open, letting in slashes of dramatic light.

<b>               ANGLE - HIS POV OF ROAD
</b>
               He's following Lola's car. It signals and turns left.

<b>               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
               Still hot, Ned pulls the chain on the ceiling fan. It spins 
               faster. MUCH faster! The car becomes like a wind tunnel!

<b>               EXT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The two cars enter a long drive, coming to a stop near a 
               large two story house surrounded by lush greenery.

               Ned climbs out... his wind-blown hair flattened on one side 
               and sticking out crazily.

<b>               ANGLE - LOLA'S CAR DOOR - NED'S POV

               It opens. Lola's legs swing out. The CAMERA PANS DOWN her 
               long legs to her feet. The car floormat is stuck to one shoe. 
               She casually shakes it off... going to the front door.

<b>               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               They enter. It's DARK. Ned squints into the shadows.

               Lola CLAPS her hands twice and all the LIGHTS COME ON. She 
               smiles at him... drops her car keys on the hall table, then 
               goes up the stairs.

               Ned drops his car keys on the table too and follows her.

<b>               EXT. PORCH OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Lola clicks on a porch light. She and Ned step out. Dozens 
               of small boxes hang around the perimeter of the porch.

               Ned steps over, running his hands along the boxes. They "thud" 
               against each other.

                         boxes.

               He slips several boxes off, releasing clusters of the metal 
               chimes. They "tinkle" and "clang" melodically in the breeze.

               Lola comes in, looks around, then down. She removes her shoe, 
               pulling off two scraps of paper stuck to the gum on her heel.

<b>               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Ned is looking through a book... "KAMIKAZE KAMA SUTRA - The

               in, hands Ned the two scraps of paper.

               He hands them back to her, but she gently pushes them away.

               She slips them into his jacket pocket... then sensuously 
               slides her hands around him, grabbing his buns, pulling him 
               closer.

               Ned pulls the door shut. The lock CLICKS. He pauses by his 
               car, realizing something, heaves a sigh, goes back to the 
               door.

               He tries the knob, but the door is locked. He looks through 
               the small window. He sees Lola standing inside... breathing 
               heavily, bracing herself against the staircase bannister, 
               hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart.

               He pushes against the door. It won't budge. He goes to the 
               large window, gazing inside. She slides one hand enticingly 
               across her breast and thigh, striking a seductive pose.

               He points toward the door, motioning for her to unlock it. 
               She looks away. Frustrated, Ned tries the window. It's locked.

               He picks up a wrought iron chair, SLAMS it into the window! 
               The heavy chair falls apart. The glass doesn't even vibrate!

               He sees a riding power mower in the driveway... jumps into 
               the seat, starts the engine... barreling toward the front of 
               the house! THUNDER CRASHES and LIGHTNING FLASHES in the sky!

               He PLOWS into the side of the house, SMASHING a huge hole 
               thru the wall!... MOWING a swath in the carpet!

               Lola GASPS. Ned climbs off the mower, moving toward her. She 
               opens her arms, breathless. The MUSIC SWELLS dramatically! 
               She intercepts him, embracing him passionately.

               Impatient, she crushes her mouth against his, kissing him 
               hard, desperately clawing at his clothes. She's relentless... 
               devouring him with her lips and tongue.

               Overwhelmed, he succumbs to her passion. His car keys drop 
               from his hand. She pushes him down toward the floor.

               She grabs his pants by the cuffs... rips one pant leg off!

               pointed finger of each hand... and a large spinning platter

               Ned and Lola, both in yellow rain slickers, ravish each other 
               lustfully on the roof, sliding down the incline of shingles. 
               Oblivious to the peril, they slip right over the edge!

               entangled. They fall apart, gasping for breath. A beat.

               The cell wall is a clutter of PHOTOS: Hitler... Mussolini... 
               Charles Manson... and his mother, Mrs. Shady.

               A man's muscular naked torso rises into frame, his back to 
               us. He's doing pull-ups, his body covered with TATTOOS!

               Quotes on each arm... "Don't have a cow, man!" - Bart

               On one shoulder, a gravestone with the epitaph "I told you I

               In the center of his back... we see a big tattoo of Ned's

               It's MAX SHADY... with a HUGE "Double Corona" CIGAR in his 
               mouth. On his chest is a tattoo that reads: THIS SPACE FOR

               stocking hanging from the blades. The house is a wreck!

               The CAMERA MOVES DOWN to Ned and Lola, both reclining in a 
               big claw-foot bathtub, facing each other, their arms draped 
               lazily over the sides. Ned's eyes are closed.

               "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" plays on the stereo in the b.g.

               Lola's hand reaches for an ICE PICK on the floor, raising it 
               up slowly. Then... CLICK!... ignites the cigarette lighter 
               in the handle, touching the flame to the end of her cigarette.

               She chips away a big chunk of ice from the block in a silver 
               ice bucket beside her... then sensuously rubs the ice across 
               her breasts. Ned winces at the sight of this.

               Lola smiles at him, then lets the chunk of ice slide into 
               the water... and pushes it between Ned's legs. He cringes, 
               eyes crossed. The familiar repetition of MUSICAL notes from 
               the stereo DRONES LOUDER... grabbing Ned's attention.

               A typical police squad room... smoke-filled, cluttered, busy. 
               Arch sits at a desk doing paperwork, surrounded by the Gang 
               Members... who are also filling out papers. Arch SINGS to 
               himself, munching on nachos from a big pile of chips. The 
               Gang Members harmonize with him.

               A Gang Member reaches for a nacho chip. Arch grabs for the 
               gun in his shoulder holster.

               The Gang Member drops the chip. Arch pops it in his mouth, 
               continues singing. The Gang Members join in with harmony.

               Ned enters in the background, carrying a box with airholes 
               in it. He steps over to his desk, looking at the singing 
               Gang Members, then motions like a choir leader, cutting them 
               off neatly.

               They all hand over their completed paperwork. Ned stares at

               notices something O.S. and gets up.

               staring at the hat. A dignified looking OLDER GENTLEMAN 
               approaches. Frank quickly slips the hat on his head.

               The Older Gentleman sits on the bench across from them. He 
               opens a paper sack and begins neatly laying his lunch out 
               next to him. An apple, sandwich, napkin, Mountain Dew.

               He ZOOMS OFF into the night.

               Ned steps up behind Lana, slips his arms around her.

               Hands lower the newspaper... revealing Max himself, with the

               "BEER BIMBO." A price tag hangs from it. She is beaming.

               In the b.g., Hawaiian DANCERS juggle flaming torches as they 
               dance around an ICE SCULPTURE of a Hula Dancer.

                         out there.

               Ned motions casually toward the world "out there"... sticking 
               his thumb into the eye of a WAITER who is bending over to 
               pick up a spoon, setting off a chaotic CHAIN REACTION of 
               small disasters that finally culminates with someone near 
               the dance floor bumping into the Torch Juggler, throwing his 
               rhythm off.

               Distracted, he starts catching the FLAMING ENDS of the 
               torches! OW! OH! YI! OUCH! YIPES!

               He drops them all. The Waiter who bumped into him, politely 
               picks up one of the flaming torches and hands it back to the 
               Torch Juggler. He grabs the flaming end of the torch... and 
               lets out a SCREAM!

               He lunges toward a voluptuous HULA GIRL ICE SCULPTURE, 
               grabbing the frozen breasts. His burned hands SIZZLE!

               Ned and Laura don't even notice... gazing only at each other.

               inter-locked cherry stems.

               Ned reacts, shaken, glancing nervously at Laura. She smiles,

               She lights her cigarette with the ice pick lighter, then 
               flips it like a jackknife. It STICKS into Ned's chair, right 
               between his legs.

               Lola flashes a coldly arrogant smile at Laura... then exits.

</b>
               Max enters through the vestibule, without his cigar, stopping 
               in his tracks when he sees Ned. He smiles to himself, then 
               ducks back into the lavatory.

<b>               INT. LAVATORY - DAY
</b>
               Max looks at himself in the mirror. He's a disaster. He opens 
               the violin case, pulling out his trademark "Ned Ravine" gray 
               suit on a hangar. It's not even wrinkled.

<b>               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY
</b>
               Ned looks pale... sweating... reacting tensely to every lurch 
               and bump the train makes. The feeble Old Woman strains to 
               pull her huge steamer trunk down the aisle, inch by inch, 
               toward Ned.

<b>               ANGLE ON FRANK AND LANA
</b>
               Lana peers over the seat, watching Ned with a cruel smile.

<b>                                     LANA
</b>                         It's already getting to him. He'll 
                         be out of that seat and into the 
                         vestibule within ten minutes... I 
                         guarantee it.

<b>               INT. LAVATORY - DAY
</b>
               Max is cleaned up, dressed in the suit. He straightens his 
               tie, slicks his greasy hair back, sticks a big cigar in his 
               mouth and grins at himself in the mirror.

<b>                                     MAX
</b>                         You talkin' to me? You talkin' to 
                         ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?

               He reaches into the violin case, pulls out a complex 
               assortment of metal parts, assembling them swiftly. CLICK... 
               SNAP... CLUNK! It's an incredibly nasty looking high-tech, 
               automatic weapon with gigantic cartridge clip.

               He screws on a long silencer and points the gun at the 
               ceiling. POOF!... a muffled gunshot! Debris fall around him. 
               He looks up. He has blown a HOLE through the roof of the 
               coach.

               He adjusts the Silencer Volume Control, which has a scale 
               from 1 thru 11. He turns it all the way down to "0"... DEAD 
               SILENT. He pulls the trigger. The gun RECOILS, but there is 
               absolutely NO SOUND! He has blown another HOLE in the ceiling.

<b>               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY
</b>
               Ned looks across the aisle to see a GROSS SLOB pulling all 
               kinds of strange food items from a paper bag, making a big, 
               sloppy, disgusting SANDWICH that squirts and drips all over. 
               Ned turns away... really queasy now.

<b>               INT. LAVATORY - DAY
</b>
               Max reaches into the case, pulls out A BLENDER! He plugs it 
               into the outlet and REVS it a couple times, grinning wickedly.

<b>               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY
</b>
               Max steps out of the lavatory and sees the CONDUCTOR coming 
               his way collecting tickets. He quickly spins around, slides 
               the door open and steps into the vestibule between cars.

               The Conductor can't get past the Old Woman, so he climbs 
               over the top of her trunk, with no thought of helping her.

<b>               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY
</b>
               Max looks out the side window, trying to conceal the weapon 
               in front of him. The Conductor enters, sees him.

<b>                                     CONDUCTOR
</b>                         Ticket?

               Without turning, Max holds the ticket up over his shoulder. 
               The Conductor takes it, punches it, notices the gun barrel.

<b>                                     CONDUCTOR
</b>                         Sorry pal... automatic weapons are 
                         only allowed in the club car after 
                         nine p.m.

               Max turns, raising the gun with a nasty GROWL. The Conductor 
               casually snaps a baggage tag to the barrel, taking the gun.

<b>                                     CONDUCTOR
</b>                         I'll check it with baggage. You can 
                         claim it at the depot in Santa 
                         Barbara.

               The Conductor drops the weapon into a big mesh bag... along 
               with a dozen other guns he's collected. He exits. Max whirls 
               around facing the window, eyes filled with rage. Now what?

<b>               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY
</b>
               A gun barrel slowly protrudes between the seats in front of 
               Frank and Lana. Their eyes widen. Suddenly, a stream of water 
               hits Frank in the face! He sputters. A LITTLE KID named JEFF 
               scrambles into the aisle.

               Lana turns to Frank... inspired. She leans toward Jeff.

               Jeff bounces into the seat across from Ned.

<b>               ANGLE ON FRANK AND LANA
</b>
               Lana peers over the seat at Ned. She smiles.

</b>                         He's losing it. You better get up to 
                         the next car. Remember, give me the 
                         high sign as soon as you see the 
                         river. It'll be two minutes and nine 
                         seconds past the tunnel. I'll take 
                         care of the rest. Anything goes 
                         wrong... just make sure you back me 
                         up.
                              (grabs his collar)
                         And don't let him see you.

               Frank gets up, moves down the aisle slowly, eyes on Ned. He 
               can't squeeze past the Old Woman, who is still struggling to 
               pull her huge trunk down aisle. So... he climbs right over 
               the top of it... oblivious to her.

               Frank stares at Ned warily as he gets closer. Suddenly, Jeff 
               squirts a stream of water in Ned's eyes. Frank sees his 
               chance, rushing past Ned toward the vestibule.

<b>               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY
</b>
               Frank races through the vestibule behind Max's back. By the 
               time Max turns to see who's there... Frank is gone.

<b>               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY
</b>
               Ned wipes the water from his eyes, blinking. He grabs the 
               squirt gun away from Jeff, holding it up angrily.

<b>                                     NED
</b>                         This... is not a toy!

<b>                                     JEFF
</b>                         Yes it is.

               A beat. Ned realizes he's right. Acting tough, he pulls the 
               plug and drains the water out of the gun, then tosses it 
               back to Jeff.

               Without missing a beat, Jeff drops the empty water magazine 
               from the grip and jams a full one in... just like loading a 
               cartridge clip. He smirks, ready for action.

               In the aisle next to them, the Old Woman now pulls her trunk 
               back toward the vestibule. Jeff points the squirt gun at 
               her. Suddenly, she whips around and SQUIRTS HIM in the face 
               with her own squirt gun! He sputters!

<b>               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Max stares out the window, still seething. Behind him, the 
               Old Woman moves into the vestibule, inch by inch, trying to 
               drag her trunk into the first coach car.

               Max turns, sees her struggling and goes to her aid.

<b>                                     MAX
</b>                         Here... let me help you with that.

               He pushes the trunk into the first coach car, then very 
               politely holds the door open for her. She smiles sweetly at 
               him as she shuffles through.

               Ned turns queasy. The train lurches. He stiffens.

<b>               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               The Old Woman has unpacked her huge trunk. She has hung up 
               clothes... set out a vase with flowers... hung up a big framed 
               painting... and turned on a floor lamp. She pulls out a set 
               of dumbbells, pumps them a couple times... and drops them on 
               the floor with a loud CLUNK!

               Frank watches her from his seat across the aisle with a blank 
               expression... only his eyes moving.

               The Conductor punches the Old Woman's ticket, then holds out 
               his hand, waiting. She pulls out a Smith & Wesson .44 
               Magnum... drops it in his bag. He waits. She pulls out an 
               Uzi.

               few beats, then... LIGHT fills the car again as they emerge 
               from the tunnel. Lana looks. Ned is gone! She heads down the

               The Conductor is still tagging weapons as the Old Woman comes 
               up with a Ruger Mini 14 machine gun, a Mauser C96 automatic 
               handgun, a sawed-off double-barreled .12 gauge shotgun...

               Ned shoves the BANANA and two PLUMS into a demonstration

               Lana turns cool, dropping her courtroom facade. She plucks

               in and magically pulls out her bra, tossing it away.

               pants, the CAMERA MOVES TO Lola, who is watching Lana from 
               the back of the courtroom.

               Lola pulls a small cord hanging from the side of her hat... 
               opening her veil like window drapes. She's not happy.

               next to her, smiling diabolically. She lowers the gun.

               One of the Coroner's INVESTIGATORS approaches Arch and Ned.

               He holds up a rolled piece of paper with a pair of tweezers. 
               Ned takes it, trying to unroll it.

               Investigator slips, arms waving, and falls out of frame.

               She drags a chair in behind her, sits at the kitchen table. 
               Ned puts a kettle on the burner, turns it on. He starts 
               searching through the cupboard for teabags.

                              (lays them on table)
                         I found them in the pocket of that 
                         suit you wore the night you were 
                         working under cover with a client.

                         Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts 
                         with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L-
                         O... L-A. Lola.

               Ned turns to her when he hears Lola's name... looking baffled 
               by this convoluted piece of logic.

                         access to it beside you and me? The 
                         answer came up... Lana. And since 
                         she's a woman, it's probably hidden 
                         right here.

               A huge ceramic cookie jar sits on the table in front of them.

               The keyhole saw cuts through the railing. The CAMERA REVEALS 
               Lana, eyes filled with Machiavellian rage.

               She enters the bathroom, lays the saw blade down. Suddenly... 
               a PAIR OF HANDS plunge into frame, grabbing her by the throat!

               We GO WITH HER as she is pushed back into the tub, the hands 
               forcing her head under water. Lana grabs a diving mask, clamps 
               it over her face. One of the attacking hands rips it away! 
               Lana grabs a snorkel, sticking it in her mouth. The hand 
               pulls it from her, tossing it aside.

               The hand shoves a little RUBBER DUCKIE into Lana's mouth! 
               Lana struggles, finally going limp. Her open eyes stare up 
               from beneath the water. The last few bubbles rise to the 
               surface.

               The tea kettle WHISTLES! Laura pulls it off the burner. The 
               whistling subsides... replaced by the distant SOUND of water 
               running upstairs. Ned cocks his head, listening.

               Ned exits. Laura opens the Ovaltine container. It's empty. A 
               DARK SHADOW moves past the window behind Laura. Suspense 
               MUSIC. Laura opens the cupboard. PIGEONS explode out, wings 
               beating furiously! She catches her breath, looks in the 
               cupboard. The cans and boxes are covered with pigeon shit. 
               She shoves them aside, looking for the Ovaltine.

               duckie jammed into her mouth. The tub overflows on the floor.

               He turns the faucet off. The water stops... and so does the

               Laura steps back and turns... right into a THING covered in 
               white! Startled, she SHRIEKS! Ned drops the white towel he's 
               using to wipe off all of the shaving cream and toothpaste. 
               Relieved to see it's Ned, she throws her arms around him!

<b>                                     LAURA
</b>                         Oh Ned!

<b>                                     NED
</b>                         You were right... there's a million 
                         things I don't know about women. 
                         Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.

               He pulls out his police badge, looks at it.

</b>                         Hell... I had too many careers anyway.

               He tosses it away, over the railing.

               The badge drops from above, landing on the floor right in 
               front of Lola's lifeless face. A beat. Her eyes pop open!

</b>
               Suddenly, the rubber duckie pops to the surface.

<b>               ON THE LANDING
</b>
               Laura hugs Ned again, arms locked around his neck, still 
               gripping a gun in each hand.

<b>                                     LAURA
</b>                         Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved 
                         you!

<b>               INT. FOYER
</b>
               Lola sits bolt upright, bloody but still bouncy.

<b>               INT. BATHROOM
</b>
               Lana suddenly SITS UP in the tub, inhaling a huge GASP of 
               air, her eyes wild!

<b>               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
               Laura's Husband's eyes POP OPEN! He SITS UP suddenly... 
               smashing his head into the sharp corner of the kitchen table! 
               He topples back slowly... really dead! Finally.

<b>               INT. THE STAIRCASE
</b>
               Lola's feet move steadily up each stair... her bloody hand 
               grasping the ice pick.

<b>               INT. BATHROOM FLOOR - LOW ANGLE
</b>
               Lana's feet step out of the tub, water dripping all around. 
               She picks up the pointed saw from the floor.

<b>               ON THE LANDING
</b>
               Ned and Laura still embrace, her forearms crisscrossed behind 
               his neck. It's been a long embrace.

               Suddenly, Lana and Lola both appear, SCREAMING like banshees!

               Lana charges from the bathroom, grasping the sharp saw blade! 
               Lola races at them from the stairway... with the ice pick!

               Without missing a beat, Laura raises the barrels of both 
               guns and FIRES at them simultaneously... right next to Ned's 
               ears.

               The impact of one bullet knocks Lana all the way back through 
               the bathroom, CRASHING spectacularly out the window! The 
               other bullet sends Lola flipping down the staircase!

               Ned looks stunned, his eyes crossed... the thundering gunshots 
               still ringing in his ears. Laura proudly blows the gunsmoke 
               away from the end of each barrel.

               He strains to make out what she's saying, ears still ringing.

</b>
               A beat. Laura opens her mouth to correct him, then decides 
               against it. She smiles... speaking softly, almost shyly.

<b>                                     LAURA
</b>                         Okay. But I want to have kids.

               He hears THIS... smiles at her.

                         with pieces that never seem to fit

               Ned and Laura are in bed, wrapped in each other's arms.

</b>                         All I know is, there are three things 
                         that men can't possibly ever do...

<b>               NEW ANGLE - NED AND LAURA

               Revealing that it's NOT "voice over narration." Ned is 
               actually rattling on aloud again.

                         and program a VCR. And giving birth 
                         is the easy one.

</b>                         Knock off the chatter, will ya?

               He smiles at her. They kiss. Romantic SAXAPHONE MUSIC begins 
               to play... only this time, it's "Laura's Theme."

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... revealing Dizzy laying on 
               the bed beside them... playing the sax.

               After a beat, Laura turns to Dizzy.

</b>                         We won't need you anymore.

               Ned casually slips him a twenty dollar bill. Dizzy slips off 
               the bed and out the door. Laura turns to Ned.

<b>                                     LAURA
</b>                         We can make our own music.

               Her hand reaches slowly over the edge of the bed, toward the 
               floor. Suddenly... she comes up with a CONCERTINA, a small 
               accordian... and begins to play it!

               Ned lays there listening for a few moments, a stunned look 
               frozen on his face. Then... he reaches under the pillow and 
               pulls out a HARMONICA and joins in.

               The CAMERA BOOMS UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT... as they play 
               MEDLEY of all the MUSIC heard in the film.
