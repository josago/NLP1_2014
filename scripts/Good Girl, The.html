</b>                         (v.o.) As a girl, you see the world 
                         like a giant candy store, filled with 
                         sweet candy and such. But one day you 
                         look around and see a prison and you're 
                         on death row. You wanna run, or scream 
                         or cry. But something's locking you 
                         up. Are the other folks cows, chewing 
                         cud till the hour come and their heads 
                         roll? Or are they just keeping quiet, 
                         like you... Planning their escape?

                         is a hand lotion. So don't put it anywhere 
                         else, even if you need lubrication. 
                         We try to keep frivolous lawsuits to 
                         a minimum, unless, ofcourse, the customer 
                         is at fault. Here's your change and

</b>                         I was thinking about what you were sayin' 
                         about my sperm bein' low. I mean, I 
                         know I got good sperm. It's baby-makin 
                         sperm. I suppose it couldn't hurt to 
                         have it confirmed by an expert.

</b>                         Dear Justine. Because of you I'll be 
                         quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last 
                         two days have been the most god-awful 
                         days of my life. I've not been able 
                         to get rid of you in my head. I never 
                         wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted 
                         many things. I'd given up long ago on 
                         being gotten by someone else, and then 
                         you came along. The idea of being gotten, 
                         because of circumstance, will never 
                         get got is the worst feeling I've ever 
                         felt, and I have felt many bad feelings. 
                         I'm sorry I can never see you again, 
                         Justine, forgive me for being so weak, 
                         but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden 
                         Wurther. If for some reason, you could 
                         change your mind and want to be with 
                         me, body and soul, meet me after work. 
                         I will be waiting for you at five PM 
                         outside Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not 
                         there at five, you will never see me 
                         in your lifetime.

</b>                         Holden gave me two of his stories to 
                         read. It's like what a story would be. 
                         I was about a boy who was put upon, 
                         his mother was cold and selfish, and 
                         his father wanted him to play football. 
                         Other people didn't get him, especially 
                         girls. Then the boy comes to believe 
                         no one can ever really know him. So 
                         he starts actin' out, drinkin', and 
                         doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end 
                         the boy kills himself but jumpin' over 
                         abridge. The second story was pretty 
                         much the same as the first. Except at 
                         the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' 
                         a bottle of bug poison.

                         terrible and shocking news. One of our 
                         best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday. 
                         Gwen was a real class act. She had a 
                         good attitude, she had ideas. We're 
                         all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y'all 
                         need to collect you thoughts and remember 
                         Gwen. GWEN, then today's the day. You'll 
                         be excused from work and we'll just 
                         have to do without you. Gwen, this one's 
                         for you.

</b>                         Holden had the notion to go to Gabler's 
                         Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love. 
                         He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin' 
                         around around in the sticks and the 
                         dirt and bein' one with nature. He was 
                         so fixed on the idea thateven when the 
                         clouds started rollin' in, and the sky 
                         was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'. 
                         All my thoughts turned to death. I thought 
                         of Gwen's body, rottin' away. I thought 
                         of how nice a person she was, so full 
                         of life and good will. If there was 
                         a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin' 
                         makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice. 
                         I thought if I died today, what would 
                         happen to me? A hateful girl. A selfish 
                         girl. An adultress. A liar.

</b>                         You know why.


<b>                                     JUSTINE
</b>                         Bubba sat like that for what seemed 
                         like ten years before he began to speak. 
                         Finally, when he opened his mouth, he 
                         talked a blue streak about the ruin 
                         that was his life. He talked about how 
                         he loved Phil, and how he loved me. 
                         And how he always wanted a girlfriend 
                         just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, 
                         to this imaginary girl like me, that 
                         he never found. Then he wen on about 
                         givin' up your dreams and how it's all 
                         a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given 
                         up on his dream to be like Phil, and 
                         accepted his fate as Bubba, always and 
                         forever. Then, last week, a door that 
                         remained shut swung wide open. Bubba 
                         thought this no chance coincidence, 
                         a cosmic force was at work. The sounds 
                         of me makin' love to a man that wasn't 
                         Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear 
                         from the creator himself. What it meant, 
                         or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. 
                         All he knew was that he hated me for 
                         poisoning the well of idealism that 
                         he had drunk from for so long. I was 
                         no longer Bubba's image of perfection. 
                         To him I was just a liar, and a whore, 
                         and that sickened him. But on the other 
                         hand he loved me for opening his eyes 
                         and releasing him from the bitter chains 
                         of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil 
                         was no superman, just a cuckhold, and 
                         a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba 
                         felt that there was just one thing left 
                         for us to do. Something that would solve 
                         both our problems and end this whole 
                         tragic cycle.

                         could take care of him. Otherwise, he's

                         devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the 
                         corner on my left, the motel was down 
                         the road to my right. I closed my eyes 
                         and tried to peer into the future. On 
                         my left I saw days upon days of lipstick 
                         and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and 
                         quiet whisperings. and burning secrets 
                         that won't ever die away. And on my 
                         right, what could I picture? The blue 
                         sky, the desert earth streching out 
                         into the eerie infinity. A beautiful, 
                         never ending nothing.

                         As most of you all know by now, We lost 
                         another employee yesterday. Holden was 
                         a thief and a disturbed young man, and 
                         what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps 
                         we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, 
                         like don't steal and don't be disturbed. 
                         The important is to move on. Like dozens 
                         of those who quit. This one's for you 
                         Holden.

                         was about a woman who was put upon.
