Down you go
It's just a job I do
                             Genesis
                             Just a Job to Do


You wanna be a detective? Here's what you
do: Take a trusted friend, and imagine the
worst thing, the most despicable thing, the
thing it would never even cross their minds
to do. Then assume they've already done it
twice.

                             Private Investigator



When you consider that a career in pro foot-
ball means maybe ten years, after which you
got no legs left, and during which you're a
painkiller drug addict, a million a year
sounds about right. So when people bitch
at me about the money I made, I have a pat
response: Go fuck yourself.

<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. DARK BEDROOM
</b>The only light, that of a flickering TV screen.
A big MAN lies, shirtless, on the bed.
Watching a sports program. We hear:
<b>                         SPORTS FIGURE (V.O.)
</b>                  (on TV)
           Eliminating the draft? Worst
           thing ever happened to pro
           football. Already you got Eric
           Dickerson, no team's good enough
           for him... You got Dion Sanders,
           this guy, Bosworth, bunch of
           peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him
           play for 25 bucks a game. And he
           woulda played for free, you get
           me? He loved the game. Nowadays?
           Forget about it.
The TELEPHONE SHRILLS in the stillness.
The Man On the Bed answers it. Speaks haltingly.
<b>                           MAN ON BED
</b>           Hello...?
<b>                           MALE (V.O.)

Silence.

<b>                         MALE (V.O.)
</b>           Kid from Ohio is looking real
           good, Billie...
The Man's hand unclenches. A container of pills spills
over the blanket. He stammers:
<b>                         MAN ON BED
</b>           I'm... I'm gonna... try real
           hard...

           ... is rush for 150 yards against
           Chicago.
<b>                         MAN ON BED

         business, Billy.  You don't make
         one fifty, you're history, the kid
         steps in. No more  job... and no
         more pills, Billy.
<b>                       MAN ON BED
</b>         Please... Just give me time...
<b>                       MALE (V.O.)
</b>         One hundred and fifty yards.
         Goodbye.
The PHONE CLICKS off. NFL running back Billy Cole stares
straight ahead, mouth working spastically.
<b>                                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>AERIAL SHOT - SNOWSTORM
</b>OVER Chicago, Illinois, as the CAMERA SPIRALS DOWN TOWARD
a teeming football stadium. We hear crowd noise and
marching band music, deafeningly loud, as we SUPERIMPOSE
the legend:
<b>         SOLDIER FIELD, CHICAGO   NOVEMBER 14
</b>
<b>INT. ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH
</b>The BROADCAST TEAM huddles inside the quilted jackets,
squinting through the snow. Speaking into headset mikes.
<b>                       ANNOUNCER
</b>         Good afternoon and welcome to
         Soldier Field, Chicago, site of
         today's confrontation between the
         L.A. Stallions and the Chicago
         Bears. This is Vern Lindquist
         with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my
         friends, it is that cold.

<b>INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>Billy Cole sits, alone, in front of his locker.
Eyes glazed. Face bathed in sweat.
He takes a bottle of pills from the locker. Pops three.
Hisses a stream of air through his teeth as we --

</b><b>EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (FOURTH QUARTER)
</b>A deafening CRUNCH as a defensive back hammers a wide
receiver, nearly decapitates him. The ball rolls free.
The back recovers it.
<b>                       ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>         ... Big Ray Walton puts a
         devastating hit on Bricmont, so
         Chicago turns over the ball with a
         minute and forty seconds left.

<b>EXT. SIDELINES - SAME TIME
</b>The injured player goes by on a stretcher, moaning.
Cheerleaders jump and frolic.


<b>BILLY COLE
</b>gets up off the bench. The rest of the offensive unit
sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead,
eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the
soundtrack.
<b>                       COLOR MAN (V.O.)
</b>         And so L.A. has a chance to ice
         the game, no pun intended... And
         you gotta be thinking, give the
         ball to Billy Cole. He has had an
         outstanding day, racking up 138
         yards against a tough defense.

<b>DOWN ON FIELD
</b>The huddle breaks.
The L.A. team trudges through the snow to the line of
scrimmage.
Cole adopts a three-point stance.
Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION:
The snow falls. The receivers breeze past, in motion to
begin their patterns. Moving like gazelles.
Cole's fingers paw the cold earth. Gouging it.
He is like a spring. Coiled and ready.
The ball is snapped.
Turf and snow. Erupting.
A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide.
Legs churning.

</b><b>                                                       4.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to
Cole.
He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm.
Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled.
Cole turns the corner. Picks up a blocker.
Feet pounding. Arms pumping.
Up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him.    Low and
hard.
Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey.
Pulls out a GUN.
Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head.

The bullets go straight through. On the back of his
helmet.
A mixture of blood and fiberglass.
Cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone.
Around him, sound. Fury. Impact. Confusion.
Another defensive back. Straight ahead.
Reacts with almost comical terror. Dives to one side.
Cole FIRES. Blows out the guy's knee. Ends a career.
Keeps going.
We are now in full-scale panic.
The players are fleeing the field. Shouts. Pandemonium.
A few brave men gather around the fallen players.

<b>POLICE
</b>are on the field now. Running full out. They've got
riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the
snow.
Cole crosses the goal line.   Touchdown.
Drops the ball.
Turns, facing the cops.   His eyes are insane.
The crowd is screaming. People are running back and
forth like extras in the Keystone Cops.
The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and
wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost.
The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing
like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice.
Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him.    He
smiles and says:

<b>EXT. L.A. STREET - IN SHADOW OF FREEWAY - MORNING
</b>We SUPERIMPOSE the legend:
<b>       WEST LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA    DECEMBER 20
</b>Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at
sea. Welcome to another lackluster morning in Southern
California. Palm trees limp. Windless silence. 80
degrees at 8:00 AM.
CAMERA CRANES DOWN PAST a huge, rotting billboard. On
the billboard, a girl in tight jeans. Grabbing her own
butt. A surprised look on her face. Yes, honey, that's
your butt.
MOVE IN ON a tiny, weather-beaten bungalow. In the
shadow of the 405 Freeway. A shingle hangs from a
wrought iron post: JOSEPH R. HALLENBECK, CONFIDENTIAL
<b>INVESTIGATIONS.
</b>On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth.
The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo.
Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams
V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music.
Picture the  tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch
self-hating  loser you can.
Now give him  a two-year-old suit from C & R Clothing.
Such is the  aforementioned HALLENBECK.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car.
Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk.
One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his
nose.

<b>                       KID #2
</b>         Shit, we should do something to
         him.
Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs.   It looks like his
entire fist is up there. Pause, then:
<b>                       KID #3
</b>         I know where there's a dead
         squirrel.


<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - BUNDLE OF PAPER TOWELS - SOME MINUTES
</b><b>LATER
</b>with a tail sticking out.
The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently.
Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck.
Still snoozing.   Dead to the world.
<b>                        KID #1
</b>         Do it.
They heave the squirrel into the car and run away.
A pause. Another pause.    The sprinkler goes round.
Nothing happens.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his
chest. A shadow falls across him as --

<b>KIDS
</b>return, scratching their heads.   Staring in at him.
<b>                        KID #2
</b>         Goddamn.   Dude's trashed.
<b>                       KID #3
</b>         Take his bottle.
Kid #1 smiles nervously.   Reaches in with infinite
patience.
Trembling hand inches closer and closer --
And closes on the bottle as, without warning --
<b>
</b><b>                                                       7.
</b><b>HALLENBECK
</b>sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38
revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Hey, motherfucker.
The Kid, of course, shrieks.
And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes.
He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid.
Swears under his breath. Watches    the boys flee in
terror. Notices a dead squirrel    in his lap. Scowls.
Heaves it out the window. Pumps    a Camel into his mouth.
Lights it. Rescues the bottle of    Seagrams.

Thus begins his morning.
He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him.
He gets out. Stands on the lawn.
One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the
sidewalk.
<b>                       KID #3
</b>         I'm not scared.
Hallenbeck scowls.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         You're on my property, kid.
<b>                       KID #3
</b>         Sidewalk belongs to the
         government.
Hallenbeck stares at him.   Smiles weakly.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Excuse me.
He leans over and vomits on the lawn.
One hand gripping the car fender.
The sprinkler goes round and round.

<b>EXT. MALIBU BEACH FRONT - MORNING
</b>A redwood beach house, mellow in the morning sun.
There was a party here last night.
Banners. Balloons and streamers. Tawdry in the light of
day.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        8.
</b><b>INT. BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIME
</b>A plush bedroom.   Sun streams in the window.
A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair.     Bare-
foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan.
He is nursing a beer.   Smoking and staring at --

<b>BED
</b>where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent.
Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast
exposed. No tan line.
The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the
sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old,
former National League heartthrob.
He shakes his head and mutters:
<b>                       JIMMY (YOUNG MAN)
</b>         Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so
         damn ugly.
He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass
vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it
up a nostril.
For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror.
<b>                                           FLASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>FLASHBACK - FOOTBALL FIELD
</b>Seventy thousand people screaming.
Jimmy in the middle. Younger Jimmy.    Fresher Jimmy.
It's a night game at the Coliseum.   He's the quarterback.
The snap. Jimmy fakes the draw. Rolls right.      Around
him, all is impact. Sound and fury.
He targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket.   Sixty-
yard toss, hits the guy between the numbers.

<b>JIMMY'S FACE
</b>Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too.
Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's
alive. He makes a difference.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      9.
</b><b>BACK TO PRESENT
</b>Alone in the bathroom... leaning on the counter.    Head
down. A voice calls softly from the bedroom:
<b>                       SLEEPY VOICE (O.S.)
</b>         Jimmy, are you still here...?
Pause, then:
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         I don't know.
He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard
stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes.
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         Yeah.    I guess I am.
He sniffs, clearing his nose.

<b>INT. WEST L.A. BUNGALOW - MORNING
</b>Hallenbeck opens the door and shambles in.
Dark. Depressing. Sprawl of furniture. Stack after
stack of sports magazines. Drop all your belongings out
of a plane. They will land like this.
He flicks on the light. Crosses to the couch and flops
down. Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table.
Next to the bottle, we see --

<b>TWO FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS
</b>side by side. In one, younger Hallenbeck is kissing
younger bride. Smiling.
In the other, the President of the United States presents
Hallenbeck with a medal. They are both smiling beneath
the Presidential Seal.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>Hallenbeck scowls and chews three aspirin.    Swallows.
The PHONE RINGS. He groans. Chain-lights another smoke,
stubs out his old one. Chins the receiver and says:
<b>                       HALLENBECK

         if you can   manage it. Look the
         part. Not    like the last time,
         okay?
Hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over
the TV. His face is ashen grey. Hollow eye sockets.
Blotchy skin.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Gimmee the address.


<b>EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING
</b>Hallenbeck emerges into the blinding glare. His tie is
crooked. His cuffs are too short. He looks like a
grouchy bear.
He looks up at the girl on the billboard.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         'Morning, gorgeous.
Gorgeous does not respond:   Coy.   Very coy.
Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth.     KEYS
the IGNITION. Phil Woods' SAXOPHONE fills the air.      He
looks at himself in the mirror.

         Nobody likes you. Everybody hates
         you. You're an asshole and you're
         stupid. You're gonna lose.

         Smile, you fuck.
He stretches his mouth into a grimace.
Pulls out into the street. Off he goes.

<b>INT. MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
Jimmy Dix leaves the bedroom. Pads barefoot down a hall
littered with beer cans, food wrappers. A sleeping guy.
Stops at a door, peeks in: all-night poker game in
progress. Four bleary-eyed men. Unshaven. Stack of
wrinkled money on a card table.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         'Morning, boys.
They all grunt. One of them, name of HENRY, looks up at
him. Holds out a half-smoked doobie:
<b>                        HENRY
</b>         Hey, Jimmy.   You want some of
         this?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         No, man. Why do you think they
         call it dope?
                (beat)
         Henry, did I do anything last night
         that I should know about?
<b>                       HENRY
</b>         You puked a couple times. Pointed
         at some lady's tits. Chased a dog
         for a half an hour. Fucked a
         congressman's daughter, shit on
         someone's car.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         No, man, I meant something bad,
         that I should know about.

</b><b>                       HENRY
</b>         Mmmm.  Nope.
                (frowns)
         My ass hurts, I think I had gay
         sex last night. I don't remember.
         When are you gonna come look at
         my gun collection?
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         Soon, Henry.
One of the other PLAYERS looks up, says:
<b>                       PLAYER
</b>         Are you Jimmy Dix? Played for the
         Stallions?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         '86 and '87, that was me.
<b>                       PLAYER
</b>         Hell, I think the league gave you
         a raw deal.
<b>                        JIMMY
</b>         Thanks.   What the hell, shit
         floats.   I'll be back.
<b>                         PLAYER
</b>         I hope so.
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         I'll be back.
Everyone plays cards.    No one looks at him.   He frowns.
Leaves.


<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
</b>Jimmy is seated in the devastated living room. Putting
on shoes. He hears a COMMOTION outside: A woman scream-
ing. Water splashing. He frowns, puzzled. Gets up.
Pads out onto a redwood deck.

<b>EXT. REDWOOD DECK - SAME
</b>A six-foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end
of the deck. He is dunking a terrified female head under
the water and laughing.
Jimmy clears his throat.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                        JIMMY
</b>         Ho.    Ray.
The MAN looks up, annoyed.
<b>                       RAY (MAN)
</b>         What the fuck you want, Jimmy?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         What's with the girl?
She surfaces, sputtering and screaming.   Ray thrusts her
beneath the surface again.
<b>                       RAY
</b>         Bitch won't blow me.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>                (pause, then)
         Too early in the morning, Ray.
         Let her go.
<b>                       RAY
</b>         Fuck you. She's not coming up
         till she starts blowing.
Jimmy swallows hard.   Says:
<b>                        JIMMY
</b>         Ray.   Let her go.
<b>                         RAY
</b>         Fuck   you, loser. What are you doing
         at a   league party, asshole? You and
         ol'   Dex Manley should get together,
         swap   stories about gettin' booted.

Jimmy controls himself with an effort.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Ray, she's gonna drown.
<b>                       RAY
</b>         Not if she blows me.
Jimmy's eyes are smoldering. He steps to the right.
Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Last chance, Ray.
<b>                        RAY
</b>         Go spit.

</b><b>                         JIMMY
</b>         Fine.
Jimmy turns, as if to walk away.
Instead, he spins back and launches the football.
It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it
smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the
ball.
The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose.
The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking.
Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the
water.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Get out of here. Go.
She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair.
The guy is bleeding. Delirious.
Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Best arm in the National League,
         you son of a bitch. Remember that.
He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious.
The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside.

<b>EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>Jimmy gets into the car. Takes out his vial.
Spoons some powder, sucks it up.
A voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car!"


<b>EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</b>Joe Hallenbeck slides his Plymouth to the curb in front
of a cozy stucco dwelling. Gets out, crosses the lawn.
A fat NEIGHBOR is watering shrubs next door. He waves.
<b>                       NEIGHBOR
</b>         'Morning, Joe, how's it going?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         My ears are burning, Andy. Even
         as we speak, someone, somewhere is
         calling me an asshole.
<b>                         NEIGHBOR
</b>         You're funny.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.
<b>
</b><b>                                                     16.
</b><b>INT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
</b>Hallenbeck enters and crosses the living room.
A woman, forty-ish, once beautiful, appears in the bedroom
doorway. Wearing a terry cloth robe. This is Joe's wife
<b>SARAH.
</b><b>                       SARAH
</b>         I thought you were in Las Vegas.
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         I was.
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         Where did you sleep?
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         Office.
He brushes past her and crosses to the bed.   On the pillow,
a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Hey, Furry Tom.
He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night
stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to
load the gun.
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         How much did you lose?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         I wasn't there to gamble.    I was
         doing a skip trace.
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         How much did you lose?

<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         Fifty bucks.
He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand.
A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns:
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         What's this?
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         Darian's class drew holiday
         pictures. That was hers. Her
         teacher wants to see us, Joe.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       17.
</b><b>CLOSE ON DRAWING
</b>It's a picture   of Santa Claus,  except this Santa has long,
stringy hair,   bloodshot eyes,  and grotesque talons. A
little girl's   severed head is  clutched in one hand.
Underneath, in   block capitals,  is written: SATAN CLAUS.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b><b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Satan Claus. Kid's got some talent,
         don't you think?
<b>                         SARAH
</b>         It's hideous.

Her voice is ice cold.    Joe turns and regards her levelly.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         You okay, Sarah...?
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         I'm tense. I couldn't get to
         sleep last night.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid
         will be fine. Boys still tease
         her about the headgear?
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's
         the latest. Little bastards.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>                (under his breath)
         She'll be fucking them by the
         time she's fourteen.
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Well, Christ, you let her wear
         enough makeup. The kid looks like
         a goddamn raccoon. She comes in
         late at night, I think, 'Christ,
         a burglar.' I almost shot her
         twice.
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         You're not funny. All the girls
         at that school wear makeup.

<b>                       SARAH
</b>         Go live with them.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Don't tempt me.
He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed.   Stalks into
the bathroom.


<b>INT. BATHROOM
</b><b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>         Damn raccoon.
He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet.
Walks back out into the bedroom.

<b>INT. BEDROOM
</b>He kneels, looks under the bed.
Frowns.
Straightens and says, very conversationally:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Who's the guy in the closet?
Sarah stops dead.   Spins and stares at him.

<b>                         SARAH
</b>         Excuse me?
<b>                       HALLENBECK

         Oh, that's right, you sometimes
         forget that I'm a detective.
                (lights a cigarette)
         See, first I noticed how tense you
         were, but I let that pass. Then
         I noticed there was steam in the
         shower like someone was just in
         there, but meanwhile your hair is
         completely dry, you follow? So.
         Why the steamy shower?

</b>         Because someone else was in there,

         the closet when you heard my key in
         the door a day early. Tah-dah.
         Please, no applause.
A silence hangs between them.    Sarah just stares.   Shakes
her head.
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         Well, nothing changes.    You're

<b>                       HALLENBECK

An awkward pause.   Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:

He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger.    And Sarah
screams --

And grabs the gun.
Everything freezes. She looks at him.    He looks at her.
Understanding occurs.

<b>CLOSET DOOR

And out steps a man in a bathrobe.
Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet.
None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call.

           It was an accident. Sure. You

                  (sighs)
           You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts.
He pulls the trigger.
The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room.
Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself.
The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head.
On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the
one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead
center.
Blows it to pieces.
Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor.
Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless
eyes.

</b>Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb.
Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard.
Holsters his gun.
A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail.
Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur.

         Gut.
Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back
foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's
gut.
Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch.
Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it.

</b>Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to
his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask.
He walks back toward the hedge.
The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth.
Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird.
Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it.
The DOG BARKS and bounds after it.
Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition.
The CAR BLOWS to pieces.
An ERUPTION OF FLAME.
Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne.
Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down.
The shockwave catches Hallenbeck.   Slams him ass over
teacups.
Windows blow in up and down the street.
Smoke and fire roll to the sky.
The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear.
Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire.
Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and
leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed.

stiffly. Not looking at each other.

<b>NAKED, GYRATING BODY
</b>Female, for the record.   Signaling us that we are now:

<b>INT. "BOTTOMLESS PIT" CLUB - NIGHT
</b>Rowdy strip club in   West Hollywood. Just like the      name
suggests; if it's a   virus, you're sitting on it.      After
three drinks, every   girl on stage looks like your     high
school sweetheart.    Was your sweetheart fat? Did      she
have excessive body   hair?
FUNK MUSIC, played LOUD. The Monday crowd stomps and
claps. Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm
usually reserved for standing in line at the DMV.
Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling. Behind
the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks. His
name is HARP.
Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old BEANPOLE speaks
into a microphone:
<b>                       EMCEE (BEANPOLE)

Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast.

Harp raises his own glass.

It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy
drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely:

         I don't remember what I did  last
         night. I'm an idiot, Harp,   I act
         like a complete dickhead.   I don't
         have friends. I drink too   much.
         I fuck anything that's warm  and
         breathing.

She stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a
Seagrams V.O. in a rocks glass.
Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad
suit. The essence of boredom. Looks like he's been
there three days. A cloud of smoke hangs around his
head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less.

Jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table.

Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin.
It never gets there.
Joe moves, lightning quick, and suddenly Jimmy's fist
is trapped. Dead stops. Fingers grinding into palm.
Jimmy swears. Stumbles. Sits down hard.
Hallenbeck releases him.

          You were a great quarterback, Jimmy.
          I watched you play at Washington

          Followed you with the Stallions.
          Good scrambling ability, seventy
          percent completions from the

Cory and Jimmy are engaged in very hot sex.
This is not a love scene; this is a sex scene.
Sigh. I'm not even going to attempt to write this

reasons:
A)   The things that I find steamy are none of your damn

B)   The two actors involved will no doubt have wonderful,
     highly athletic ideas which manage to elude most

<b>INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
</b>Joe Hallenbeck is pounding an already-dented cigarette
machine. No dice. It has eaten his money. He shakes
his head, muttering.
Looks at his watch. Looks at the dressing room door.
Shakes his head again. Walks to the end of the corridor.
Goes through the fire door. Out into:

<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Starry, moonlit night.   A chill breeze.   Joe draws a
breath.
In front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster:
BAYNARD FOR SENATE, it reads. Above the logo, a picture
of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man.
Hallenbeck regards it balefully.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         I didn't vote for you, you bastard.
He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the
ground:
A half-smoked cigarette butt.
Just sitting there.
Joe stares at it. Thinks it over.
Starts to walk away. Stops.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         You're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>He bends to pick up the butt.
A steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches.
Hallenbeck spins, startled. Reflexively lashes out with
a flattened palm. Misses, chops the air.
Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go.
A sap pops him behind the left ear. A sickening thud.
The world spins out of focus. He goes down.
Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks.
Rolls over, staring up.
Vision muddy, indistinct.

<b>HALLENBECK'S POV
</b>
Three silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps.
Their voices are fuzzy.
<b>                          HITMAN #1
</b>           That's him.   He was with her.
<b>                         HITMAN #2

<b>                         HITMAN #3
</b>           Get him away from here.   Then kill

<b>                         HITMAN #2
</b>           There's no contract for him.
<b>                         HITMAN #3
</b>           Then do it for free. Just do it
           elsewhere.

The men disperse. One of them drags Joe to his feet.
A stocky, crag-faced man. He jams a silenced pistol
in Joe's kidney and points him toward a vacant lot
nearby.
<b>                         HITMAN #2
</b>           Start walking. I'm right behind
           you.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model
sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the
nightclub.
Waiting.

</b>A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule-
vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car.
A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to
drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell.
Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot.
The crag-faced man follows behind him.
<b>                       CRAG-FACE (HITMAN #2)

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         She said her husband was a

</b>         You're pretty cool for a guy gonna
         take a bullet.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         After fucking your wife, I'll take

The hitman wheezes laughter.   Joe just grins.

         You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap
         her thigh and ride the wave in.
                (the hitman loses it)
         Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except
         when you poke her in the stomach,
         she farts. I got a buddy he's an
         archaeologist, organized an
         expedition to her chin. They got
         lost in her nasal hair. But
         seriously, her eyes are like the
         streets of Paris: crossed.
         They're so crossed when she cries
         the tears run down her back.
         She's got back-tearia.

From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of
gravel at the man's eyes.
The man cries out. Stumbles backward.
And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring. Not drunk at
all. He takes  the broken bottle he's been clutching and
cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter.
The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face.
Blood bubbling.
FIRES the GUN once, into the ground. Drops it from nerve-
less fingers. Stares at Hallenbeck, aghast.

Hallenbeck meets his gaze.    A savage, feral gleam in his
eye.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         And then some.
The guy pitches over dead.
Hallenbeck kneels beside him.
Retrieves his .38, holsters it.       Slips the hitman's pistol
into his waistband.

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.
He takes off running.

Watching Jimmy and Cory.
The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car.
In his lap is an automatic rifle.

<b>EXT. NIGHTTIME STREET - SAME TIME
</b>Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag.
Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero.
Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging. Humming with
JOE COCKER on the RADIO.
Cory comes to a red light.    Pauses.   Turns right onto a
sidestreet.
Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection.


<b>GRAY SEDAN
</b>passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING.
Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car.
It's enough:
Everyone inside is armed to the teeth.
The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of

Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:

Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:

And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn --
And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy.
He takes a running start.
Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap.
BULLETS DICE the metal behind him.

He lands, hard.   Sucks the ground.    Huddled behind his
car, as:

<b>TWO HITMEN

The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without
warning --

<b>JOE HALLENBECK

He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING.
One Hitman dies immediately:
Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire.
Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD.

The second Hitman turns and OPENS UP on Hallenbeck.
Too late. Joe rolls behind a mailbox.
BULLETS chase him, blowing apart the metal box.
The Hitman swears. Turns, running for the sedan.
He knows when a getaway is in order.
Just one problem.     He forgot about Jimmy Dix.
A SCREECH of TIRES.
As Jimmy's Jag slews around the corner, laying rubber.
Rockets toward the Hitman, pins him in its headlights --
The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him --
And CRUNCHES into the gray sedan.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Shatters the Hitman between the two cars...
And holy Christ, the guy's still alive.
Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken...
He raises his rifle, screaming.
Jimmy dives flat on the front seat.    The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS.
The Hitman.   Still pinned.   Still screaming.
He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy's car.
Hallenbeck walks up behind him.
Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming.


<b>JIMMY
</b>is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken
glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         Hey.
                (as Jimmy looks up)
         Back up.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up.
Steam pouring from the crumpled hood.
The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street.
Like a sack of flour.

Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing.
He stops as:

<b>MOTEL MANAGER
</b>stands outside a door marked OFFICE.
Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck.
Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         It's all over, compadre.
<b>                       MANAGER

         Sidewalk belongs to the government.
He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain.
Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed.
Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered
Hitman. Kneels  down, fishes through the guy's coat
pockets. Comes  up with a bloody pack of cigarettes.
Extracts one.  Lights it.
SIRENS fill the air.
And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his
coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it.
Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight.
No one sees him do it.

<b>POLICE CRUISERS
</b>come SQUEALING up, flashers turning.
Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless --
And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon.

<b>INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</b>SERGEANT BENJAMIN BESSALO sits behind his desk, scanning
a stack of typed pages. A tired-looking cop named McCASKEY
lounges in the doorway. A Christmas tree in the corner
sheds needles.

Through the glass window, we can see Hallenbeck and Jimmy
seated outside in the squad room proper. Bessalo stops
reading. Sniffs the air. Frowns:

<b>INT. SQUAD ROOM - SAME TIME

Outside the office Hallenbeck and Jimmy are perched side
by side on a wooden bench. Jimmy is crumpling pieces of
paper and tossing them at a wastebasket. He throws with
unerring accuracy. Beside him Hallenbeck frowns, deep in
thought. Finally, Jimmy speaks:

office.
                       McCASKEY
         Okay, you guys are cleared to go.
         Pick up belongings at the property

As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors,
they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to
her pimp.
There is a heated exchange.     The pimp slaps her.   Hard.
Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward.     Balling his fists.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         That son of a bitch!
He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck
grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front
doors.
Away from trouble.

He STARTS the CAR.

Joe taps the brake.    Stops.   Leans out the window, says
softly:

</b><b>EXT. ADULT LIVING COMPLEX - NIGHT
</b>Jimmy and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk
between tiny, palm-shaded cottages. The moon casts a
pale glow.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Bet these places run a fortune.
<b>                       JIMMY

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Wasn't like that. Cory could've

<b>                       HALLENBECK

</b>         Yes, massah.

<b>INT. COTTAGE
</b>Jimmy opens the door.   Flips on the lights.     Stops in
his tracks.
The room has been systematically torn to pieces.
A knife has been used to rip open the couch.
Broken furniture, shredded clothing. Everywhere.
It looks like a combat zone.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         I think someone disturbed some
         stuff, Joe.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Bathroom. You wanna come with me?

         anything heavy.
<b>                        HALLENBECK

</b><b>INT. CLUTTERED BATHROOM
</b>Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him.
He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc.
Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard
deodorant.
Turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom.
Inside, the can is hollow and empty. The perfect hiding
place.
Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. Removes a little plastic
Baggie filled with white powder. Stashes it in his
shorts.
Starts to replace the lid. Stops. Frowns.
Reaches into the can a second time --
And pulls out a yellow envelope.
He looks at it, perplexed.
Puts it in his pocket. Replaces the lid. Tosses the can
on the floor. Flushes the toilet. Leaves.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>Hallenbeck, meanwhile, is prowling the living room,
looking at photographs on the walls.
The girl in the photos seems young, beautiful, and naive.
One shot depicts Cory and a friend in cheerleader outfits.
On it is scrawled, GOOD LUCK IN HOLLYWOOD BABY! LOVE,
<b>JANIS
</b>Hallenbeck gazes around the devastated cottage.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

<b>EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>The two men emerge from the house. Joe heads for his
car. Jimmy peels off toward a battered GMC Pacer parked
at the curb.

<b>                       HALLENBECK

<b>                       JIMMY

Hallenbeck starts to turn away.      Jimmy gets in the car.
Hallenbeck stops. Frowns.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Cory has two cars?
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Yeah. This one's just sitting

The color drains from Hallenbeck's features.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>         Jimmy, no!!
He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the
driver's seat before he can key the ignition.

</b>Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting
in the moonlight.

Jimmy pales noticeably.

Hallenbeck claps him on the back.

</b>         Easy, kid. No harm, no foul.     We

He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling.
Cheerfully unaffected.
Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard.
Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other
way.
<b>                       JIMMY

Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.

Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass.

rings out suddenly from the darkness.

One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy.
The other carries a silenced Beretta.

</b>Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside
of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the new
arrivals.
The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties.
One is tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and
stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional
mob hitters.
The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady.
<b>                       TALL MAN

Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun.

Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels.
Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut.

         You like that word?

         Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing

Another fist to the head.   Hallenbeck grunts.   Spits more
blood.

Jake steps forward.

<b>                         HALLENBECK

Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips:
<b>                       HALLENBECK

Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze.    Speaks softly.

<b>                       HALLENBECK

He turns and throws the keys as far as he can.
They fall out of sight behind a cottage.

</b>         You dumb bastard, you're going to
         pay for that. Jake, open the
         trunk.

Jake steps forward, drawing a .38 silenced pistol.
He is going to shoot open the lock.

<b>ANGLE ON HALLENBECK
</b>This is what he's been waiting for. He tenses, looking
to one side: next to him is a sloping hillside, angling
down and away. He grips Jimmy's wrist, signalling to get
ready.
Jake raises the PISTOL.    Take aim at the lock and FIRES.
The SHOT is SILENCED.    What follows is not.
Because the bullet blows through the trunk --
And hits three sticks of live dynamite.

<b>SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
Hallenbeck is already moving, pitching to one side,
throwing himself and Jimmy down the hillside.
The night lights up like a SUNBURST.
A tower of fire...
Climbs up and outward from the car.
The TRUNK LID is BLOWN fifty feet in the air.
The tires are pulped.
GLASS SPRAYS for fifty yards in every direction.
And, most importantly:    both hitmen are engulfed in
flame.

</b>SOUND. Fury.
Flames, rolling skyward.
TINKLE of raining GLASS.
Bits of falling metal.
All in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:

<b>JIMMY AND JOE
</b>continue to careen down the hillside.
Bouncing like rag puppets. Out of control.
Lurch to stop at the bottom.
Covered head to toe with dirt.      Bruised.   Bloody.
Alive.
They lie side by side, sucking air --
Until they both hear an odd noise:
The sound of CRUMPLING METAL.
The sound is GETTING LOUDER.
They both crane their necks in time to see --
The flaming car, tumbling end over end
Coming down the hill.
Heading straight for them.
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>            Jesus fucking Christ!

They both dive for cover, out of the way.
Barely make it.
The CAR plows past them in a shower of dirt.
CRUMPLING. Heaving. Spitting fire.
Finally SLAMS to a halt against a palm tree.
Burns.
The night is filled with SHOUTS and CURSES.
The sound of DOORS OPENING. The crackle of flames.

<b>ON GROUND
</b>Joe rolls over.    Looks at Jimmy.    Jimmy looks at Joe.

</b>         If you thought there was dynamite
         in the trunk, wait'll you see this.

Both are older, distinguished-looking.
Joe suddenly looks very pale.
<b>                       JIMMY

         It's fucking vomit, okay? This is
         bad.
Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette.
Stares straight ahead through the windshield.   Begins to
talk:
<b>                       HALLENBECK

         way home from a late session. I'm
         on the highway just outside of
         Georgetown when I see something
         up ahead.

<b>MEMORY FLASH
</b>Another time. Another night.
A younger-looking Hallenbeck.
Rugged features. Clipped military haircut.
He is driving.
Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist.
Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog:


<b>WRECKED CAR
</b>is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass.
He SCREECHES to a stop.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he approaches the overturned
car.
There are two dead bodies inside.
A woman. A little boy.
In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with
suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is
splattered with blood.

         and the boy were dead. The driver
         of the other car wasn't.

<b>STAGGERING DRUNK
</b>is weaving toward Hallenbeck.
Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes.
He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers.   Silk tie.
<b>                       DRUNK

         father, he'll take care of it.
The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck.
Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes.
He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand.
<b>                       DRUNK
</b>         You'll tell 'em what happened,

         time. He was  standing there, not
         a scratch on him. I went a little
         nuts. I hit  him.
In SLOW MOTION, Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk,
with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips. Breaks
teeth.
We see the Drunk's head slowly strike the asphalt.
A sickening concussion.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

</b>           Even when he came out of it, he
           was never right in the head. His
           dad fixed everything with the cops.
           The accident report disappeared. A
           week later the police found half a
           kilo of crack cocaine planted in
           my house. Acting on an anonymous
           tip.
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>           The senator fucked your job.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>           And my pension. And my marriage.
           Only reason I'm still licensed to
           carry a gun, the man himself made
           a few calls. Since then I'm just
           playing it out. Day by day.
Jimmy is silent for a moment.   Then:
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>           Cory tumbled to some sort of deal
           between Marcon and the senator,
           and they had her killed.
                  (beat)
           We gotta show this photo to the
           cops.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>           Not yet. I need more evidence.
                  (beat)
           I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to
           bring him down. I could use your
           help.
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>           Why should I help you?
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>           Because if Baynard takes a fall, so
           does Marcon. The man who kicked you
           out of professional football.

</b><b>INT. PLUSH BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>A tall, thin, almost effeminate MAN is seated on a couch.
High cheekbones. A shock of blond hair.
Glittering, malignant eyes.
He is directing a pornographic film.

<b>PRETTY GIRL
</b>is bound hand and foot to the posts of a lavishly
appointed bed. Around her, the room is filled with
Kleig lights. Reflectors. Camera equipment.
The girl is scowling furiously.    She speaks to the
director:

<b>                       GIRL
</b>         I want the sheets changed, Milo.
<b>                       MILO (MAN)

A strident BEEPER GOES OFF on Milo's belt. He turns to
the two-man crew and claps his hands for attention.

The closet door opens. A hulking man emerges.
He is carrying a chainsaw.
The Girl on the bed stares, incredulous.

</b>            Easy, Pablo.   She's not a piece

He exits.    Closes a sound-proofed door behind him.

<b>INT. WOOD-PANELED STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Milo enters, all business.
Crosses to a telephone with a blinking light.
Stabs a button. Scoops up the receiver.

<b>EXT. HALLENBECK HOME - LATE NIGHT

Dawn is a ghost on the horizon as Jimmy parks the rental
Subaru outside. The two men emerge. Head for the front
door.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         So I get to meet your family, huh?
         What's your daughter like?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         She's like thirteen. And if you

         an umbrella up your ass and open
         it.

<b>INT. HALLENBECK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>As they come through the front door, Joe's daughter,
DARIAN, is slumped in a big Lazy-Boy, staring sullenly
at a movie on TV. Cute kid, cursed to wear ridiculous-
looking dental headgear.

She doesn't bother to look up.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         First things first. I'm starving.

</b>She still won't look at him. The two men cross to the
kitchen. Hallenbeck opens the refrigerator, takes out
some lunchmeat.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         She's pissed off because I wouldn't
         let her go out on a date with her
         friend Billy.
<b>                       DARIAN

<b>                       HALLENBECK

         Because she's thirteen, that's why.
                (to Darian)
         I bought you some ice cream.
<b>                       DARIAN

         It's chocolate chip, your favorite.
<b>                         DARIAN

Without missing a beat, Hallenbeck opens the window
and heaves the ice cream outside.

Hallenbeck   crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of
Seagrams.    Swigs.  Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks,

hands with   George Bush.

</b>         Ooooooh.     Very deep.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         It means another drink is required.
He raises the bottle.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Alex the accountant.
He drinks.   Hallenbeck frowns, watching him.

         Alex was my son.
Hallenbeck stares at him.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         I was married at 19. Sweet young
         thing, looking to get out from
         under daddy's thumb. I didn't
         know she was a junkie. All during
         her pregnancy. Shooting up. There
         were complications. She died.
         Alex lived for seventeen minutes
         in the incubator. Fell asleep.
         Died before he woke up.
                (takes a drink)
         He was born... He had time for
         one dream... and then he died.
         I wonder what his dream was
         about.

He exits.    Hallenbeck watches him go.     Says nothing.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Jimmy enters and shuts the door. Turns on the shower.
Makes no move to undress.
Instead, he reaches inside the waistband on his pants.
Removes a vial of coke. Dips a spoon.
The door opens.
Hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh
towels. He stops. Staring at Jimmy. They freeze in
tableau.
Then Hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides
and slugs Jimmy with all his might. Decks him.
The kid goes over backward into the shower, head striking
the porcelain. He swerves. Claws his way out, drenched.

Joe drops the vial in the water. Flushes.
Jimmy darts forward. Joe shoves him back.

He grabs a towel.   Scrubs savagely at his wet torso.

</b>         Why, Joe? Why is there an injury
         report in pro football, huh...?

         killed the last thing I could do,

He collapses against the wall.
Slides down to a sitting position.   Huddled on the floor.
Hallenbeck watches him. Says nothing.
For a moment, he seems moved to compassion...
Then his gaze hardens. He kneels next to Jimmy.

Joe's daughter, Darian, is standing there.

There is an awkward pause. Darian holds out a football
card.
Young, smiling Jimmy.
The card is old. Tattered.

</b>         If you want my help, I'm at the
         Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura.
He exits. Shuts the door behind him.
Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door.

Joe is alone.    He turns.   Sees his reflection in the hall
mirror.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAWN
</b>The first light of day streams through the window.
Hallenbeck pushes Furry Tom to one side.
Sits on the bed.
Regards his sleeping wife with hooded, lifeless eyes.
She is peaceful. Serene. He reaches out to touch her.
Stops. Withdraws his hand.
Crushes out the cigarette. Stands. Leaves.

<b>INT. DARIAN'S ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
Hallenbeck enters. Crosses to Darian's bed.
She is asleep. She looks vulnerable. Helpless.
He leans over and kisses her.
She stirs in her sleep.
Murmurs:
<b>                         DARIAN

Hallenbeck recoils.
Stares at her.
The DOORBELL RINGS.
Startling him. He mutters under his breath.
Stalks out of the room.

hair. The man removes a TASER GUN from his overcoat.

</b>         Good morning, Joseph.
He FIRES point-blank.
The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest.
A CRACKLE of electric current. Hallenbeck jerks
spastically.
The world spirals away.
He plunges down into darkness.

<b>INT. CLUTTERED APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>Jimmy looks bad.
Sprawled out on a tangle of dirty sheets.
Jeans. Bare feet.
Smoking.
Staring at a football card.
A duplicate of the one Darian showed him.
He swings his legs off the bed.
Stands, crushes out his cigarette.
Moves into the bathroom.
The Baggie of coke is on the counter.
He stares at it with bloodshot eyes.
Swallows hard.
Acts before he can think.
Grabs the Baggie. Tosses it in the toilet.
Flushes. Watches as it goes down the drain.

<b>EXT. CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - MORNING
</b>Another Goddamned day.
A chill drizzle. The palm trees look forlorn.

</b>Jimmy buys a paper. Trudges along Ventura Boulevard.
Huddled against the chill.

<b>SLEEK, BLACK SEDAN

Two men get out:
One is Pablo, who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in
Milo's snuff film; the other is an ugly piece of hired
muscle who we'll call CHET.
The two men flank Jimmy and walk alongside him.
He looks up, startled.

<b>                       PABLO
</b>         Get ready, kid. This one's an E

And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms.
Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence.

They toss Jimmy over the fence.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances.
In this case, however --
A fifty-foot drop...

Awaits him beyond the fence.
A huge, looming pit dug into the earth.
Foundation for a new parking garage.
Jimmy plummets like a stone.
Under normal circumstances, he'd be dead.
But since it rained last night, he's got three feet of
water to land in.
He hits with a splash.   Disappears beneath the water.
Surfaces, screaming in pain.
Thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down
does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his
skin at a crazy angle.

</b>His million-dollar arm.    His throwing arm.

Huddled in a pool of muddy water.
His screams of pain ECHO in the chill, morning air.

         Christ, Joe wasted the bastard

He stabs a button on the phone.   Barks into the receiver:

</b>         I want an A.P.B. out on Joe
         Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and
         if he resists arrest, shoot the

He slams down the phone.   Stares, stricken, at McCaskey.
<b>                       BESSALO
</b>         I let him go, Mick. He wasted Mike

</b><b>JOE HALLENBECK'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE
</b>Weathered.   Sallow.   Dark circles under the eyes.

<b>HAND
</b>comes INTO FRAME and slaps him.    Hard.
Rocks his head to one side.

<b>INT. ELEGANT BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Thick carpet. Polished, wood furniture.     Window walls.
Outside, the sea is angry and grey.


<b>PABLO AND CHET
</b>are standing over Hallenbeck, who is slumped in a chair.
Both hitmen wear holstered sidearms.
Chet leans over and slaps Hallenbeck again.
The big detective begins to stir.
His eyelids flutter.
<b>                       CHET
</b>         I think he's awake.
<b>                         PABLO
</b>         Make sure.
Chet's hand flashes out for a third slap --
And from nowhere, Joe Hallenbeck's hand magically
appears.
Intercepts the blow.
Clamps onto Chet's hand and wrenches it.
A cry of pain.
Chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>         I'm awake.
His eyelids creak open.
He squints, adjusting to the light.
Studies his captors.
<b>                       CHET

</b>He starts pawing his coat pockets, looking for a cigarette.
In the corner, Pablo chuckles:
<b>                       PABLO
</b>         Milo warned us to watch out for
         this guy.
Chet is seething.     He glares at Hallenbeck.
Hallenbeck yawns.
<b>                      CHET
</b>         Fuck that. Look at him. He's
         nothin'. Guy's a piece of shit.

Hallenbeck ignores him.     Sits up.   Rubs tired eyes.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Anybody got a cigarette...?
Chet steps forward.     Grins wickedly.
<b>                          CHET
</b>         Sure, buddy.     I got a cigarette.
He reaches into his shirt pocket. Extracts a Marlboro.
Hands it to Hallenbeck. Takes out a lighter.
Hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips.
Leans forward for a light --
And Chet slugs him in the face.
The cigarette goes flying.
Hallenbeck's head snaps back.
Blood creeps from his lower lip.

<b>                       CHET

         Hey, baby, I thought you were
         tough. See, Pablo, he ain't so
         bad.
Hallenbeck's eyes glint fiercely.      He takes a breath.
Leans forward and says:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         I seem to have dropped my
         cigarette. May I have another?
Chet turns, meets his gaze.     The grin falters a bit.
<b>                        CHET

Hallenbeck puts it between his lips.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

                (beat)
         And if you touch me again... I'll
         kill you.
A pregnant pause.
The challenge hangs in the air.
Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket.
Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features.
Hallenbeck leans forward for a light.
Chet extends his arm --
And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again.
Rocks him.
Chet howls with laughter.
Pablo grins.
<b>                        CHET
</b>         Baby!   Two for two!
The laughter continues.
Hallenbeck takes a deep breath.
Stands up.
Strikes with a flattened palm.
Breaks Chet's nose.
Drives it up into the brain.
Chet stands, pole-axed. Blinks once.
Pitches over dead.

And suddenly Pablo isn't laughing.
He stares at Hallenbeck, incredulous.
Stares at Chet, lying on the carpet.

</b>At that moment, a door opens, and Milo enters.
Slick. Well-dressed. Utterly composed.

         He killed Chet, Milo. The mother-
         fucker just killed him!
Milo looks toward Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck says nothing.
Instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up Chet's
lighter from the carpet. Lights his cigarette. Blows
smoke.

A tense moment... and then Milo does something un-
expected: He starts to laugh. Advances into the room,
chuckling.
<b>                       MILO
</b>         Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph,
         Joseph, you don't disappoint me.
He draws a Walther PPK and approaches Hallenbeck.
Smiling and cheerful.
<b>                       MILO
</b>         You seem to have killed one of

Milo nods as if this makes perfect sense.

<b>                       MILO
</b>         You took an awful risk. Pablo

         please take Chet's corpse into
         the other room, and then fix Mr.

Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway:
<b>                       VOICE (O.S.)
</b>         Make that two.
Hallenbeck turns toward the new arrival.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Hey, look who's here. Connie
         Marcon himself.
Sure enough, CONRAD MARCON saunters in, just like he owns
the place. Which, by the way, he does. Tall, strong,
Texas-tough. Dressed in a Saville Row suit. He frowns
at Hallenbeck:
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         Careful, son. Only my friends
         call me Connie.

</b>         They're having some problems.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         They stink.
Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment.
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         I'm glad you're here, Joe. We
         got a few things to discuss.

He takes a moment to gather his thoughts.
<b>                       MARCON
</b>         For starters, I'm sure you're
         aware that professional football
         is changing, and not for better.
                (lights a cigar)
         Used to be, you went to the local
         stadium come Sunday, you saw
         heroes. Guys who fought for
         their hometown. Anymore, no one
         gives a shit. Ever since Sonny
         Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe
         Namath back in '66, the sons of
         bitches just got greedier.
         Playing only for themselves.
         Giving nothing back to the game.
Pablo hands him a double bourbon.

<b>                       MARCON

            Just one.
He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway.
Reappears a moment later.
He's got Joe's wife.


<b>ANGLE ON HALLENBECK
</b>He stands. Face contorting. Fists clenched.
Rage courses through him like an electric current.
Marcon cocks his gun.
<b>                          MARCON
</b>            Sit down, Joe.
A moment.    Joe stands, smouldering.   On fire.   Sarah
speaks:
<b>                          SARAH
</b>            Do what he says, Joe.
Joe sits. Breathing shallowly.
Eyes locked on Milo.
<b>                          HALLENBECK
</b>            Are you alright, Sarah?

<b>                         SARAH
</b>            Yes.
<b>                          MILO
</b>            That's a temporary condition,
            Joseph. As you may be aware,
            there are distributors in Mexico
            who positively crave snuff films.
            And unless you do every fucking
            thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your
            wife will make her motion picture
            debut.
He meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles.

</b><b>INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
</b>Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless,
on a metal examining table. His ribs are taped. His
arm in a cast.
Two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces:
Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo.
Jimmy shakes his head, exasperated:
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Look, I'll say it again for the
         cheap seats: I don't know
         anything and I can't help you.
         Okay? Can I go now?

Bessalo grimaces in disgust.
<b>                       BESSALO
</b>         Let me get this straight: you're
         walking along, minding your own
         business, when two guys you never
         met jump you and throw you in a
         ditch for no particular reason.

         Tell me where Hallenbeck is.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         How the fuck should I know?    Try

         Look, Sergeant. I don't give a
         shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just
         busted my throwing arm and I'm
         in a real pissy mood, so you got
         two choices: either charge me
         with something or let me the fuck
         outta here.

</b><b>EXT. CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - DAY
</b>The grey day wears on.
Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment
unit. Pulls up short, staring ahead --

<b>DARIAN HALLENBECK
</b>Slumped outside the door to his apartment. Asleep.      A
crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand.
He kneels beside her.    Touches her shoulder.
<b>                         JIMMY
</b>         Hey.    Wake up.

She stirs. Awakens, looking at him.
Her eyes are puffy and red from crying.
Her hair is a tangled mess.
She hands him the piece of paper, and promptly bursts
into tears.
Buries her head in his chest, sobbing.
He cradles her with his good arm.
Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads:
<b>                MOMMY AND DADDY ARE WITH US
</b><b>        CALL THE POLICE AND WE'LL KILL THEM BOTH.
</b>He stares at the note, dumbstruck.

<b>EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
</b>A savage wind sweeps in off the ocean.
Gulls wheel overhead.

<b>FORTY FOOT YACHT
</b>is tethered to a wooden dock outside the beach house.
Milo and his crew prepare to cast off. Meanwhile:

<b>PABLO
</b>approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an
Izod shirt.
He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck.

</b>They are seated on the dock.
Each handcuffed to a metal railing.
Pablo kneels and unfastens Joe's cuffs.
<b>                        PABLO
</b>         Get up.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Go fuck yourself.
Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs.
Hallenbeck gasps in pain.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         I meant that... in a good way...
Pablo hauls him to his feet.    Props him against the
railing.
<b>                       PABLO
</b>         Time for a little payback, Joe.
         Call it a service to dear departed
         Chet.
He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle.
Sarah cries out in alarm.
<b>                       PABLO
</b>         How's that feel, fuckhead?

</b>                (weakly)
         I'm asshole... she's fuckhead.
And with that, Pablo lets him have it.

Rains punches on his chest and gut.
Slams an elbow into his kidneys.
Drives a knee into his groin.
Joe hits the deck.
Milo calls out from the boat:
<b>                        MILO
</b>         Easy, Pablo.   I want him conscious.
Pablo is kicking Joe's prone form.

</b>Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick. Spits on him.
Hallenbeck vomits. Lies bleeding on the dock.
Sarah crawls over to him. As far as the cuffs will
allow. Cradles his head in her lap.

                  (strokes his hair)
           I love you, Joe.

Hallenbeck looks at her like she's just grown three
heads.
<b>                         HALLENBECK

</b>           Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything

A pause.   Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh.

</b>         Must be my trick ear. Sounded
         like you said, 'Get me out of
         this.'
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         You can take these guys, Joe.

<b>                       HALLENBECK

He stares up at her for a moment.      Then, through bloody
lips:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Fuck you, Sarah...
And he smiles.

Just then, Milo signals from the boat.
Seeing, this, Pablo approaches the couple again.
<b>                       PABLO
</b>         All right, lovebirds, break it up.
He yanks Sarah to her feet.
Lets his gaze roam up and down her body.
<b>                         PABLO
</b>         Nice tits.
He rips open her blouse.   Roughly fondles her breasts.
Hallenbeck. On the ground.
He growls with fury. Starts to push himself up.

At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock.
Whistling cheerfully.
<b>                          MILO
</b>            Careful, Pablo. We don't want to
            get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in
            front of hubby.
He squats next to Joe.
<b>                          MILO
</b>            Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time
            to go, and remember: you follow
            orders, or the missus pays the
            price.
<b>                          HALLENBECK
</b>            You're gonna kill us both anyway.
<b>                          MILO
</b>            Perhaps. But there are ways to
            die, and then there are... ways to
            die. Capisce? You determine your
            wife's fate.
He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet.
Propels him toward the boat.
As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out:
<b>                          SARAH
</b>            Joe...!

He stops.    Turns.   Looks at her.
Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark:
Tiny. Fizzling. Almost gone.
But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly
kindles --
And eight years melt away.
Just like that.
The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and
says, with deadly calm:

</b>            You're wasting my time, Joseph.

Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired.        Unshaven.   Bloody.
He looks at Milo... and grins:

</b>            If you touch me again... I'll kill
            you.
They stare into each other's eyes.
Hallenbeck does not give an inch.
Milo hits him again.

People with six-figure incomes.
Pretending they're important.
Mingling. Schmoozing.

A sudden commotion near the front door.
FLASHBULBS POP. People crane their necks.
Marcon turns to look, as:

Hallenbeck says nothing.

Nudges up to the dock.
In the chalet above, the party rages.

<b>SERIES OF SHOTS - JIMMY'S PREPARATION

Jimmy lashes the boat.
Goes below.
Grabs a tuxedo from the closet.
Stands, dressed, in front of the mirror.
Opens a box. Removes a 9 millimeter Baretta.
Works the slide. Jacks a bullet into the cylinder.
Stashes it in the waistband of his pants:
In back. Concealed by the tuxedo.
Studies his own grim face in the mirror.

A voice calls out:

He turns, and sees Darian Hallenbeck.
Peeking her head out from under a tarpaulin.

</b>         At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard

         suitcase. This suitcast.
He opens one of the cases.   Hallenbeck stares.

<b>HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS
</b>Twenty thousand of them, to be precise.   Neatly bundled.
<b>                       MILO

         to sink the craft.

         And when we place your charred

Island lights blink in the distance. Fog rolls in.
Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck.
Crosses to the railing, looks down at:

<b>FISHING BOAT

A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them.
Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son.

</b>         Goddammit, now I gotta call the

</b>         Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast

Looking for a back entrance.
He hears VOICES, approaching.

<b>INT. MILO'S YACHT - CABIN - SAME TIME
</b>
The payoff is in progress.
One of Milo's crewmen carries the suitcase over to the
wall. Places it on a built-in counter. Underneath the
suitcase is a half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Off to one
side is a half-empty coffee container.
The case is opened.   Greenbacks galore.
Baynard's Aide whistles softly.
Examines the stacks of bills. Nods, satisfied.
<b>                        AIDE
</b>         Okay.   We're cool.
Just then Milo enters the cabin.   Adopts a harsh New York
accent as he angrily barks:
<b>                       MILO
</b>         Hey! Any of you stupid fucks
         bother to frisk this goombah?
<b>                       CREWMAN
</b>         No, sir, we didn't think --
<b>                       MILO
</b>         Exactly, you didn't think!
         Goddammit, that's two million

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>As Baynard's man assumes the position --
Milo hits a concealed button.
It happen in less than a second: the built-in counter
rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an
indentical counter.
Identical half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Identical coffee
cup. And, of course, the identical suitcase.
The indignant Aide turns around, pat-down concluded.
<b>                        AIDE
</b>         Okay?   Satisfied?

Milo smiles apologetically.
<b>                       MILO
</b>         We're cool, baby.
He hands over the suitcase.

<b>BACK TOPSIDE
</b>Baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase.
Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat.
Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there.
They cast off the lines.   Freeing the two boats.
<b>INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE
</b>Milo watches, tense.
As the lines are freed, he says:

<b>                       MILO
</b>         Hard to starboard, get us out of
         here. Back off a hundred yards
         and wait for the blast.

<b>INT. SENATOR'S CABIN - SAME TIME
</b>The go-between heads   below deck, carrying the suitcase.
Senator Baynard puts   down his wine glass.
Looks up, expectant.
The Aide flashes an "A-Okay" grin.
Sets the suitcase on a table. Meanwhile --

<b>INT. JIMMY'S SPORT BOAT - BRIDGE
</b>Jimmy has had about enough.    He sighs with frustration.
Stares ahead into the fog.

</b>          All we're doing is burning gas.
          Sorry, kid, I'm turning back.
The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a
throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up
puzzled.
<b>                        DARIAN
</b>          Do you hear that -- ?
And with that --

</b>
bursts from the fog.
Directly in front of them.
Hovers like an avenging angel, TURBINES SCREAMING --
<b>                        JIMMY
</b>          Holy fucking shit!
Rotor wash sprays in every direction.
The noise is deafening.

<b>INT. AIR ONE - COCKPIT
</b>The PILOT grabs the mike and shouts into it:
<b>                        PILOT
</b>          Code yellow, code yellow, we got
          a bogie, repeat, we got a bogie,

Grabs the mike:

</b><b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Jimmy's BOAT ROARS out of the fog...
And suddenly he's in a world of shit.
Less than fifty yards to port is Milo's yacht.
Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer.
<b>                          JIMMY
</b>          Oh, wow.    We're fucked.
He GUNS the ENGINE.     Spins the wheel, banks to port.

<b>AIR ONE
</b>screams past, cutting across the bow, nearly taking off
the roof --
Jimmy, wrestling the wheel, and meanwhile --

<b>INT. BAYNARD'S CABIN
</b>The Senator actually has his hands on the suitcase to
open it, when one of his MEN yells:
<b>                         MAN
</b>          Shit!   Something's going on.

The guy relays the order, and:

<b>EXT. HIGH SEAS
</b>Baynard's Marlineer surges forward.
Full throttle, heading for shore, as --

<b>EXT. MILO'S YACHT
</b>Milo skids out on deck, grabbing for his machine gun.
Calls out:
<b>                        MILO
</b>          Who the fuck is he?
A crewman grabs a pair of binoculars.       Meanwhile --
<b>
</b><b>                                                     125.

</b>Hallenbeck has no fucking idea what's going on, but he
can hear everthing that's said, as:

<b>BACK ON DECK
</b>the Crewman lowers the binoculars in disbelief:
<b>                        CREWMAN
</b>          Son of a bitch! It's Dix, the
          Goddamn quarterback!

<b>INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT
</b>
Hallenbeck's face goes through various stages of shock.
It's nothing compared to when he hears:
<b>                        CREWMAN (O.S.)
</b>          There's a little girl with him!
With that, he goes berserk.
Draws his legs back, thunders them against the compart-
ment doors. Kicks with all his might. Over and over
like a crazed horse, as:

<b>BACK TOPSIDE
</b>Air One does a flyby, circling, awaiting instructions.

<b>ON DECK
</b>Milo grabs the hand mike and says:

<b>                        MILO
</b>          Air One, Air One, follow the

          Okay, let's go. Full throttle.

<b>INT. YACHT - SAME TIME
</b>With a final, resounding crash, Hallenbeck kicks open the

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Works his bound hands over his knees so they're now tied
in front of him.
Everybody's topside; for the moment, at least, he is
forgotten.
He half crawls, half lurches over to the kitchen nook.
Worms beneath the table... awkward, desperate...
Drags out the can of gasoline.
Tries to unscrew the top.   No dice.   Can't get a grip.
Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side.
Brings his legs up in the air --
Slams them down on the can.
Over and over until, with a metallic pop -- ! it bursts.
Floods gasoline over the carpet, meanwhile:

<b>BACK TOPSIDE
</b>Milo's yacht is plowing ahead, gaining on Jimmy's
Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the
prow. OPEN FIRE.

<b>WITH JIMMY
</b>As he throws Darian to the deck, shields her with his
body.
The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE.
He grits his teeth. Reaches beneath his tux.
Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE, BAM -- BAM -- !
and meanwhile:

<b>INT. YACHT CABIN
</b>Hallenbeck is opening a box of kitchen matches with his
teeth.
Dozens of matches fall scattered on the carpet.
He releases the box. Bends. Picks up a single match in
his teeth.
Presses his face to the wall.   Gives his neck a wrench --
Lights the match.
He drops the match on top of the GAS CAN.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>A WHOOSH of combustion.    It bursts into flame.
Joe swivels around. Balancing on his backside.
Thrusts his legs into the fire.
Strains. Pulls. Sweat runs in rivers.
Until the ropes binding his legs snap.
He lurches to his feet, lets free.
Now there's only one problem: He's on fire.
The legs of his pants are soaked with gas.
Flames race up his legs.
He plunges headlong up the stairs.


<b>ON TO DECK
</b>where he hurtles toward the rail, dives --
into the sea, swallowed by the waves.
A CREWMAN suddenly screams:
<b>                       CREWMAN
</b>         Fire in the hole!
Fire, indeed.    It's a rapidly-spreading blaze.
The pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to
put out the fire, and meanwhile:

<b>HALLENBECK
</b>surfaces, gasping for air.    Trying to swim with his hands
tied.


<b>DARIAN
</b>spots him first. Sees her father bobbing like a cork in
the ocean, screams:
<b>                          DARIAN

Jimmy whirls around, startled.

</b>Jimmy spins the wheel. Banks hard to port.
Brings the boat around in an arc. Yells to Darian:
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Keep the wheel like this!   Don't
         let it move!
She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart-
ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached
to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling
hook.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Third and long, baby, lets' go...

And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm --
But, boy, does he heave that anchor.
It soars through space, chain playing out behind it...
Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck --
Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the
waves.

<b>EXT. MILO'S YACHT
</b>Milo, meanwhile, has also spotted Hallenbeck.
He growls in rage.   Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as:

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around
the passing anchor and whoosh -- !

He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet.
BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was.
He skims over the waves. Bounced. Battered.
Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour.
Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in.
Struggling. Straining.
The boat rushing headlong, driverless.
With a last, desperate surge of energy --
They drag Hallenbeck over the side. Into the boat.
<b>                        DARIAN

It steadily cuts the distance.

</b>Hallenbeck staggers to his feet.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Get below, Darian. And stay
         there.
He stumbles into the wheelhouse.   Dazed.   Barely
conscious.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Got any ideas?
<b>                       HALLENBECK

</b>         Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on.
Into the fog they go, and, folks --
This is really scary.
Because you can't see a foot in front of your face.
They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour.
Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield.

</b>And then a shape materializes off to port:
Milo's yacht.
Running alongside. Drawing closer.
Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel. No dice.
The yacht draws ever closer... men on deck... machine
guns...
Joe looks over... and his face tells the story:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         We're dead.
Except, just then, a strange thing happens:
Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from
Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         What the fuck? They're peeling
         off. Why?
A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         'Cause they got sonar, that's why!
         Hard to port!

</b>         Port?
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Left, Goddammit.
The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog --

The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Shit fuck piss!
They almost make it.
As it is, they avoid a head-on.   Instead, they hit
broadside.
A sickening CRUNCH -- !
Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet.
A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified
tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them.
Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls.
Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward --
Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles.
He swears violently.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         We're sitting ducks. They got

<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Kill the running lights and radio
         the Coast Guard.
Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he
does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him
to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges
from the fog --
And Air One hovers directly overhead.
<b>                        JIMMY
</b>         Fuck me.
The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends,
the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket.
<b>                        HALLENBECK
</b>         Get down!
They both hit the floor.    Hands over their heads --
And then the pilot makes a costly error:
He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht.
With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out
of the fog --
PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER.
Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it
to shreds.
Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix
erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night
into day.

Pause. They look up. Bewildered.
There was a big light... Big noise...
Why aren't they dead?

Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe.
Debris rains down.

Hallenbeck sees something in the distance.    Squints:

Jimmy looks:    A bright object... going in circles...

Speaks over his shoulder to Jimmy.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Hand me the pole.
Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end.

Swings it aboard. Drops it at Jimmy's feet.
The suitcase.

Steers the boat away from the crash site. Toward the

No need. It's a slaughterhouse.
The walls are perforated. Baynard and his men are dead.
The suitcase's evil twin lies unopened on the table.
Hallenbeck walks over to Baynard's lifeless body.
Stares into the wide-open eyes.

</b>Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark.       Deserted.
Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants,
nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin,

Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop.
Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points:

There is a man slouched inside. Smoking.

</b>The sour stakeout cop reaches for a job necessity: the
pot to piss in. He undoes his fly. Pees into an old

Opens the door to dump it out.
A hand reaches in, lightning quick.
Grabs the can, throws it back in his face.
As he jerks backward, blinded, the hand knocks him cold.

Hallenbeck moves hurriedly. Not a second to waste.
Pulls a dark turtleneck from a drawer.
Rips off the sleeve. Throws it to Jimmy.

He strips off his own shirt.   Crosses to the closet.

Clubs him in the head.

Beside him sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin.

<b>                       HALLENBECK

Bad.
<b>                       PABLO

Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it.
He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage.
Pity the fool.
Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes.
A thoroughly unnerving stare.

Then Joe does something very odd.
He says, softly:
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         We don't like Pablo very much, do
         we, Furry Tom...?

answers. A high-pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

         No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo
         is a motherless fuck who takes it
         up the ass.
Dead silence. Pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for
that matter... and then it hits us: Joe is doing ven-
triloquism.

And the funny thing is, he's really good.
Pablo overcomes his shock.
<b>                       PABLO
</b>         Shit, is he doing that?
Hallenbeck's face remains cold.    Expressionless.

Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes
the furry head bob back and forth.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

         I don't get mad. I get even.
And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens --
And EXPLODES, showering stuffing.
One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half
his throat is gone...
And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon
goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed
already --
Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas.
Pablo is a little sharper. A little quicker.
He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand.
Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut.
They reel across the room. Locked in combat.
Lamps topple. GLASS BREAKS.
Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall.   Leaves a dent.
Does it again, a sickening impact...
Starts to strangle Joe --
And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore.
He's not going to make it. The world swims away.
Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something
beside him... something hanging on the wall.
Fights to focus. Breath gone.    Strength gone.
Identifies the object:

</b>His Presidential Medal of Valor.
Shiny medal. Shiny ribbon. His name...
It hits him quite suddenly:
The medal has sharp edges.
With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the
wall. Drives it into Pablo's throat.
The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide. Gurgling.
He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely
from his gushing neck.
Drops to the dusty carpet.    Dies.

Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Eyes wide. Insane.
He is surrounded by corpses. He takes another deep
breath.
Picks up the sniper rifle.
Slings it over his shoulder.
Heads for the door.

Rifle over one shoulder. Hunting knife in a hip

Like an angel of death, he moves into the brush.
Heading down the canyon.

With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson.
He collapses, lifeless.
At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as:

He resembles nothing human. A demon in black.
Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his
arm.
Marcon reaches for the button to summon help.

</b>            Sorry, but that won't work. I
            don't care if he lives or dies,

A pause. Once more, Joe calculates the odds.     No dice.
He places the rifle on the desk.

            Joe.
Hallenbeck turns around... and, for once, his jaw drops.
He's looking at a man he never thought he'd see again. A
man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head
bounced off the Georgetown turnpike eight years ago.

</b>Son of the late senator. The right side of his face
doesn't quite match the left. The muscles don't work.
Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to
his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him. Two
gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid.   He snaps at
Baynard:

         of a golden opportunity: a chance
         to kill my father and frame you for

         It was I, unfortunately, who
         bought a forty-dollar bottle of

         freely to that hooker.

Jimmy chimes in:

</b>         See, Connie, every year, the mob

He once again looks Marcon in the eye.

A pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns --
And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm. Decks him.

</b>         Sure.   Slow and easy.
Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls
something out, concealed in his fist.
We see, but Marcon doesn't:
It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.

         See, it's one of those new plastic

And, with that, he hurls it into the fire.
So fast that nobody can see just what he threw.

The two hardguys rush to the fireplace.

One of them grabs a pair of tongs --
and the SHREDDER EXPLODES.
Sprays the two hardguys.    Cuts them to ribbons.
Then, several things happen at once:
Everybody goes for a gun.
Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol --
As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing --
Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM -- !
Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile --

</b>Baynard draws down on Jimmy, who picks up a flaming log
and hurls it, knocks the SHOT wild, as:

Blows him backward in a bloody spray.    Baynard sags
against the mantel. Collapses, dead.

corpses.
Jimmy snatches up a pistol. Joe slings the sniper rifle
over his shoulder. Stares at Jimmy:

<b>                         SARAH
</b>           I remember when we got married...
           My friends would talk about their
           husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my
           husband is a big-time publisher,'
           or, 'My husband is a brilliant
           lawyer...' I used to say, 'My
           husband can stand over a shotgun
           victim and eat a ham sandwich
           without puking.'
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>           Don't knock it. It's a skill.
She turns.   Looks into his eyes.
<b>                         SARAH
</b>           I want to try, Joe.   Do you still
           want to try?
A pause.   He leans in and kisses her tenderly.
And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights
rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing
light of a police flasher.
<b>                         HALLENBECK
</b>           Ahh, shit. Looks like the local
           constable has come to chat.
<b>                         SARAH

</b>He gets up, throws on a jacket.

<b>EXT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>Joe exits the office, starts across the lawn toward the
vehicle with the flashing light.
Realizes with a sudden shock:   something's wrong.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         That's not L.A.P.D....

<b>HALLENBECK'S POV
</b>
the insignia on the door panel reads LONG BEACH SHORE
<b>PATROL.
</b>In the same glance, he sees there's a dead cop slumped in
the passenger seat, and worse, much worse than that:
Milo is in the driver's seat.

<b>WIDER ANGLE
</b>Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly OPENS FIRE on
Joe.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         Son of a bitch!
He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as:


<b>INT. OFFICE - SAME
</b>Sarah sits bolt upright. Eyes panicked.    Terrified.
Darian comes awake, screaming:
<b>                       DARIAN
</b>         Mommy, what's happening?
Sarah leaps off the couch, cradling Darian and
meanwhile --

<b>EXT. OFFICE - SAME
</b>Hallenbeck spins behind one of the billboard support
legs, as BULLETS CHOP it to splinters.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       157.

</b>advances.
changing clips.    Methodical.   Precise.
Like a robot.
He is obsessed.    All vestige of sanity gone.
<b>                          MILO
</b>            You fucked up my face, Joseph!
Joe starts to climb. Scales the wooden structure.
Swings himself onto the raised platform.
Flattens behind the billboard.
<b>                          MILO
</b>            Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've
            got all night, you fucked up my
            face.
He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard.

<b>HALLENBECK
</b>huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch
upward. Through the wooden frame.
A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm.
An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain.
Rolls away from the gunfire.
Looks around. Desperate.
Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby.
He counts to three.


<b>DOWN BELOW
</b>Milo calmly changes clips.
Hallenbeck bursts from cover.
Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of
the billboard, hard and fast --
BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing
holes in Gorgeous's derrierre --
And then Joe does a risky thing:
He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full
tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he
doing?
<b>                                              (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>He's trying to make the freeway.
It's a good fifteen feet.   Try it sometime.
He flies through open air --
Milo's GUN CHATTERING below, seeking him out --
And just does make it.
Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming
as he rolls on his injured arm... Looks up --

<b>EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCK
</b>
is headed straight for him, bearing down...!
He rolls aside just in time. It THUNDERS past.
Staggers to his feet, frantic --
and Milo is climbing the billboard.
Hallenbeck looks for a place to hide.
There isn't any.
He's going to have to run through traffic.
He shifts from foot to foot, searching for an opening,
and meanwhile --

<b>INT. SUBARU - DRIVING
</b>Jimmy Dix is actually on the freeway, driving, when he
looks across the center divider and sees Hallenbeck.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         I don't fucking believe it.
He swerves over to the side and meanwhile

<b>HALLENBECK
</b>watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform...
Walks across the front of the billboard.
Toward the freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling.
Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground. Heaves it.
Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood
flows. All it does is piss him off.
<b>                       MILO
</b>         You ruined my flesh!

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Hallenbeck dives flat to the road as Milo opens up again,
a chattering BURST of GUNFIRE. The muzzle flash is
blinding.
The windshield of a passing car SHATTERS -- The driver
panics, the car spins out of control --
Slews across the road in the middle of traffic.
COLLISIONS. CRUMPLING METAL. EXPLOSIONS of GLASS.
<b>SCREECHING TIRES.
</b>
<b>CAR
</b>slides straight toward Hallenbeck.

He dives aside, rolls to his feet --
And he's right in Milo's sights.
My friends, the fat lady just sang.
Except another lady says different:
A single GUNSHOT SPLITS the air.
Milo's chest explodes with bubbling blood.
He shrieks. Turns, staring in disbelief at

<b>SARAH HALLENBECK
</b>below, on the lawn.     She aims Joe's service revolver and
says:
<b>                       SARAH
</b>         You just fucking die.

She FIRES again, and Milo reels backward.
Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard.
She DROPS the HAMMER again and again.     Empties the gun.
Milo jerks and twitches.     Racked by gunfire.
Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard, making
Gorgeous's bloody buns even bloodier --
Clutches himself.     Looks over at Hallenbeck.
<b>                       HALLENBECK
</b>         She's something, isn't she?
Milo pitches forward.     Falls to his death.

</b><b>                                                       160.
</b><b>HALLENBECK
</b>stares, dumbfounded at Sarah.   She look up at him.
A moment passes between them.
Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS
BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody.
Bullet-scarred.
Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe.
They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says:
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         The car's over on the other side.
         C'mere, I want to show you
         something.


<b>EXT. 405 FREEWAY - SOUTHBOUND LANE - NIGHT
</b>Jimmy and Joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the
rented Subaru. Jimmy points to the shattered window.
<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Somebody broke in and swiped the
         suitcase from the back seat. Had
         to be Marcon, right?
There is a pause. They both stare at the car.
Two million. Down the drain.
Except, after a beat... they begin to laugh.
First chuckling, then chortling..
Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls.
Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk --
You can guess what's inside.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>         Son of a bitch got the wrong one!

Signed by Joe Montana, no less.

<b>CONRAD MARCON

possessions into a travel bag. Hefts it. Puts it near
the door.

</b>Crosses to the bed, where the other suitcase lies.
Looks at it. Smiles, contented.
Can't help himself.    He reaches out.    Flicks the latch.
Opens it.
There is a note taped to the inside:
<b>                         FUCK YOU

<b>EXT. DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT

<b>EAST L.A. SIDESTREET - NIGHT
</b>Two ten-year-old black boys are walking down the street.
Out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of
the skyscrapers.
Quite suddenly, without warning --
A football drops out of the sky.
Hits and bounces, very high --
Comes down. Settles. Rocks, back and forth.
The kids look up, puzzled.      Searching the sky.

The ball sits there.    Only slightly scorched.
Tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught,
one of the boys bends down... looks both ways...
Picks up the ball.    Smiles.
Then, as if by some unspoken agreement --
The other boy starts to run.
Slowly at first, then faster... faster still...
A slant pattern, heading for the mailbox...
And at 12 midnight on December 22nd, the San Pedro Street
quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass.
Their laughter is joyful.    Innocent.    Fervid.
They will grow up to be sports heroes.

Bessalo glares at him.

Hallenbeck smiles.
<b>                       HALLENBECK

Bessalo looks at him like he's grown a tail.
