    of an empty stretch of land parted down the middle by
    railroad tracks. An Amtrak Commuter crests the horizon,
    heads TOWARD us. As it gets CLOSER, we GO IN TIGHTER to
    see --

    distant and lovely and sad. SUPERIMPOSED against an
    endless stream of sky and trees. The train speeds up and
    SARA's face flies by, disappearing FROM FRAME.

    A zaftig BLACK WOMAN clumsily negotiates the aisle.
    Stops at the first of a few empty seats left in the car.

<b>    ANGLE ON SARA
</b>
    looking up, around. She shakes her head, clears her
    backpack and magazines from the seat beside her. The
    Woman drops down, settles in. A long silence. The Woman
    glances at the American Ballet magazine on Sara's lap.
    Tries to make conversation.

<b>                             WOMAN
</b>               I love ballet. Never had the body
               for it. Do you dance?

    Sara folds her arms, turns away mumbling under breath.

</b>               Used to.

    Sara gazes out the window. The world outside begins to
    dissolve melting into images from another time, another
    place. Her eyes stare blankly OUT AT us, blinded by her
    memories.

<b>5   FLASHBACK - INT. AUDITORIUM - KINDERGARTEN RECITAL - DAY 5

    A stage full of five-year-olds in tights and tutus. A
    little girl performs center stage. She's remarkably
    poised, remarkably good. CAMERA PANS TO the audience. A
    woman in an Irish clover necklace springs to her feet
    clapping loudly. The little girl's eyes catch the glint
    of the necklace's gold. Mommy. She flashes a megawatt
    smile, ends the dance with an unscripted bow, as we...

    Young Sara, lithe and earnest, dances. A budding beauty
    blessed with long limbs and natural grace, she makes it
    look easy. Gliding past the envious stares of
    classmates, she scans the hall for a glint of gold.
    Finds it in the back of the room where her mother, Glynn,
    stands watching her. Their eyes connect with mutual
    smiles and those smiles CARRY us TO:

</b>
    A pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood
    floor. PAN UP and PULL BACK to reveal Sara at 17,
    dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and
    rolled up rugs. As Glynn looks on, Sara completes the
    routine with a pirouette. She spins out of it with a
    preoccupied frown on her face.

<b>                            GLYNN

             Everybody there's going to be
             good, Mom. I have to be better.
                    (then, beginning
                     again)
             My knees still knock when I do my
             free form. Did you notice that?

<b>                           GLYNN
</b>             I noticed that it was fine.

</b>                    (escalating
                     frustration)
             It's not supposed to be fine.

</b>             And it just lays there, it doesn't

                         battle)
                 I've got something for you. Come
                 on. Sit. Mouth closed, eyes
                 shut. No pouting. No peeking.

    Sara flops down on the sofa beside her. Closes her eyes.
    Glynn removes the clover chain from her neck, fastens it
    around Sara's.

<b>                               GLYNN
</b>                 For luck tomorrow. Not that
                 you'll need it. You dance like an
                 angel.

    The necklace is Glynn's talisman. Sara knows what it
    means to her. She throws her arms around Glynn, holds
    onto her tightly.

<b>                               SARA

                 still the best luck I'll ever
                 have.

    Glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up.        They cling to
    each other.

    In the blink of her eyes, the memory fades. She pulls
    the window shade, shifts in her seat. Her fingers travel
    to the clover necklace at her throat. Linger. The Woman
    regards her.

     A sea of young white faces. A jock entertains the troops
     with two straws up his nose. Sara sits next to her best
     friend, LINDSAY, 17. Lindsay, chomping on a wad of gum,
     turns from the jock to Sara with a bubble in bloom,
     bursts it with her teeth.

<b>                                LINDSAY
</b>                  Wanna pray? You're leaving for

                  Lindsay... no. Not here.

     Lindsay grabs Sara's hand and bows her head.      Sara,
     embarrassed, aligns her head with Lindsay's.      She's
     praying nobody sees them.

<b>                                LINDSAY

                  Please make them ready for her.
                  Even if she screws up. Thanks.
                  Amen.'
                         (sure shrug; another
                          bubble)
                  God's gotten me outta all kinds of

     Sara exits with a bouquet of roses, takes the steps two
     and three at a time. Glynn's waiting in a flower van at
     the curb.

     Sara and Glynn. The back of the van is filled with
     flower arrangements. Glynn takes note of the roses in
     Sara's hand.

               definitely movin' up in the world.

     Sara looks through the windshield.   It's starting to
     drizzle.

<b>                             SARA
</b>               Know what would be great? If you
               didn't drop me off at the bus
               station. If we just kept going
               until we get to Philly.

               back. That's your definition of
               great? I can see the headline
               now: 'Starving Artist Kills Unfit
               Mother.'

               Sweetheart, we talked about this.
               I'll get there as soon as I can.

     Sara looks at her and Glynn instantly feels guilty.

<b>                             SARA
</b>               Right. This is the hardest, most
               important day of my life and all

     A moment. They look at each other. Sara finally smiles.
     They embrace and she hops out the van. Glynn calls after
     her.

     Sara, in costume, flips through a magazine. She taps her
     toes, checks her watch. A phalanx of parents and dancers
     are clustered around a sign posted on the door:
     JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE AUDITIONS. Sara stares at it.
     Re-checks her watch. An official with a clipboard walks
     toward her. Where's her mother?

     Sara on stage. She looks past a row of Juilliard JUDGES
     into the audience. No glint of gold. MOZART'S "Elvira
     Madigan" (Andante) CUES UP. Sara begins her technical.
     She transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful
     performance. The Judges are mutely but clearly
     impressed. One of them looks directly at her.

                  you begin? A motif... a theme?

     Sara's stomach drops to her feet. Her mother's not there
     and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme.
     Shit!

<b>                                SARA
</b>                  Well, it's um, pretty self-
                  explanatory. The theme.

     The Judges exchange a look. New MUSIC CUES UP. Some
     driving, CLASSICAL NUMBER.   Sara tries to elevate her
     body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her
     feet. She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium
     for Glynn. Searching for her port in the storm.
     Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's
     dancing. Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling,
     recovering, and finally finishing with those damned
     knocking knees. The Judges, eyes like stones,
     perfunctorily nod. Their equivalent of maybe next year.
     Sara chokes two words out...

     Her legs buckle beneath her. The trooper and the

     ROY JOHNSON, 37, a handsome, laconic man of uncertain

     stomps it. Passengers disembark from the train. Roy
     searches their faces. They all look like strangers.

     A conductor helps Sara to the platform. Steam from the

     it. Sees him. They see each other. Roy weakly waves.
     Walks toward her. Sara watches his bow legs stiffly
     advance. She wants to run. Can't.

     Sara peers out    the windshield. Baltimore City. The
     neighborhoods    are changing. The streets are getting
     progressively    gritty and dirty. It surprises her. It
     worries her.     Roy worries her.

     Sara looks askance at him, her expression indicating
     otherwise. A moment. Roy's too new at this to hold up
     both ends of the conversation. The silence deepens. Roy
     switches on the radio.

     Roy's truck pulls up to a string of disrepaired rowhouses
     with pristine white marble steps. He and Sara each lug a
     suitcase from the truck. Her eyes wander up and down the
     street. They're on the fringes of a ghetto. A few
     people roost on their stoops, hang on the corners. All
     of them have black faces.

     The second floor of a two-story house has been turned
     into a one-bedroom studio. A partition separates the
     living area from the bedroom. Sara walks past a
     collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of
     herself. Aside from the saxophones and the pictures,
     there's hardly any furniture. Roy lights a cigarette.

               it out. On the other side.

     Suitcase in hand, Sara walks around the partition. Her
     "room" is an old futon, an ancient set of drawers. She
     stands in the middle of nothing, wanting something to do.
     She removes framed photos of Glynn from her backpack,
     places them around the room.

     She's a wall. A brick wall. Roy's head aches from

     Sara lying in bed... wide awake... her stiff upper lip

     the bathroom. Closes the door oh-so-quietly behind her.
     She flips on the light, crosses to the sink, turns on
     both faucets. As the water flows and the PIPES RATTLE,
     the brick wall shatters. Sara crumbles to the floor.
     Buries her head in her arms. Cries like a baby.

     flank a metal detector. When it's Sara's turn to pass

     That's it! The entire student body is energized. Sara's
     thoughts are jolted by two black girls squeezing by. One
     clips Sara's elbow as she passes, knocking it against a
     locker. They keep going as if they don't see her. No
     one seems to see her. Welcome to mass avoidance at
     Patterson High.

     Sara's back is to a black girl striding purposefully
     toward her. CHENILLE -- tall, pretty, with about a
     million braids in her hair -- swoops Sara's backpack from
     the floor. Thrusts it at her.

     She stalks off. Snookie oogles her departure, peers at
     Patrick, about to say something. Patrick cuts him off,
     indicates cards.

     A flash of commiseration, of guilt, crosses Patrick's

     Sara exits with Chenille. A CAR HORN starts to blare.
     Both of them ignore it. But it goes on like a musical
     number. Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a
     stone when she looks across the street. Roy's parked at
     the curb, waiting for her. She rolls her eyes and he
     HONKS AGAIN. Then he waves at her. Waves! Chenille
     looks at Sara. Then at Roy.

     She walks into the kitchen. Roy's in front of the open
     freezer door. Grinning from ear to ear. He motions her
     over. Sara crosses to the freezer. Looks inside.

     It's full of frozen dinners.       They're in unruly, lopsided

     An empty beer bottle, one askew kitchen chair. Vestiges

     the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche
     of falling food. A box of Sugar Puffs cereal lands at
     her feet. Something else out of place. She picks it up,
     jams everything back into the freezer. Slams the door
     shut.

     in a whirlwind, cleaning the apartment. Wall to wall.
     Scrubbing away what's churned up inside. The dervish
     ends in her "room," where she finishes unpacking.
     Several layers into a suitcase, she comes to her ballet
     shoes. The sight hits her like a slap in the face. Sara
     stares at the shoes until her eyes blur. Then she
     snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet.

     She puts the beaker down. Picks up a vial. Flips
     through her textbook. Her eyes shift from it to the
     blackboard, trying to make a connection. She settles on
     one. Picks up a vial of powder. Patrick grabs her hand,
     leans over and whispers.

</b>              I wouldn't do that if I were you.

</b>                     (yanks her hand back)
              Who died and made you teacher?

     Patrick pulls back, looks at her. He can't believe she
     dissed him. A small smile forms on his face. Sara turns
     away from it, goes back to her vials. Patrick slides to
     the farthest end of the table. Watches her consternation
     with bemusement.

<b>                            PATRICK
</b>              Know the difference between ethyl
              glycol and methyl acetate? Both
              got three elements, two parts the
              same. It's that first part, C2
              versus C3. C3 could blow a vial
              right out a person's hand.

     Sara thinks he's messing with her. But then the contents
     of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. Panicked, she
     drops the vial into their sink. It instantly goes up in
     smoke. Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat.
     Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. The
     class stops cold. Hill rushes up to them. Once he's
     sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick.

     Patrick stares at Sara.     Her face is red.     She's biting
     her lip.

     Hill's tone is searing. He turns to     Sara. She's trying
     to say something but the words won't    come out. Hill
     regards her wearily, then walks off    pushing the curious
     class back to their stations. Sara     looks at Patrick,
     weakly mouths "thanks."

     WIDEN to see the teacher and her class (FAVOR Sara,

     ("DIGGY") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher
     with her head demurely cast down. Clearing the teacher,
     Diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air.
     Gives up the double bird with much attitude. The class
     loves it. Cheers it. Until the teacher swerves around.

     Nikki on balance beam.    Agile.   Self-assured.   Good.

     ... And then TIGHTER STILL on Sara. Tentatively
     approaching the balance beam. Mindful of all the eyes on
     her, all the bated breaths. All waiting to see the new
     girl fall on her ass. Sara swings herself onto the beam
     with aplomb. Her legs and body are strong, supple,
     pliable rubber bands. She flounces across it on her
     tiptoes. Does a flawless split. Hops off. Looks out.

     her chest is exposed.

</b>
     Gaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse.
     Chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to
     get inside.

<b>                                 CHENILLE
</b>                  Rope dopes.   C'mon.

     She leads Sara to the door of FEETZ. The Sumo-sized MAN
     guarding it knows Chenille, digs her. His grin exposes
     gold-capped teeth.

<b>                               DOORMAN

               always.

<b>                             CHENILLE
</b>               Too fine to stand in line?

     The Man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- "in" being
     just inside the front door. A BOUNCER there collects the
     $10.00 cover charge. Checks their I.D. He hands Sara's
     back with a smirk.

<b>                             BOUNCER
</b>               Changed your hair.

     He waves a metal detector over their bodies, nods to yet
     another bouncer who escorts Sara and Chenille through yet
     another door.

     They march a short distance to an old elevator where a

     Everyone piles in.

     A smoky hole in the wall, filled to the brim with kids.
     Mostly black kids with a few whites and Latinos melting
     in. They share a common goal: To clog the dance floor,
     flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the
     masters: Tupac Shakur, NAS, Lauryn Hill, Puff Daddy,
     etc. Here, the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed,
     from erotic to vulgar; loving to lascivious.


<b>     ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
     Sara and Chenille. Sara's excited. She loves that she
     has to shout to be head over the music.

<b>                                CHENILLE
</b>                  Let's get our table 'fore it gets
                  crashed and I hafta hurt somebody.

     Sara's bewildered. She doesn't see any tables. She
     follows Chenille to the back of FEETZ. Sees six or seven
     tables. All of them have reserved signs. Most of them
     are filled.

<b>                                SARA
</b>                  What are you, some kind of V.I.P.?

     Chenille indicates the deejay booth.     Snookie's in it.

</b>               Snook hooks me up whenever he
               dees.

     They walk past a SLACKER in lycra pants and a big Army
     shirt. He licks his tongue at Chenille, grabs at her
     protruding butt. She swirls around, grabs his crotch
     hard enough to get his attention. The Slacker is
     squirming in her clutch.

<b>                             SLACKER

                  your paws on my ass? 'S'that how
                  I got it?

     Chenille bobs her head right in his face. Sara can't
     believe it. A few people have stopped and are looking.
     The Slacker nods hastily. Chenille releases him, gently
     smoothes out his shirt.

<b>                                 CHENILLE

     She and Sara continue on to back-of-the-club tables.
     Stop at a reserved one. An adjacent table sports Nikki,
     her three girl crew... and Diggy. All nurse drinks.
     Nikki snake-eyes Sara.

<b>                            NIKKI

     The three girls and Diggy snicker. Nikki gives Chenille
     a look. Turns back to Sara with a snide smirk. Points
     out her crew.

     Chenille cracks up mainly to back Sara up.       Nikki glowers
     at her.

                  not just call me a Negro.

     As Chenille bucks, Diggy springs up from her seat, runs
     her arm in the space between Chenille and Nikki like a
     referee.

     Whatever shit it is, Nikki's not taking any       chances. She
     ejects herself from the table, walks off.        The three
     girls scoot loyally after her. Diggy gets        up. Sits down
     at Sara's and Chenille's table. Diggy goes        with the
     flow. That's why she always fits in.

     Chenille pushes her way to the bar, tugging Sara along.
     A tall, angular twenty-something MAN on the far side of
     the bar sees her. She sees him. Sucks her teeth, nudges
     Sara.

<b>                                  CHENILLE
</b>              That's him.        Comin' over.   Kenny?
              Don't look.

     So of course Sara does. She makes a silly face at
     Chenille as Kenny sidles up to her. Chenille rolls her
     eyes half-heartedly.

<b>                                  KENNY (MAN)

     She shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell. She's
     in love with him. Enough to let him whisper in her ear,
     sweet-talk her away from the bar. Before she's swallowed
     up by the crowd, Chenille turns back to Sara, shouts:

     He walks off. CAMERA TRACKS him going deep inside the
     club. He wants a drink. He's almost at the bar when he
     sees Chenille on the dance floor with Kenny. She shrugs
     a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar. Toward
     Sara. The look is like, help me out. Don't let me leave
     her hangin'. Patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at
     Sara, before he really sees her. She looks fly. Hugely
     fly. He ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's
     ear.

     The closeness of his voice startles her. She turns into
     his smile. That cocksure, leave'em-weak-in-the-knees
     smile.

<b>                                SARA

     He coaxes her onto the dance floor. PARLIAMENT'S funk
     classic "Flashlight" is playing. The dance crowd is
     robustly singing the refrain to the song. There's a
     party on the floor. FAVOR Sara and Patrick, facing each
     other. He's moving already. She starts to dance,
     stiffly, tentatively. Patrick smiles at her. Shakes his
     head. He grabs her hands, swings them in time to the
     music.

<b>                             PATRICK

     The music's beginning to feel good to Sara. Patrick lets
     go of her hands. Starts to dance. Sara watches him
     intensely, her body follows his stiffly. Patrick's a
     good teacher. He leads without leaving her. Whenever
     she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into
     another less-complicated one.

     Sara begins to pick-up on Patrick's rhythm. Her eyes
     never wander from his. And then she starts to feel
     something else. They both do. A rising beat. A
     quickening heart. And not from the dancing. She smiles
     bashfully at him. Patrick suddenly grabs her around the
     waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance. All Sara
     can do is try to keep up and hang on.

     Malakai and the clinging girl nuzzle in a back corner.
     She licks his ear, whispers into it. Malakai laughs.
     Then his expression abruptly darkens. A storm cloud
     comes over it. He gets up.

     ... two dealers a few feet away. They're talking to an
     Asian guy with a multi-colored Mohawk. One slips Mohawk
     a packet of coke, the other takes his money. WIDER as
     Malakai reaches the dealers. He doesn't explain, doesn't
     complain. He just starts swinging.

     The MUSIC changes and their dance ends. They stand there
     for a moment, a little caught up in each other. A little
     unsure of the moment. And then there's a scream!
     Several of them actually. Patrick reacts to it
     instinctively. Looking around. In a small pocket of the
     club he sees Malakai.

     wrangling their way to the front line of the crowd, Diggy
     not far behind them. Sara looks on, dumbfounded and
     dazzled by what she sees, which is --

</b>
     pummeling his dealer into cowering submission. Only then
     does he look over at Malakai who, eyes engorged with
     rage, is standing over his opponent, kicking and stomping
     him with no signs of letting up. Patrick can see
     Malakai's too far gone for talk. He rushes him from
     behind, nearly lifts Malakai off his feet to swing him
     away from the dealer's writhing body on the floor.

     with a false bravado.

      Sara shakes her head adamantly. He nods his head
      emphatically. Another stalemate. They dance coyly,
      seductively around it.

      flicker of fluorescent lights. Sara walks in. The

      Sara ventures carefully forward to the edge of the

      without being sen.

      A GIRL is seated on the toilet. A man straddles her, his
      crotch in her face. The Girl sees Sara. Something in
      her face gives this away. The "man" glances out past his
      shoulder. He looks right down our throat straight into
      Sara's eyes. Malakai.

      staring at him.

      She sees Mr. Hill, starts to move for him. Someone grabs
      her arm from behind. She turns, startled, a little
      afraid. It's the Girl from the stall. She looks Sara in

      She looks at him. Patrick grins. Sara knocks her legs
      against his. He knocks his legs back. A silly moment.
      But it transcends the tension and creates a sweet truce
      between them.

      Momma Dean's fixing dinner. Patrick enters with the mail
      in his teeth, a load of books in his arms. He dumps the
      books on the counter, busses Momma Dean's check on the
      way to the 'fridge.

                   refrigerator.

      Patrick  backs up to the sink. Washes his hands.
      Impishly  dries them on her apron. He sits, begins
      sifting  through the mail. Momma Dean pulls an envelope
      from her  pocket. Waves it at him.

      Chenille appears in the doorway. Patrick takes the
      letter. He's almost afraid to open it. But he does.
      And as he reads the letter, a slyly relieved smile
      spreads across his face. He tosses the letter in the
      air. Grabs Chenille and Momma Dean. And the three of
      them jump up and down together with joy.

      She looks at him. Can't find any words. So she just
      goes into her evening bag and pulls out a small box. She
      hands it to him, a little nervous about how it will be
      received.

      Patrick opens the box. Removes a key chain. It's
      engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc.).
      He regards her, touched.

</b>                Wait.     There's more.

      She leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand. The
      back side of it is engraved with the words, "PATRICK
      REYNOLDS, M.D." Patrick locks eyes with Sara, lifts her
      hand to his lips. Kisses it softly. The gesture is
      succinct but alluring and, for a brief moment, they're
      the only two people in the world.

      The bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on.
      Sits across from Sara and Patrick who have moved even
      closer to each other. Patrick's arm is around Sara's
      shoulder. He whispers something in Sara's ear. She
      laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at
      them with a muted but obvious repugnance. Watching the
      woman from the corner of her eye, Sara drapes her arms
      around Patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. Patrick's
      eyes widen. Sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds
      one of her legs between his and whispers:

      He grabs her ass   -- what else is there? -- runs his hand
      along her side.    The white woman, thoroughly disgusted,
      gets up and moves   to the back of the bus. Patrick and
      Sara look at each   other, burst out laughing.

      The equivalent of D.C.'s Kennedy Center, the hall is
      awash in lights and activity. Men and women are donned
      in formal attire. Parking valets hover on the sidewalks
      waiting for cars. Into this, Sara and Patrick walk. She
      looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner --
      "Boston Ballet, A Command Performance." Sara's heart
      stops. Her feet freeze. Patrick looks at her. She
      looks positively catatonic.

      Sara looks at him, feeling bad. Feeling stupid for
      ruining the evening. She bites her lip, shakes her head
      ("but nothing"). Patrick takes her and they go in.


<b>120   INT. BALTIMORE HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                     120

      Sara and Patrick watch the Boston Company perform Igor
      Stravinsky's "Scenes De Ballet" as choreographed by
      Christopher Wheeldon. They're both enraptured. But
      while Patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of Sara,
      her eyes remain fixed on the dancers, the dance. She is
      utterly, totally engaged and amazed. The yearning that
      never really left her returns to tug at her heart and
      project her soul onto the stage.

      Post-ballet, Sara and Patrick walk. She's quiet,
      introspective. Patrick's at a loss. He can't decipher
      her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it.

<b>                              PATRICK

      She looks over at him, tries to smile.

<b>                              SARA
</b>                I'm sorry.

      They come to a small, secluded bridge.     Sara sits down on
      the edge of it. Patrick follows suit.      A long moment.

<b>                              SARA

                I did. But ballet isn't a part of
                my life anymore.

                about not dancing, at least tell
                me somethin' real.

      A long, difficult moment wherein Sara attempts to find
      the words, face the pain that comes with them. Finally,
      she looks at him.

      She stares out at the water, the moon reflected off of
      it. It's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil
      she's feeling. But she goes on.

                sense. When my life made sense.
                       (because)
                And it's all my fault. She got
                scraped off the highway for me,
                for my fucking audition. She was
                rushing. It was raining. It was

                       (a torrent)
                ... But she promised to be there.
                I made her promise. And then I
                didn't wait for her. I should
                have but they called my name and I
                didn't say anything. I just went
                out and danced. I was mad. I
                needed her and she wasn't there.

      She buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked
      with tears and guilt. Patrick puts his arms around her.

      regards her tenderly, moves her hair from her eyes.
      Stares deeply into them. Sara smiles wanly, certain she
      looks like shit. But it doesn't matter. The moment has
      named itself. And so, with more certainty than passion,
      they kiss.

      than we've seen before. HOLD ON closet door. A beat
      before Sara emerges from behind it, ballet slippers in
      hand. She takes a deep breath. Slides them on. Peers
      down at her feet. Wiggles them. Nothing magical or
      mystical but simply wonderful. Gleefully wonderful.
      Like the end of a long day's journey to home.

               It hurts! I'm out of shape and it

</b>                This is the perfect spot for that.
                You can run around and I can sit
                under the trees and watch you.

<b>                              SARA
</b>                I don't get in shape like that.
                But it's still a good spot.
                       (diffidently)
                I got my application for
                Juilliard. Just in time too.
                They're holding auditions in

      She looks at him, shakes her head.   Not that great.

                takes a lot of time, a lot of
                preparation. I used to practice
                two, three hours every day. I'm
                so far behind...

      ... And unsure and afraid. Which Patrick can sense.        But

      Sara in the mirror dressed in leotards and tights.       She
      bends forward from the hip, extends a leg, a
      corresponding arm.

      As she tries to complete the arabesque, the backward-most
      leg buckles. She steadies herself. Starts over.

</b>
      OPEN CLOSE ON a black hand shaking a white one. PULL
      BACK to reveal Patrick and Roy. Sara enters looking
      striking, pretty, very down. Chenille's influence is
      written all over her makeup and her clothes. Overlooking
      Roy, she blithely tags Patrick.

      They leave. Roy stands in the middle of the room,
      dumbfounded.

</b>
      Usual suspects, usual music. Patrick hands Sara a call-
      brand beer. Leans in with his drink, openly and
      contently with her.


<b>      ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
      Nikki and her crew (Jasmin, Tiff'nee, Alyssa). Nikki
      hasn't seen Patrick and Sara. She's showing her crew a
      dance.


<b>      ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
      Chenille, Diggy and another black girl.     Fraternizing.


<b>      ANOTHER ANGLE - DEEJAY BOOTH
</b>
      A chrome-domed deejay with a Barry White baritone bellows
      into his mike as he changes the music.

      WIDER as the dance floor swells with kids. PICK UP Sara
      and Patrick among them. She looks at him nervously. He
      smiles.

<b>                              PATRICK
</b>                Nobody's watchin' you but me.

      A gallant lie. Sara tries    to believe it. They dance.
      Practice has made her near   perfect. Their movements are
      ambitious, nimble, better   than anyone else on the floor.
      They move so well together   that Snookie, dancing nearby,
      starts chanting:

</b>
      Diggy.     Jiggling and wildly gyrating.   Chiming in --

</b>                   Go, Sara!   Go, Sara!


<b>      PATRICK AND SARA
</b>
      building up a sweat; confidently dancing at fever pitch.

      Sara and Patrick, still going at it. Snookie, Diggy and
      others prance around them like backup dancers.


<b>      ANOTHER ANGLE - NIKKI
</b>
      standing with her crew dourly observing Patrick and Sara.

<b>                                NIKKI
</b>                  Watch me squash their shit.    Hard.


<b>      ON NIKKI
</b>
      Shoving, pushing, and barging her way up to Patrick.
      Without preamble or regard for Sara, she starts dancing
      with him. Patrick looks at Sara but he's somehow dancing
      with Nikki. Sara retreats with daggers in her eyes.
      Pissed.


<b>      PATRICK (AND NIKKI)
</b>
      unresponsive as she grinds her body into his, raw and
      wild.


<b>      SARA
</b>
      standing where she can see but can't be seen from the
      dance floor. From a curtain of kids, Malakai suddenly
      appears at her side. Sara can't move. She's boxed in.
      Malakai indicates Nikki and Patrick with slick
      satisfaction, whispers derisively:

                   You're milk. Ain't no point in
                   tryin' to mix.

      He evaporates into the crowd.        Sara stands there.


<b>      PATRICK AND NIKKI
</b>
      as a SLOW DANCE BEGINS. Nikki starts to press herself
      against Patrick. Patrick holds her off with both arms.
      Walks away.


<b>      WIDER ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR - FAVOR PATRICK
</b>
      moving toward Sara.

      A stark, apologetic expression on his face. He takes her
      hand. Sara fiercely jerks away. Patrick grabs her hand
      again, more emphatically this time. But Sara won't budge
      from the spot where she's standing. So Patrick slides
      his arms around her, holds her without moving. They
      remain like this for a moment or two until they slowly
      begin to dance. We PUSH IN ON them in this little space.
      Patrick's lips brush Sara's ear.

<b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                   Sara...?

<b>      ANGLE PAST THEM ON MALAKAI
</b>
      slow dancing with his flavor of the night. Eyes on Sara
      and Patrick. Both underwhelmed and resentful of what he
      sees.


<b>135   INT. ROY'S ROWHOUSE - HALLWAY/FRONT DOOR - THAT NIGHT           135
</b>
      Sara unlocks the door. She and Patrick enter. She turns
      on the lights. Looks at him. Answers the unspoken
      question.

                   be gone all night.

      Patrick sits down on the sofa. Sara crosses to the
      STEREO, turns it ON. A SAX SOLO begins playing.

<b>                                SARA
</b>                   Roy's demo. The only one he ever
                   cut. Kinda grows on you.

      A beat.   Somewhere between five seconds and forever.
      Then:

<b>                                 SARA
</b>                   Wanna see my room?

      Patrick looks at her, nods. He gets up, follows Sara
      behind the partition into her "room." They stand there
      for a moment. He cups her face with his hands. Kisses
      her. They begin to take off each other's clothes,
      alternately sure and fumbling; a bit awkward, a bit
      urgent. Sara unzips Patrick's pants, catches something
      other than his clothes. Patrick winces in pain. She
      looks at him with an embarrassed grimace. Says this very
      low.

<b>                                 SARA
</b>                   Sorry...

      They kiss again, stumble backward to her futon.       Fall
      down upon it and begin to make love.

      CAMERA TRACKS them as they walk down the hall hand-in-
      hand, sometimes exchanging greetings with other students.
      They are officially a couple and they appear to be in
      love. At the door to Sara's next class, Patrick busses
      her lips before she enters.

      Malakai, along with Snookie and two brain donors, ARVEL
      and LIP, eat at a booth. Patrick strolls in gritty from
      work. Tired from work. He slides in next to Malakai.
      The mood is light, jovial.

      Sara and Patrick, post-coital. She's in her robe. He's
      dressed but they're fooling around as they fix
      sandwiches. Patrick drops down in a chair. Sara drops
      down on his lap.

      She throws her arms around his neck, kissing him.
      Patrick slides his hands under her robe, cups her
      breasts. Sara responds to him. They are too engrossed
      in this intimacy to hear the FRONT DOOR OPENING, to see
      Roy until he walks in and sees them. Sara leaps up,
      closes her robe. Patrick doesn't know what to do. He's
      caught. Straight up. Red-handed. Roy's eyes dart
      between them, settle on and slice into Patrick.

      Patrick stands up.      Sara grabs his arm defiantly, holds
      him back.

      Patrick jerks his arm free from Sara, grabs his jacket
      off the back of his chair. He back-talks Roy as he
      passes him.

      It takes everything Patrick has to keep walking until

      Patrick glares in the Old Woman's direction, then back at
      Nikki.

</b>                   I thought I was goin' someplace

                   me off. But you ain't tryin' to
                   remember that. Now you mad. Why?
                   Because she's white and I like
                   her? I'm with her.

<b>                                NIKKI

                   she's white. That's what sets me
                   off.

                   nothin' to do with you and what
                   you think. So keep your hands off
                   her and that shit to yourself.

      Nikki folds her arms across her chest, looks at him
      defiantly.

      She turns on her heels, goes back to her machine.
      Patrick rises, sees the old woman glinting at him. He
      holds her hateful stare for a moment, then walks out.

      Chenille and Kenny.     In the middle of a contentious
      moment. He tries to     give her some money. She snatches
      it out of his hand.     Kenny looks at her. He's hurt.
      Chenille's too mad to    see it.

      The room is filled with young women, most them black, and
      children of all ages. They are piled up like cars on a
      freeway, waiting to be seen. The noise level is at a
      peak when Chenille and Sara walk in. Chenille's carrying
      a fussy Christopher, his diaper bag and her backpack.
      Sara, wanting to be helpful, reaches for Christopher.

<b>                                 SARA
</b>                   Want me to take him?

      Chenille shakes her head. Walks to reception to sign
      herself in. Sara takes in the faces of girls younger
      than herself, the grime and gloom of the room. It's
      incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children
      are brought to get well. Chenille finishes at the desk.
      Returns to Sara. They cross to a corner of the clinic
      where they sit -- on the floor. Chenille indicates the
      receptionist bitterly.

<b>                                 CHENILLE

                   name on the damn list. Triflin'
                   bitch.

      Chenille starts to change Christopher's diaper. He
      starts to wail and flail. Chenille can't placate him.
      One of his kicks connects with Chenille's open backpack,
      sends books and papers flying. Sara can see the veins
      stand up on Chenille's neck.

<b>                                   SARA
</b>                   I'll get 'em.

      She does. Chenille's finally got control of Christopher
      but he's still crying. Chenille slips off his dirty
      diaper. When Sara hands her a clean one, Chenille
      regards her strangely, as if just remembering that she's
      there.

<b>                                 CHENILLE

      Chenille flashes a look, finishes up with Christopher.
      She picks him up, puts a bottle in his mouth. Cradles
      him.

               Get out my face, and take that ho
               with you.

      Patrick bucks up. Sara walks over to him, gently
      clutches his sleeve. It's no easier to turn away from
      Malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of
      friendship. But Patrick does. With Sara holding onto
      his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away.

      walking. A heavy silence. Sara looks over at him.
      Patrick doesn't say anything. But after a moment, he
      reaches down and takes her hand and they walk on like
      this together.

      OVER MUSIC (e.g. BUSTA RHYMES' "Dangerous.")

      awhile. Sara makes a misstep. Patrick stops. Cold.
      Sara grits on him.

      up.

      Sara exits, looking pretty much like she feels. Like

      connect for a brief, awful moment before they continue on

      looks at him, tries to smile past the dour expression on

      He hands her an audio cassette of her free form music.
      Sara gazes at it, then up at him, understanding what this
      means. She won't let him see how it shatters her. He
      hesitates, as if he wants to say something else. But
      Sara turns her back on him and Patrick walks away.


<b>      ANOTHER ANGLE - TONI
</b>
      approaching Sara's locker. Having seen the encounter
      between Patrick and Sara, she's as smug and overbearing
      as ever.

</b>                   Lovers' quarrel? You're better

                   spent all your money in a news
                   flash. Trust me on that, Sara.

      Sara stares at her, uncomprehending at first. She
      resists the urge to slap the smile off Toni's face.   She
      gets in it instead.

<b>                                 SARA

      separate from them. The walls have been    transformed into

      Pictures of her and Glynn. Roy knocks on the partition.

      keeps flipping.

      herself.

      Patrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to Arvel's
      parents, who are clearly stricken. Arvel's father,
      stoic, holds his wife's hand. Arvel's mother kneads a
      Kleenex, her face etched with tears. Patrick hugs her.
      Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off
      by the palpable grief. Patrick crosses over to him.
      They retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for
      Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation.

<b>                                 MALAKAI
</b>                   Why his mom's cryin' like that?
                   Arvel's gonna make it, right?
                   That what's his nurse said. She
                   told me herself, 'Your friend's
                   gonna make it.' Did that bitch
                   lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick!
                   Is he gone?

      Patrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room, backs
      him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds
      him there.

<b>                                 PATRICK

                          (trying to be
                           strong; faltering)
                   Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull
                   through. Thing is, when he does,
                   they don't think... he ain't...
                   shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk
                   again.

      In that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul
      crumbles. He looks at Patrick with aggrieved disbelief
      and then a building anger. A stronger man would probably
      cry.

      Patrick eases his grip. Malakai straightens his body,
      cocks his head slightly. Studies Patrick in this
      crooked, derisive way.

</b>                Does it have a theme?

<b>                              SARA
</b>                Yes.  Emo...
                       (clears her throat)
                Emotion.

      The Judge turns around, shouts to someone we can't see:

<b>                                 STERN JUDGE
</b>                   Cue Johnson's music.

      MUSIC UP: A remix of hip-hop (e.g., LAURYN'S HILL'S doo
      wop; NAS'S "We Will Survive" and JAY Z's latest) and
      snatches of CLASSICAL.


<b>      SARA
</b>
      stands there. Doesn't move. Can't. She finally walks
      up to the edge of the stage. Looks down at the judges,
      her eyes filled with trepidation. Her voice is a shaky
      whisper.

                   you start it over again?


<b>      REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
      The Judge waving off the MUSIC.      It STOPS.      He regards
      Sara impatiently.

<b>                                 STERN JUDGE
</b>                   Are you ready now?

      Before she can respond, Patrick's voice booms from the
      back of the auditorium.

<b>                                   PATRICK (O.S.)
</b>                   Yes, sir.    She's ready.

      ANGLE WIDENS to reveal him coming forward. Rushing for
      the stage. He pauses at the apron of it. Looks up at
      Sara. She peers down at him, astounded. Shaken. He
      smiles at her. She smiles back. Patrick's eyes softly
      take her in.

<b>                                  PATRICK
</b>                   You can do it.
                          (because)
                   Ain't nobody watchin' you but me.

      Sara's eyes focus on him.       She nods.     Turns to the
      judges.

<b>                                   SARA
</b>                   I'm ready.

      As her MUSIC cues up, Patrick slowly backs away from the
      stage.

      Sara begins to dance.

      She starts out strong and gets stronger. Every emotion
      she feels, every experience she's had, comes to life in a
      way that we've never seen before, not even when she was
      practicing with Patrick. Her body has finally found a
      way to get inside this kind of music, to elevate its
      meaning and transform her dance.

      The MUSIC ENDS.     The lights go up.

      Sara stands in the middle of the stage breathless,
      sweating. She lifts her head slowly and the ANGLE WIDENS
      to reveal --

      Patrick letting out a giant whoop...

      The judges react and the audience gasps...

      ... as he bounds onto the stage and...

      Roy jumps to his feet.      Proudly and loudly clapping.
      Just like Glynn.

<b>      ANGLE - SARA
</b>
      overwhelmed beyond belief. Patrick's coming toward her.
      She flies into his arms, free and happy, overjoyed. But
      the triumph of her performance and the sheer bliss of the
      moment are transcended by something deeper and clearer,
      which is her love for Patrick.


<b>      JUDGES
</b>
      struggling to maintain their and the proceeding's
      decorum, since the audience, caught up in the throes of
      this excitement, has begun to loudly, enthusiastically
      react.

<b>                                 STERN JUDGE

                   Young man! Get off the stage.

      WIDER to reveal the room.

      Patrick hugging Sara, looks down at the judges.

<b>                              PATRICK
</b>                All due respect, if ya'll don't
                let this girl in, you're crazy!

      Sara pulls Patrick back. Walks alone to the edge of the
      stage, composed and professional again. She regards the
      judges with a beaming resolve and a ballerina's curtsy,
      then simply says:

<b>                                  SARA
</b>                   Thank you.   Very much.

<b>                                  STERN JUDGE
</b>                   Ms. Johnson!

      Sara stops.    Turns back to him.      The Judge smiles.

<b>                                 STERN JUDGE

<b>      SARA'S FACE
</b>
      lovely and radiant as it breaks into a cheek-to-cheek
      smile. WIDER as she walks slowly, deliberately back to
      Patrick. Stops. Looks at him. Just looks. And then
      she throws her arms around his neck, kissing and hugging
      him. Emotional. Patrick swings her into the air, twirls
      her around and around, as we:

      OVER SLOW MUSIC (possible theme song):

      Sara (in a gown) and Patrick (in a tux). Dancing (as if
      they had danced from the last FRAME INTO this one). They
      are beautiful.

      WIDER to reveal the entire dance floor...

      And we see that it's the senior prom.

      The room's dressed up like a dreamy, futuristic romantic
      illusion. The ceiling's ablaze with tiny, star-like
      lights; under them large poufs of cotton clouds hang.
      Glittering, mirrored balls dangle over the main floor.

      Seniors dance in traditional and cutting edge tuxes and
      mouth-watering, eye-popping versions of dresses and
      gowns. CAMERA PANS the floor, PICKING UP:

      A surprisingly dashing Snookie and the fly girl. As they
      dance, he bravely but rather too abruptly dips her...

      Diggy (in a glitter tuxedo and spiked hair) and her
      date...

      Nikki with whom we shall perceive to be the Howard
      University guy. In any event, he looks slightly bored.

      Chenille with Kenny, smiles at Sara as she and Patrick
      dance by.

      CAMERA FAVORS and PUSHES IN ON...

      Sara and Patrick. Gazing at each other.     The SONG ENDS
      with them in each other's arms.
