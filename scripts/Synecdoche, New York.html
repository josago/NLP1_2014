</b>
          Darkness. The sound of a radio and pots and pans clanging
          fades in. Caden, 40, opens his eyes in bed, and groggily
          looks at himself in the bureau mirror. The bedside clock
          reads 7:45.

</b>
          Adele, 40, in t-shirt and sweats, mixes a bowl of instant
          oatmeal, puts it in the microwave.

          Adele leaves the kitchen. Caden, also 40, enters as she's
          leaving. He's dressed in a ratty terrycloth robe.

          Olive, 4, sits on the toilet. Adele enters, rips some toilet
          paper off the roll and proceeds to wipe Olive. The phone
          rings in the kitchen.

<b>          ADELECADEN (O.S.)
</b>          Caden, could you get that? It's Maria. I don't want to.

          (looks at bright green

</b>          Hey.

</b>          Oh, wiping Olive's ass. You?
          Caden is pouring himself a cup of coffee. He sips it and
          stares out the window. It's raining.

<b>          ADELE (CONT'D)
</b>          You're kidding! Holy fuck!
          Caden exits with his coffee, annoyed about the phone call.

          Caden passes the bathroom. Olive is staring into the toilet
          bowl. Adele can be heard chatting in the background.

<b>          OLIVE
</b>          Daddy, my poop is green.
          Caden enters the bathroom, looks into the bowl at the green
          feces and smeared toilet paper. He seems freaked out.

</b>
          Caden steps out the front door in his bare feet and hurries
          down the driveway in the rain. He picks up the newspaper,
          pulls the mail from the box. As he heads back inside, he
          flips through the mail. There's a magazine called Attending
          to your Illness addressed to Caden. A diseased person on the
          cover. Across the street a gaunt man watches Caden, unseen.

          Caden sits at the kitchen table with his coffee, reading the

          oatmeal. This isn't a

          The sheep nods. Caden pours himself some more coffee, opens
          the milk carton to pour some in, then sniffs at the spout.
          He checks the date on the carton. It's October 20.

          sandwich in front of Olive.

          Caden is in the dentist's chair, a bloody bib around his
          neck. The dentist, in surgical mask, probes his open mouth,
          calls out numbers to an assistant, who records them.

          Caden shaves. A faucet explodes and smacks him in the
          forehead. He is sent staggering backwards with a yelp, into
          the far wall, his razor flying and blood pouring from a
          jagged cut above his right eyebrow. Off-screen, we hear the
          pounding footsteps of someone running toward us. Half of
          Caden's face is covered with shaving cream. Rivulets of
          blood intermingle with it. Water shoots out where the tap
          was, spraying the mirror, which is spattered with blood.
          Adele, dressed in heavily paint-splattered clothes, hurries
          in and takes in the scene: the wet, the mess, the blood.

          Caden sits on the toilet, presses a towel to his head. Adele
          squats, goes into a spasmodic coughing fit, finishes, opens
          the cabinet under the sink, pushes her arm through bottles of
          cleaning products, old sponges, old toothbrushes, toilet
          paper rolls and other junk to the shut-off valves.

<b>          ADELE (CONT'D)

<b>          CADEN
</b>          Will there be a scar?

</b>          What?
          The doctor feels Caden's pulse, then listens to his heart.
          He presses hard against the glands in Caden's neck.

          had an accident. No, I'm okay.

          tubes and they're behind walls and
          under the floor everywhere and --
          Olive begins to whimper in horror.

          Caden sits in the almost empty theater. A few people with

          that period: a kitchen, bedrooms, etc.

          Claire, the actress playing Linda Loman, sits in the set's
          bedroom. Davis, the actor playing Biff, lies on the top bunk
          of a bunk bed upstage. A fourth actor, playing Happy, lies on
          the bottom bunk.

          screeching sound effects.

          The wall continues to be pulled past the car crashing into

          Caden meets Tom at the foot of the stage. Behind them a
          group of technicians are lifting the wall and trying to re-
          set it. Claire primps in the bureau mirror.

<b>          21 INT. ADELE'S STUDIO - 2006 - DAY21
</b>
          The studio is a mess, the floor covered with paint. Adele,
          in her paint-spattered clothing, works on a tiny canvas, an
          inch square. She paints with a single-hair brush while
          looking through a magnifying glass. Caden pokes his head in.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          Can I piss in your sink?

<b>          ADELE
</b>          Um, yeah, I guess.
          Caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio. His
          urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder,
          through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an
          amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in
          a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while
          standing in a field of flames.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          It's gorgeous, Ad.

<b>          ADELE
</b>          Thanks. How was rehearsal?

<b>          CADEN
</b>          Awful. We have five hundred and
          sixty lighting cues. I don't know
          why I made it so complicated.

<b>          ADELE
</b>          It's what you do.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          Yeah. Anyway, we got through it.
          I think you'll be impressed.

<b>          ADELE
</b>          Caden, listen, I'm really sorry. I
          just can't go tonight.
          (off his look)
          I'm sorry. I've got to get two
          canvases ready to ship. By
          tomorrow. I know it sucks.

<b>          CADENADELE
</b>          But it's opening night.I know. I'm sorry. I would
           go if I could.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          I have to get ready.

<b>          22INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER - 2006 - NIGHT 22
</b>
          The theater is full. Caden stands nervously in the back.
          The lights dim. Hazel looks back from her seat at Caden and
          mouths the word "yay." He smiles. The curtain rises on a
          dark stage. Tom, as Willy, gets out of the car parked center
          stage and walks into the kitchen.

<b>          TOM (AS WILLY)
</b>          Oh boy, oh boy.

<b>          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
</b>          Willy!

<b>          TOM (AS WILLY)
</b>          It's all right, I came back.

<b>          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
</b>          Why? What happened?

<b>          (PAUSE)
</b>          Did something happen, Willy?

<b>          TOM (AS WILLY)
</b>          No, nothing happened.

<b>          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
</b>          You didn't smash the car, did you?

<b>          TOM (AS WILLY)
</b>          I said nothing happened. Didn't you
          hear me?

<b>          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
</b>          Don't you feel well?

<b>          TOM (AS WILLY)
</b>          I'm tired to death. I couldn't make
          it. I just couldn't make it, Linda.

<b>          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
</b>          Where were you all day? You look
          terrible.

<b>          TOM (AS WILLY)
</b>          I got as far as a little above
          Yonkers. I stopped for a cup of
          coffee... maybe it was the coffee.

          The car kept going off onto the
          shoulder, y'know?
          The audience is rapt. Caden relaxes.

          The cast party is in full swing. The opening was a success.
          Lots of drinking. Caden chats with Claire. Hazel watches
          from across the room.

<b>          CLAIRE
</b>          (scrunching her nose)
          Ugh, I hated myself tonight. Plus

          Sorry. I have a bit of a headache.

<b>          CLAIRE
</b>          (kisses his forehead)
          I just want to thank you for
          everything. You've been absolutely
          brilliant and it's going to be
          miserable going ahead without you.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          I'll be around. I'll check in.
          She gets teary, gives him a kiss on the cheek.

<b>          CLAIRE
</b>          God, I'm such a baby.
          She just looks at him and smiles and nods.

<b>          CLAIRE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm going to get drunk, that's
          what.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          Ok, Claire.
          She backs away and gets lost in the crowd. Caden massages
          his temples. Suddenly Hazel is next to him.

<b>          HAZEL
</b>          I figured I'd better get in fast.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          Hey!

</b>          I loved it! And, by the way,
          Claire is trouble. And not

          Caden laughs.

          fifteen minutes after. I loved
          every minute of it. Except Claire.
          I thought she was weak.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          Easy on the eyes.

<b>          HAZEL
</b>          Oh, Caden, not you, too. What I
          want to know is why she started
          crying in her last monologue, right
          after she had the line, 'I can't

          Hazel drives down a dark street, crying. People watch her
          passing car from various windows. There's a run-over dog,
          lit by a streetlight, glistening on the side of the road.

</b>          Hazel studies the dog. It's a bloody, gutty mess, squashed
          flat. Against all odds, it's still alive. Its head is
          lolling. She bends down to pet it.

          Hazel takes off her make-up, hair back in a clip. She
          watches herself blankly in the mirror, somewhat erased
          without eye make-up. The run-over dog is sleeping in a box
          on the floor.

          The party has thinned out. The remaining people are sitting
          around a table, drinking. Claire, next to Caden, rests her
          head, sleepily drunk, against his shoulder. Caden studies a
          series of lumps under the skin of his arm.

<b>          CLAIRE

          Hazel gets out of her car and walks up to a neat little house
          on a street of neat little houses. Faint swirls of smoke
          escape from the windows. She rings the doorbell. The button
          is hot; Hazel pulls her finger away.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          The idea is to do a massive theater
          piece. Uncompromising, honest. I
          don't know what it is yet or how to
          do it, but it'll come. It'll

          Pause.

<b>          CADEN
</b>          HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I think theater is:
          itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the beginning of thought. The
          truth not yet spoken. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a
          blackbird in winter. The moment
          before death. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what a man
          feels after heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been clocked in
          the jaw. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love... in all its
          messiness. And I want all of us,
          players and audience alike, to soak
          in the communal bath of it, the
          mikvah, as the Jews call it. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re
          all in the same water, after all,
          soaking in our very menstrual blood
          and nocturnal emissions. This is
          what I want to try to give people,
          Hazel. And I want your help.
          Hazel just stares. The food arrives. Caden looks at his
          plate and concentrates.

          Madeline spreads her legs a bit and smiles at Caden. He
          nervously grins, goes back to his book. He reads:

<b>          VOICE
</b>          I offer my flower to you and you
          deny it. This book is over.
          He turns the page. Blank. The rest of the book is blank.
          He looks over at Madeline. She is watching a movie.

          Caden stares at her for a moment, then lunges. He punches
          her repeatedly as she tries to get away. She throws a punch
          which connects with the side of his head and knocks him down.
          She hurries off.

          She turns down an alley. Caden, a half-block behind, hurries
          to the alley. She's gone. He walks through, looking for
          her. It's dark. Trash cans and garbage. He spots an
          unopened box next to the trash. It's pink with a picture of
          a nose on it. Caden drops to his knees and weeps. No tears
          come out. His eyes are dry and red. He pulls a vial of
          artificial tears from his pockets and moistens his eyes.
          Suddenly his breathing becomes wildly erratic.

          lies on a metal table in a cold room, while an old man in
          white military jacket examines him, pressing on his body in
          various places. The man is silent except for slow, long
          inhalations and exhalations through his nose. When he is
          through he leaves the room without saying a word. Caden lies
          there, not sure what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to do. After a while, he
          gets up and opens the door, looks both ways down the empty

          It's been scrubbed. There are small squared-off "apartment" 
          areas, with actors in each, going about their days. A couple  
          sleeps in a bed in one, in another there is a conversation  
          between people over dinner, a man watches television alone in 
          one, etc. There are at least fifteen configurations of  
          people with a reel-to-reel tape recorders in each set-up. 
          Caden walks from one to the other, eavesdropping, followed by 
          an assistant, Michael.

          told me two days before how much he 
          loves me. Everything's spinning out

          He stops at Claire's "apartment." She is ironing and  
          watching a daytime soap, which is a closed-circuit TV. The  
          actors in the soap are across the warehouse in another

          A rehearsal in progress. The shells of apartment buildings
          have been built. The actors, who previously had been spread
          out on the floor of the warehouse, are now perched on
          scaffolding in various apartment spaces. Caden, followed by
          Michael, surveys the scene by climbing up and down ladders.
          It's difficult to manage with his cane.

          Caden reads Olive's diary.

<b>          OLIVE'S GERMAN VOICE
</b>          Today I felt a wetness between my

          Overcast. Caden wanders. Walls are plastered with posters
          of "Flower Girl." It's Olive, early 20's, very sexy and
          naked. There is an address and a date. Seems to be some
          sort of concert.

<b>          106 INT. LOBBY - 2022 - NIGHT 106

          Caden waits on a long line behind a bunch of men.

</b>          Caden sits by himself in a cramped space. A light switches
          on behind scarred Plexiglas. Olive dances naked. Caden
          tries to get her attention by banging on the glass but she
          can't see him. A bouncer enters and beats Caden up.

          Caden, bruised, lies in bed while Claire hurries past,

          The neighborhood seems abandoned and overgrown. Caden is
          parked down the block and watches Hazel's house. Soon Hazel
          and Derek walk by. Derek says something and Hazel laughs
          delightedly. Caden is in agony. He rolls down his window.

          Hazel kisses Derek, whispers something in his ear. They
          share a giggle. Derek waves at Caden and heads into the
          burning house. Hazel approaches Caden's car.

          Dark, deserted part of town. The wind blows wet leaves. A
          kid walks by in a Hallowe'en costume, looking lost. Caden
          finds the address: an old, narrow, very tall, very dark
          building. There's a piece of looseleaf paper with the
          handwritten note "Death in family. God relieve our grief."
          taped to the front door. He approaches the tenant buzzers and
          buzzes 31Y. The name on the apartment is Capgras. The door
          buzzes.

          It's small. The walls are panelled with ancient, scarred
          wood. Caden presses "31." The doors close; the elevator
          ascends, swaying and creaking. The doors open on 17; nobody
          gets on. As they begin to close:

<b>          FAINT FARAWAY VOICE
</b>          Hold it. Hold it, please.
          Caden reaches for the "door open" button but doesn't press
          it. The doors close and the elevator continues its shaky
          ascent. The doors open on 31 and Caden exits.

          Sound of the elevator descending. Caden heads down the long
          hall, looking at apartment numbers. He gets to the end and
          is only at 31J. He turns and heads back. The elevator is
          ascending again. As he passes the elevator door, it opens
          and a very old, feeble-looking man or woman steps out.

          behind him. Caden looks behind him and smiles awkwardly.

          He picks up his pace, trying to be casual about it. He

          Caden, wearing a pair of magnifying glasses that flip up and
          down, enters a crowded gallery of people wearing similar
          glasses. The paintings are microscopic. Museum visitors use
          the special glasses to study the paintings. There's a wall
          inscribed "Small Miracles: The Paintings of Adele Lack."

          woman. He comes to a wall titled: "Women I Love." He sees
          a self-portrait of Adele, a portrait of Maria, a portrait of
          Olive, naked and covered in tattoos. Then he comes to a
          portrait entitled "Ellen Bascomb." He steps back for a
          second, unable to look. The people behind him are impatient.
          Finally he flips the glasses and studies the painting. Ellen
          appears to be a chubby, 40 year old white woman, her mousy
          brown hair tied back in a kerchief. She is naked and
          spreading her vulva for the viewer. She has a kind face and
          what appears to be an appendectomy scar.

          Caden sits with Hazel at a table facing the giant, open
          apartment building structure. An actress plays Claire. She
          sits at the kitchen table of her apartment with an actor
          playing the actor. They both hold scripts and read from
          Needleman in a Haystack. Sammy is in front of the building,
          looking up. Caden looks troubled. Tammy sits to the side of
          Hazel and studies her. Every once in a while, Hazel self-
          consciously glances over at Tammy, who does not avert her
          gaze.

          Caden, hooked up to pumps, tries to sleep on the floor,

          Sammy walks down the hall followed by Tammy. He stops at

          "It's obvious he's a substitute for
          me." I think then Hazel could have
          a good moment where she cries or
          gets angry. I'm not sure which
          yet, but it feels dramatically
          sound.

          It's sweltering. Caden sits on his stoop, holding some dead
          flower petals, watching the world pass by. People are sick,
          angry. Some people wear gas masks. Government vehicles with
          strange symbols and gun turrets drive by. A woman walks a
          naked man on a leash. He defecates on the sidewalk. A wild-
          eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden. As
          he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden
          sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's
          show. It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like
          the one Caden's in. In the painting, a man in a white t-
          shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden. The
          flower petals blow away. Caden tries to limp after them.

          Caden weeps inconsolably at the director's table, Michael the
          pre-Hazel assistant is back, neat and efficient-looking, but
          old now. Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The
          scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth
          aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking
          coughs. Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to
          the director's table. Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair-
          back. She casually pulls it off and tries it on. Caden
          watches. She looks so much like Hazel now, it's unbearable.
          He looks away. Millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket.

          Caden, in "Director Wig," and Michael watch Millicent,
          dressed Caden-esque, sitting at the director's table. Tammy,
          in Hazel's sweater, sits next to her. They watch the "Sammy
          Funeral" scene replayed with actors playing Tammy playing
          Hazel and an actor playing the stand-in for Sammy playing
          Caden. Tammy has her head in her hands. She looks over at
          Millicent, imploringly.

<b>          TAMMY
</b>          Come over tonight? Please?

<b>          MILLICENT

          They do. It lingers. Millicent looks over at the funeral
          scene. It's dull and static.

</b>          This is tedious. This is nothing.
          Millicent touches Tammy's hand, heads over to the funeral
          scene. She whispers things to some actors, has longer
          conversations with others.

<b>          MILLICENT
</b>          Okay, folks, let's run it!
          The scene comes alive with specific activity: weeping Hazel, 
          a little boy in the back playing with dirt clods, a man and a  
          woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a distance, an old  
          woman with Parkinson's fiddling with Rosary beads, a well- 
          dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite. A 
          minister addresses the mourners. 

<b>          MINISTER 
</b>          Everything is more complicated than  
          you think. You only see a tenth of 
          what is true. There are a million  
          little strings attached to every 
          choice you make; you can destroy 
          your life every time you choose. 
          But maybe you won't know for twenty  
          years. And you'll never ever trace 
          it to its source. And you only get 
          one chance to play it out. Just try  
          and figure out your own divorce. 
          And they say there is no fate, but 
          there is: it's what you create.  
          Even though the world goes on for  
          eons and eons, you are here for a  
          fraction of a fraction of a second.  
          Most of your time is spent being 
          dead or not yet born. But while  
          alive, you wait in vain, wasting 
          years, for a phone call or a letter  
          or a look from someone or something  
          to make it all right. And it never 
          comes or it seems to but doesn't 
          really. And so you spend your time 
          in vague regret or vaguer hope for 
          something good to come along.  
          Something to make you feel 
          connected, to make you feel whole, 
          to make you feel loved.

           pretending I'm ok, just to get  
           along, just for, I don't know why,  
           maybe because no one wants to hear  
           about my misery, because they have

          Caden drifts off to sleep.

<b>          184INT. ELLEN'S KITCHEN - (2050) - MORNING 184
</b>
          A tenement apartment. Ellen, in a terrycloth robe, is at the
          stove making scrambled eggs. Toast pops from the toaster and
          Ellen crosses to get it. She passes a mirror, glances at
          herself, seems momentarily surprised, pushes a wisp of hair
          behind her ear and continues to the toaster. Eric enters.
          He's an unhealthily thin middle-aged man. He doesn't
          acknowledge her, nor she him. He pours himself coffee.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          I'm making eggs.

          Ellen sits on the bed with a cup of coffee and stares out the
          window. There's a city park across the street and she
          watches kids play basketball. She begins to weep.

<b>          186EXT. FIELD - (2050) - DAY 186

          It's spring and a ten year old girl watches her mother as she
          lays out a picnic on a blanket on the ground.

<b>          MOTHER
</b>          Ellen, why do you look so serious?

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          I'm going to remember this moment
          for the rest of my life, mama. And
          in exactly twenty years, come here
          with my daughter and have exactly
          the same picnic.

          Ellen lies in bed watching Eric sleep next to her.

<b>          ELLEN
</b>          There was supposed to be something
          else. I was to have something. A
          calm. A love. Children. A child,
          at least. Children. Meaning. I
          am always on the verge, never more
          than a tiny shove from tears. I
          can feel them in my chest now.
          That squeezing pressure. And it
          is so tempting to let go, but I am
          afraid, the next time maybe, I will
          never stop crying. I miss my
          husband even though he is lying
          here. He hates me. Oh God. I
          have disappointed him and he hates
          me. The one person who should be
          able to see me and he won't look.
          He will never look again.

          Caden looks over. No note from Adele. He gets out of bed,
          glances in the mirror, seems surprised by his reflection.

          turns off the light, and lies on his back with his eyes open.

          out the earpiece and looks at it, shakes it, then slips it
          back in his ear. Nothing. He waits. In the distance he
          hears wailing and gun shots.

          abandoned. Caden passes the occasional body on the street.
          Fires smolder in buildings. The streets are flooded with
          sewer water. Buildings are draped with massive tarps. Behind
          a fence are piles of bodies.

          catch up with her.

          from his nose. The woman holds him, gently takes off his
          wig, and strokes his sparse hair. He looks out over her
          shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the
          warehouse. His rheumy eyes light up.
