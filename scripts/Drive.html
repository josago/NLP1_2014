           We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only
           as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
           the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.

           A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
           routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -

           DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
           in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
           packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
           cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
           Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.

           Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
           bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
           out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
           way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle

           The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
           only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
           passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
           Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
           carefully, letting other cars overtake.

           elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
           pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
           meet briefly, before Driver walks on.

           Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
           apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
           sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
           tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.

           Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
           the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
           shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
           lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
           vintage cars.

           SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
           follows him past rows of vintage cars.

           They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
           arrive at a plain looking Impala.

           The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
           Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
           of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
           9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.

           A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
           Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
           signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
           making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
           the basketball commentator is getting more excited.

           buried!...
                         
           Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
           scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
           Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
           commentary now.

           Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
           doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
           bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
           pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
           blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
           The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.

           commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
                         
           The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
           going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
           minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
           bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
           without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.

           The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
           scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
           His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
           what's happened to his partner.
                         
           Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
           his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
                         
           Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
           fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
           few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.

           Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
           Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
           speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
           masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
           his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
           his police scanner crackles to life.

           Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He

           The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
           out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
           It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
           probing to see if there's anyone out there.

           taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
           there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the

           at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
           won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
           through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
           shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.

           anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
           the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
           chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
                         
           Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
           helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
           just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
           closer and closer.
                         
           Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
           there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
           slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
           chopper's searchlights spot them.

           The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
           crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
           can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of

           Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
           Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
           factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
           The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the

           There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
           behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
           still playing.

           The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a
           trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car
           approaching in the opposite direction.

           The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
           Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
           turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.

           Driver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the
           opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in
           the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.

           Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
           smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
           glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
           overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
           its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
                         
           Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
           of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around
           him as he guns down Figueroa.

           The terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the
           barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a
           ticket and roars into the parking lot.

           going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
           into a free parking space.

           anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into
           the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places.

           climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches
           them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the
           Impala himself and heads towards another car.

           Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping
           anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights
           into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers
           sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making
           his getaway.

           Driver's face is fixed ahead, sunglasses hiding his eyes. As we
           PULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's
           uniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several

           reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP
           GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.
                         
           Driver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN

</b>           Doesn't have to be. The big money teams
           burn through three, four million a year but
           that's `cause they're using half a dozen
           test drivers and a stable of cars.

</b>           Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need
           is a hard-used stock car. We start off with
           the small-town action then work our way up.
           There's close to two thousand events out
           there and once we make the Show we're
           talking millions.

           eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is
           browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her
           is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack
           of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly
           picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single
           snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy
           turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle
           before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.

           Driver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of
           groceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park.
           Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine.
           She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening
           the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix.
           Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful.

           frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help.

           Benicio watches curiously as Driver gets off the couch and
           kneels beside the TV.

</b>           This is pretty complicated. You watching?
                         
           Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and
           the interference stops.

           Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears
           the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her
           waitress's uniform, and answers it.
                         
<b>                          IRENE

           Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens
           to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.
           Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads
           over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN
           who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.

           a smile but still looking distracted.

           She tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even
           though it hits him like a sledgehammer.

           Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say
           anything, driving in silence.
                         
           Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a
           stop.
                         
           Inside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at
           Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light,
           something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness.
                         
           She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the
           back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.
                         
           The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare
           out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her
           hand, as if nothing's happened.
                         
           Outside the lights change to green.

           Irene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his
           FRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his
           arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests.

           His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and
           agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend
           Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable.

           A smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car

           Standard considers a moment, then shakes his head.
                         
<b>                          STANDARD
</b>           I gotta do this for them...
                         
           He forces a smile, slips on his sunglasses, then finally opens
           the door.

           Driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of
           foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his
           stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away.
                         
           He casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest
           details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of
           overlooking buildings.
                         
           The white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop
           windows, hiding everything inside.
                         
           The police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver
           listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the
           engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading
           for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.
                         
           He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something.
           Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle
           glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different
           from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out.
           For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers
           and racing tires.
                         
           Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from
           the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting
           Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.
                         
           But there's no sign of them.
                         
           The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his
           instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,
           thinking of Irene.
                         
           Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,
           Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.

           He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the
           crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on
           his face as he spins around.
                         
           A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in
           an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The
           force of the bullets sends Standard flying.
                         
           Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from
           his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into
           the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look
           at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots
           crack behind him.
                         
           As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly
           comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.
                         
<b>          82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82

           Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on
           his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just
           following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips
           open the gym bag, then stares in shock.
                         
<b>                          BLANCHE

           much money!...
                         
           There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
           inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,
           but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an
           intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running
           them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler
           draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.
                         
<b>                          BLANCHE
</b>           Move for Chrissakes!...
                         
           Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the
           corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't
           move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start
           honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at
           speed.
                         
           The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
                         
           Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no
           match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He
           weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between
           himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for
           move, staying on his tail.
                         
           In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.

           Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
           deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make
           the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose
           pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. 
                         
           Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and
           regains control of his car.
                         
           The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
           him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver
           pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the
           Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
                         
           Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,
           Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang
           closing fast.
                         
           It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated
           for an instant.
                         
           The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
                         
           Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
           construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his
           pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,
           spinning 270 degrees.
                         
           The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the
           maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a
           corner he can't control. 
                         
           The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
           sickening crunch of metal on metal.
                         
           Driver guns the motor and speeds away.

           Driver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking
           through the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery
           yet. He zips up the bag and heads out.

           As she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed
           where she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped
           open as if she's called someone recently.
                         
           Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette
           of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door
           handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly
           there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.
                         
           Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door.
           He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way.

           Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts
           through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her
           head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a
           big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom
           window where he just shot her.
                         
           Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he
           can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The
           hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his
           forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
                         
           Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
           the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as
           they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls
           the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the
           hitman and grabs his shotgun.

           Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --
           firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks
           up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
           doll.
                         
           The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
           it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and
           his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter
           all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
           man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.
                         
           Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his
           pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.

           He hears Cook striding impatiently towards the door now. He
           waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face.
                         
           Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing
           him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a
           heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's
           left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face.
           Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery.

           it too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the
           door but Driver couldn't care less.

           bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds
           what he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the

           She turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open,
           revealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but
           we do. He smiles, pretending to look confused.

           Driver and Irene ride down in silence, their eyes fixed on each
           other. Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but
           Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights
           on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they
           reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for
           him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the
           darkness of the parking lot. Driver follows Irene, the two of
           them heading in the opposite direction.

           She holds his gaze with regret. Driver's about to respond when
           suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his
           eye.
                         
           A beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling
           her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of
           the darkness, opening fire with his automatic.
                         
           Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other
           parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering
           her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.
                         
           More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the
           car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
                         
           Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan
           Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of
           parked cars.

           Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She
           looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if
           all her worst fears have been confirmed.
                         
           Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps
           approaching.
                         
           He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and
           runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.
                         
           Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up
           the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,
           reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
                         
           Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
           chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
           and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
                         
           Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
           footsteps.
                         
           Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the
           time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his
           pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
           car.
                         
           Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
           him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
                         
           Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
           picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
                         
           Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
           resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
           him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
                         
           The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
           Tan Suit's skull.
                         
           Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
           elevator, framed against the light.
                         
           She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.
                         
           Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The
           elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.

           Driver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting
           it just above the left rear wheel.

           The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in
           the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the
           tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards.

           skids to a stop near the overturned wreck.

           unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.

           Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the
           pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach
           but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the
           other passengers are dead, then heads on.

           Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He
           looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps
           running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear
           clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
                         
           Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the
           ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves
           and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries
           to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.

           Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more
           and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any
           hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,
           barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces
           Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.
                         
           They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver
           silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.
           Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in
           him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then
           grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino
           splutters as Driver lets him up again.

           until Nino's body finally stops thrashing.

           Bernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a
           part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's
           no trace of emotion in his voice.

           He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring
           himself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion,
           wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down.

           Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's
           hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into
           Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this
           time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to
           his throat.
                         
           Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something
           like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking
           deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he
           dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then
           Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.
                         
           Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and
           puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut.

           We're looking down on an enormous parking lot, hundreds of
           different colored vehicles gleaming down below. Driver pulls
           into the lot, searching for a place to park.

           Driver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood-
           soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and
           hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood
           dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets
           off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on
           his cell-phone.
