</b>          CLOSEUP: A slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard,
          in teacherly cursive.
<b>          
</b>          We PULL BACK to REVEAL STARLA GRANT, a stunningly beautiful
          Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing
          out, "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"
<b>          
</b>          Starla glances at the classroom of high school students.
          She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking,
          but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the
          class.
<b>          
</b><b>                                   STARLA
</b>                     When Darwin said 'fittest,' he
                     didn't necessarily mean the
                     strongest or the most intelligent,
                     or any one trait -- he merely meant
                     those organisms most well-suited
                     to their environment.
<b>          
</b>          The boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks.
          KYLIE STRUTEMYER, a pretty student, notices a BOY beside
          her drawing Starla, only without her clothes. She hits
          him. He CHUCKLES.
<b>          
</b><b>                                   STARLA
</b>                     We humans think we're more fit,
                     more evolved, because we're smarter.
                     But we're neophytes. We've been
                     around two million years, give or
                     take. The cockroach has been here
                     for 350 million. You tell me who's
                     the more successful species.
<b>          
</b>          A BOY raises his hand.

<b>          
</b>          Some of the kids LAUGH at the boy.   Starla pauses, about
          to answer, when the BELL RINGS.

          one that reads: "DEER SEASON STARTS TODAY!" We're in the
          center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed
          small town. Today's a big day, as HUNTERS from far and
          near crowd the streets in their massive pickups.
<b>          
</b>          MEN spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of
          ammunition. OLD HUNTERS with faces like prunes stand
          outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk. A MAN WITH FEW
          TEETH has a dead deer strung out across the back of his
          truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose.
<b>          
</b>          JACK, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving
          through town in his big old Cadillac. He comes upon a
          hunter's truck, double-parked, jamming up traffic. Jack
          jams on his HORN.

</b>          Jack turns to see a MOTHER and her two CHILDREN on the
          sidewalk, listening and staring in shock.

</b>                    Mornin', Mayor.
<b>          
</b>          Jack smiles, a bit embarrassed. Jack notices a group of
          HUNTERS on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something
          up in the sky.
<b>          
</b>          He looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth.

          Starla's pretty student, is among them. She and her FRIEND
          are looking up at the falling meteor.

</b><b>          EXT. HORSE RANCH - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A RANCHER with a cleft palate turns his head to see the
          meteor, much closer to him. It's rushing down toward the
          treetops of a nearby forest.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  3.

</b><b>          
</b>          A framed wedding photograph of a very young Starla and a
          large man is sitting on a desk. The photo TREMBLES
          LIGHTLY, with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth.
<b>          
</b>          GRANT GRANT, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties,
          notices the photos on his desk moving. He looks up from
          his desk and out his door, where there's a GLASS WORKSHOP.
          Two WORKERS are carrying a large pane of glass, looking
          relieved they didn't drop it.

</b>          Grant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders
          with a Sharpie.

          handsome Chief of Police, WALLY, an older,   toad-like cop,
          TREVOR, a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and   MARGARET, a
          mannish cop -- are standing stock-still in   the station
          parking lot. They CHUCKLE.

</b>          The Waitress nods back through the service window, into
          the kitchen, where a large DOE is hopping around. A
          DISHWASHER stands on the counter, YELPING with fear.

</b>          Bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer
          toward it.

                    through the back door any chance
                    he gets.
<b>          
</b>          Wally and Margaret LAUGH. Trevor snatches a dish-towel
          and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. The scared doe
          leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          The animal kicks off a pot, which hits Margaret.

<b>          
</b>          As the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped
          in a telephone cord.
<b>          
</b>          The cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in
          place. Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for
          the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.
<b>

</b>          The other cops step away.   Bill steps slowly toward the
          doe, speaking calmly.
<b>          
</b><b>                                  BILL
</b>                    It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's
                    gonna hurt you.
<b>          
</b>          The doe looks at him, settling a bit.   His voice seems to
          be soothing her. Bill gets closer.
<b>          
</b><b>                                  BILL
</b>                    That's right. Just gonna pull
                    this cord out. It's gonna be all
                    right.
<b>          
</b>          The cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe,
          breathing heavily, becomes still. Bill scoops close past
          her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall.
<b>          
</b>          Bill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking
          Bill over, and streaks out the back door.
<b>          
</b>          Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway
          and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond,
          dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.

</b>          Grant takes a big bite of food, stuffing his mouth.

</b>          Starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her
          hair. She uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling.

<b>          
</b>          Grant crawls on top of Starla. He kisses her and grabs
          her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without

</b>          Grant, peeved, gets off of her. He sits on the edge of

          a cigarette. Grant stares at her, trying to figure out
          who she is. She slides off her stool.

          out.
<b>

</b><b>          EXT. SHADED CREEK - LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          Grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable,
          downing a six pack.
<b>          
</b>          He throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances
          down and sees particles flowing down the river.
<b>          
</b>          Grant slides off the boulder. He kneels and examines the
          particles. They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down
          between the trees.
<b>          
</b>          Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are
          coming.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  11.
</b><b>          
</b>          He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water
          splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill.
<b>          
</b>          He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on
          the side of the creek. The meteorite is inside the crater,
          but it's cracked into pieces. The rock seems almost
          organic, like a shell. The shimmery specks are part of
          the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing
          downstream.
<b>          
</b>          Grant crouches. He touches the meteorite, and feels some
          sort of goo inside it. It's sticky.
<b>          
</b>          He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the
          crater itself and into the woods.
<b>          
</b>          Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail.
<b>          
</b>          He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something
          is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in
          closer.
<b>          
</b>          A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between
          the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high,
          gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around
          it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts
          and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret
          that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.
<b>          
</b><b>                                   GRANT
</b>                    What the...?
<b>          
</b>          Grant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even
          frightened. He looks around for someone else.
<b>          
</b><b>                                  GRANT
</b>                    Hey, anybody 'round here?   'Lo?
<b>          
</b>          No one answers. Grant looks down at the organism, unsure.
          He picks up a tree branch.
<b>          
</b>          Grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of
          the branch.
<b>          
</b>          Nothing happens.
<b>          
</b>          He does it again.   The thing pulses a little, and surges
          toward Grant.
<b>          
</b>          Grand pokes it again.
<b>          
</b>          A small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity
          in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering
          and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as
          well.
<b>          
</b>          Grant slowly bends down to look at it when --
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          The SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT.   It strikes Grant in the
          stomach.

<b>          
</b>          Grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his
          abdomen. He watches as the spore quivers and disappears
          inside him.
<b>          
</b>          He clutches his stomach, SCREAMS in agony. He falls back
          into the colorful flowers. His body convulses.

          his entire brain crackles with a WHITE ELECTRICAL ENERGY.

          had in years.

          yellowish, and surrounded by veins.

          The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is
          starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. A fuzzy
          bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout.
          A pus oozes out.

</b>          Grant stands in the garage, tearing open the packing, and
          letting the loose meat slide into piles onto the floor,
          muttering:
<b>

          pile.
<b>          
</b>          SOMETHING skitters across the garage and around the pile.
          Grant peers around the pile and sees a RAT nibbling on
          some ribs. He realizes something.

<b>          
</b>          The rat moves away from Grant. But Grant snaps out his
          arm with alarming speed, snatching the rat. It SQUEAKS
          and wriggles in his grip, tearing and biting at him, trying
          to get free.
<b>          
</b>          Grant snaps its neck, and tosses the dead rat onto the
          pile of meat. Continues on.

</b>          She gets out of the car and examines the door. She looks
          down and sees a new padlock, locking the door to the cement

          back, then turns and heads up the stairs. Grant watches
          Starla's fine form from behind, somewhat lustily. But
          his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker,
          and he has a realization.

          a nest. He sits back, looks at it.

<b>          
</b>          Something starts to push Grant's shirt up at his stomach,
          like a bellybutton erection. The thing slips out of his
          shirt -- a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward Starla's
          back.

</b>          Grant looks at the nape of Starla's neck.    Her delicate
          ear. He becomes confused; he softens.

          feeling its way like a blind snake.
<b>          
</b>          The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream
          down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh.
<b>          
</b>          Brenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid --
          pumps through the tubule and into Brenda.
<b>          
</b>          Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms
          there beside him.

          worse, he's been transforming. There are small pustules
          all over his face.

</b>                       Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks,
                       sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here.
                       I had a reaction to a bee sting.
                       He gave me a prescription. Said I
                       should be fine, in a couple days.
<b>          
</b>          Starla stares at him, mute and horrified.

</b>                       Don't look at me like that, baby.
                       Please? I'm gonna go get my...
                       prescription filled.
<b>          
</b>          Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his
          pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt.

<b>          
</b>          He moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked.

</b>          Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting
          on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS
          through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is
          horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous
          pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away.

</b>          Grant doesn't respond.    Brenda's eyes trail back down to
          the meat.
<b>          
</b>          Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested
          pork chop, pulling it toward her.

</b>          We HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the

</b>          Starla nods, distraught. Bill tries to smile kindly before
          he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors'
          homes.

</b>          Starla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked.
<b>          
</b>          She looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage.
          Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what
          appears to be blood drop stains near the door.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          Starla throws open this door. She looks at old, unused
          sports equipment. She grabs an aluminum baseball bat.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          Starla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the
          door to the garage. She hesitates a moment. But then
          she swings the bat at the lock on the door.
<b>          
</b>          She swings it again, GRUNTING.

</b><b>                                                                 34.
</b><b>          
</b>          And again.
<b>          
</b>          Finally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door.
<b>          
</b>          Starla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to
          the floor.
<b>          
</b>          Starla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door
          into the dark garage. As she does, the horrendous stench
          hits her. Terrified, she covers her face with her hand,
          and enters.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Starla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of
          rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets. They are neatly
          divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground
          Beef, Cats, Dogs. The walls and doorway have been heavily
          insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home. She
          looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle,
          his tongue dangling out.

</b>          Starla starts to CRY.
<b>

</b>          She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone.

</b>          As Starla passes the large picture window, she doesn't

          her body. Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he
          pins her hands above her head. He looks into her eyes.
          He's CRYING. His voice and breath are sick and raspy.

          feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it.

<b>          
</b>          Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She
          SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and
          surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from
          under him.
<b>          
</b>          Starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer
          ringing, and scurries behind the couch. She dials 9-1-1.

</b>          Starla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from
          behind. He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her
          back. He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as
          his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her
          like a snake.
<b>          
</b>          Starla gasps for air. Her face turns purple.   She hears

</b>          Grant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows,
          SCREECHING in anger and pain. Starla falls to the floor.

          cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown
          off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass,
          trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls
          forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and
          sees...

          monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump
          of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various
          tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown
          eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease,
          he now seems to BE the disease itself.

</b>          The diseased Grant slithers through the grass just a few
          feet beside Margaret and the Older Cop. They duck below
          the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart
          attacks.
<b>

          protest when he gets too close, and steps back.
<b>          
</b>          The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into

          their guns at the ready.

          posse stop, terrified.
<b>          
</b>          Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross
          breathing. Deep: In, out.

</b>          Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla
          to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS.
<b>          
</b>          Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away.
          His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again
          drags it toward the forest.
<b>          
</b>          While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy
          nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at
          him.
<b>

</b>          Pause.   Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other.
<b>          
</b>          And then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up
          the front of the man's body, and back.
<b>          
</b>          The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly
          in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two
          different sides of his split head look down in disbelief
          as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he
          topples over.

<b>          
</b>          Grant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the
          cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the
          forest.
<b>

</b>          Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and
          horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as
          they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with
          flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces
          with the bottom of their shirts.

          knocks most of them down.

</b>          Trevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway,

          He gags on it. His eyes flip back up into his head, and
          his body starts to spasm.

<b>          
</b>          One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he
          slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face.
<b>          
</b>          Starla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the
          parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls
          back onto the floor.
<b>          
</b>          A parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when,
          suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to
          the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla.
<b>          
</b>          Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand
          firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites
          away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his
          free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies
          and faces as closely together as possible so the things
          don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them,
          flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight
          their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to
          himself and Starla.

          the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound.
<b>          
</b>          Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from
          Starla's mouth. Starla looks around.

</b>          The parasite winds toward her lips. Kylie goes to grab
          it with both hands, but it slips through them. The thing
          slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it.
<b>          
</b>          Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail. Her
          long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there,
          digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it
          from sliding completely into her mouth. It wildly flaps
          its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her.

          to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck
          in the door jamb.

</b>          She doesn't see Wally open his eyes behind her. He sits
          up, and stares over at Starla with milky eyes as she kneels
          down beside the water.
<b>          
</b>          Starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re-
          wetting it.

          of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered
          in darkness.

          the car, trembling, afraid to leave.

          six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the
          field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked.
          Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse.
<b>          
</b>          Bill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased
          Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now,
          smashing the pickup's windows.

<b>          
</b>          Bill turns to see the RANCHER with the cleft palate, now
          diseased, holding a shovel. He swings it into Bill,
          knocking him down.
<b>          
</b>          Kylie SCREAMS. Her family runs in toward them. She looks
          around to see a couple more DISEASED RANCHERS rushing
          toward them through the fields.
<b>          
</b>          The Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the
          shovel to bring it down again.

</b>          Bill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the
          dirt beside him. He yanks the trigger.

</b>          The BLAST hits the Rancher in the foot.    He buckles.

</b>          GLEEKS; that is, he sends a yellowish globby-stream
          shooting out of the back of his throat. The glob SPLASHES
          on Margaret's hand. Margaret SCREAMS, drops the pistol.

</b>          Margaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into

          glob forward and onto her neck. Margaret SCREAMS again,
          grabbing onto her neck.
<b>          
</b>          Margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe,
          as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax.

          stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it.
<b>          
</b>          As Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members

          the rifle at the posse, trembling.

</b>          The police car suddenly stops, jammed between two trees,
          inches from Jack.

          behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed-
          wire fence.
<b>          
</b>          She thrusts it forward, hard; and it pops out the front
          of Jack's neck.

</b>          Jack turns to look at Starla, and topples over into the
          leaves.

                       a-gallon as usual. And he notices

                       He picked up a tire iron, walked
                       straightaway into the garage, and
                       beat my father half to death. You

          on the sides of its head like a goldfish's.

<b>          
</b>          Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to
          scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just
          a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly
          starts to crawl out toward him.
<b>          
</b>          As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on
          her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able
          to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition;
          the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the
          floorboard, pressing on the gas.
<b>          
</b>          The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the
          horned buck's mouth.
<b>          
</b>          Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too
          far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the
          rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into
          Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat,
          and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him,
          knocking the beast back.
<b>          
</b>          The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole
          head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over,
          dead.
<b>          
</b>          Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs
          the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg.
          The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face
          and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the
          telephone wire wrapped around her ankle.
<b>          
</b>          Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her.
<b>          
</b>          He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It
          has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill
          SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight
          on.
<b>          
</b>          Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running
          through the fields toward them.
<b>          
</b>          Starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up
          alongside her friends. Throws open the passenger door.

</b>          An SUV barreling straight towards them.
<b>          
</b>          It SLAMS hard into the side of the Buick.

</b><b>          INT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          The Buick and SUV are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this
          store. Shattered vases and flowers surround them. Glass
          fragments dangle from the window frame. Some fall and
          CLINK to the floor.

</b><b>          
</b>          Starla lifts her battered head from the wheel. She looks
          beside her to see Bill and Trevor, seemingly unconscious.
<b>          
</b>          She looks back at Kylie. The impact has killed her. Her
          neck is bent at an ungodly angle. Bone juts up out of
          her skin.
<b>          
</b>          Starla looks out her rear window and sees the SUV door
          open, and the DISEASED DRIVER stumble out. His body is
          battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her.
          He tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a MUMBLY
          MOAN comes out.
<b>          
</b>          Starla struggles to get out of the car. Eventually, she
          does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass
          from the shattered window, and the water all over the
          floor from the broken vases.
<b>          
</b>          She sees the moaning driver limping toward her.   He's
          still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible.
<b>          
</b>          The driver gets close, ready to grab her. Starla sees a
          metal bar. She grabs it. And SLAMS it into the diseased
          man's shin.
<b>          
</b>          He topples over.
<b>

</b>          Starla looks down at the man, who is very dead.
<b>          
</b>          Starla looks up to see dozens of DISEASED TOWNSFOLK coming
          at her, from down the street, between buildings. They

          shelving.

          she helps.

          over them they can.

          crack in the upper corner of the room.

</b>          Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from
          other cracks in the room as well. They also BLAST at
          them. Dust is all around; they can hardly see.
<b>          
</b>          Bill runs out of ammo. He grabs a hand-held Black and
          Decker electric circular saw and turns it on. He starts
          jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting
          big slices in the floor. They SQUEAK with pain.

          slip inside, trying to pull away more.
<b>          
</b>          Bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers.
<b>          
</b>          An arm pops through the door.    Bill slams the circular

</b>            They surround her. They touch her body, her ass, her
            breasts. Pull on her clothes. She trembles.

                      I know. Don't... hurt... me.
<b>          
</b>            Starla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her
            calf, tasting her.

</b>            A DISEASED MAN grabs the side of her neck and face.

</b>            The diseased townsfolk grab Starla, enveloping her, and
            start dragging her away.

</b>            A few townsfolk remain behind.    They look around for Bill.

            bodies, and a WOMAN chased down and tackled by some
            infected townsfolk.
<b>          
</b>            Some diseased townsfolk wander by Bill, looking for him.
            Bill crouches down so he isn't seen.

</b>            Bill waits for them to pass. When they're gone, Bill
            looks up toward the next street -- he can see the hoard
            moving Starla across that street.
<b>          
</b>            He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her.

            to her hands and knees. They keep pushing her. She
            stumbles back to her feet and moves on. She's almost
            hyperventilating.

            looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front
            yard. Starla gazes up at her home:
<b>          
</b>            The diseased have done a little remodeling. Part of the
            front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive
            thatched woodwork. The front doorway has also been
            partially destroyed. Because of the sloppy reconstruction,
            the roof is caved-in and sloping.
<b>          
</b>            Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of
            the Grants' home, watching out for trouble.

</b><b>            EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>            Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street. He can
            see Starla standing with the diseased. He hides behind
            some shrubs.

</b>          The diseased push Starla up between them, violently, to
          the front door.
<b>          
</b>          Starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house.
          It's pitch black inside. She looks back at the rotting
          faces behind her. And then slowly enters.

</b><b>          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Starla balks at the smell. She looks beside her at the
          garage; the wall has been torn out, and this has become
          Grant's feeding area, with rotten meat, including some
          bodies, in a pile.
<b>          
</b>          Starla steps slowly forward, looking around.

</b><b>          
</b>          Bill looks at the diseased surrounding the Grant home.
          They seem impossible to get through.
<b>          
</b>          Bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty-five feet
          from the Grants'. He makes sure no one's paying attention
          for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked
          car. The diseased don't see him. Bill gazes down the
          street beside him.
<b>          
</b>          The sun is just barely beginning to rise.   They don't
          have much time to move in the darkness.
<b>          
</b>          Bill makes a break for the house next door.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. GRANT KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Starla walks into the kitchen. Cooking supplies and
          condiments are scattered over the floor. She spots a
          meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils.
<b>          
</b>          She glances out the rear window. Diseased people are
          guarding the backyard, looking away from the home.
<b>          
</b>          She grabs the meat thermometer. She snaps the thermometer
          part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal
          spike into the seam of her skirt.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          Suddenly, Starla hears EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD, the song
          she and Grant danced to earlier, starting to play through
          tinny speakers.
<b>          
</b>          Starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she
          can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her.
<b>          
</b><b>                                   STARLA

</b>          Bill has made his way into the backyard. He looks over
          at the Grant home. Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard
          could conceivably see or hear him. He tries the back
          door, but it's locked.
<b>          
</b>          Bill notices a window slightly open.    He starts to push
          it up. It SQUEAKS LOUDLY.
<b>          
</b>          He peers over at the diseased. They don't hear. He throws
          the window up further, and crawls inside the home.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT

</b>          She starts to ascend the stairs.     They CREAK beneath her

          the home next door, walking up the stairs.

<b>          
</b>          Between wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome
          mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom.
<b>          
</b>          In front of him, the SONG ENDS on the CD player. It starts
          into the NEXT SONG on the album. Grant uses one of his
          crusty tentacles to push the back button.

          Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls:
          photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family
          parties.

</b>          Starla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth.

</b>          Grant looks embarrassed.   Starla becomes more brazen.

</b>          Starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again. She

          Grant looks, well, joyful.
<b>          
</b>          And then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and
          JABS it into Grant's eye.

</b>          Grant SCREECHES, blind and bucking.   Starla SLAMS the
          spike into his other eye.

          forehead, where it stays.

</b>          Starla leaps to the window.   She throws open the drapes.

          room in fury.
<b>          
</b>          One tentacle SLAMS Starla against the wall, probably
          breaking a rib or two. Another tentacle SMASHES the CD

</b>          Through the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs.

</b>          Bill SHOOTS Grant with the .38, SHATTERING the glass.

</b><b>          
</b>          Bill hears a quiet RATTLING sound. He looks around him.
          And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a
          distorted piece of Grant's cerebellum. Sticking out of a
          new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill-like spore.
          It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs
          popping out.

          bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around
          them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as
          well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but
          no life remains.

</b>          Starla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual,
          HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS: men and women and children -- going
          about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes.
<b>          
</b>          Bill grabs Starla's hand.   She clenches his tightly.

          Starla glances down. His arm pulls up his shirt, and
          Starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his
          stomach. She turns away, looking around, confused.
<b>
