</b>     We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of
    children's laughter. Excited shrieking.

     A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs
    through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE,
    and sister, ANNE, (10).

     Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head
    skimming along the sheaves.

     REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their
    parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).

<b>                            SIR THOMAS
</b>              I received a formal request for marriage
             today for Anne.
                     (a beat)
              From the Carey family.

    SIR THOMAS indicates to
                         ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.
    Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.

<b>                        LADY ELIZABETH
</b>           But that's wonderful.

<b>                        SIR THOMAS
</b>             I turned it down.

     LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'

<b>                        SIR THOMAS
</b>            And offered them Mary instead.

    SIR THOMAS indicates 
                         MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.
    Pretty. Sweet-natured.

<b>                          SIR THOMAS
</b>           Fnne's too good for William Carey. She
           can do (better than a merchant's son.

<b>                          LADY ELIZABETH
</b>            You underestimate Mary.

<b>                          SIR THOMAS
</b>            Not true. I think she's..the kinder of
           the two. Quite possibly the fairer.

    The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..

<b>                         SIR THOMAS
</b>           But to get ahead in this world, you need
           more than fair looks and a kind heart.

     On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms
    aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.

</b>           No, is this it? This is the end of the

           achieve the same?

    loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..

down his trousers.

MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly
lowers himself on top of her. He enters her.

MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one

face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.

     The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER
     in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake.

     The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS,
     who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS..

     It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not,
     This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end.

     Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome,
     in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest
     COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough,
     intimidating lot.

     Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large
     ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books..

     Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the
     PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS.

     Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's
     weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance,
     etc.

     Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING
     HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an
     assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting.

     And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS,
     and a second STANDARD BEARER..

     by the HOUNDS.

     other side, followed by the DOGS, slipping in the mud, and
     struggling with the brook.

     But, reaching the bottom, the horse leaps across the brook, then
     scrambles up the other side.

</b>     In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the
     Eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood..

     But, in full view of all those in the chapel, the KING continues
     to stare at MARY.

      inally, she looks up. Their eyes meet. MARY blushes, averts her
     gaze. But then, for the first time, she reciprocates. And looks
     back.

     This is witnessed by the QUEEN, and further back, by the DUKE of
     NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN.

     Everyone is pretending to focus on the MASS. But none of them
     can concentrate..

</b>            Are you there?

     Presently, a WOMAN steps into the light. It's ANNE. Dressed in a

     ANNE hands over a purse of coins. They walk to the altar..

<b>                         PRIEST
</b>            And the groom? Is he here?

     Up ahead, the GROOM slowly steps out of the shadows. Now we see

</b>     Back at court: the service ends.

     Everyone in the Royal Household filters out of the church. But
     it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered..

     The extent of HENRY's affection for MARY is now public knowledge
     evidenced by..

     ..the attention SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK now receive from CARDINAL
     WOLSEY and THOMAS CROMWELL, and the way in which QUEEN KATHERINE
     and her SPANISH LADIES are being neglected.

     MARY allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. Surprised
     at how good it feels. To be the number 1.

</b>     MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a
     beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the
     KING. We can see from MARY's face how much she likes it.

     Presently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. MARY's eyes
     widen in excitement. The King?

     She hurriedly closes the necklace's box. Tucks the letter away
     in a drawer.

     She gets out of bed. Anxiously straightens her hair, then goes
     to the door, to find..

     GEORGE, her brother, who bursts in..

     MUSICIANS play. Large formations of DANCERS perform elaborately
     choreographed moves. Among them we pick out..

     SIR THOMAS BOLEYN stalking the party. Ever watchful. On duty.
     Vigilant. He is distracted by the sight of...

     His son, GEORGE BOLEYN, surrounded by FRANCIS WESTON and his
     FRIENDS. GEORGE is clearly in his element. Laughing in delight.
     Very fond and intimate with FRANCIS WESTON..

     SIR THOMAS looks concerned for the first time.

      n another corner, MARY is in costume, but looking forlorn. She
     watches proceedings with a blank, distant expression. Presently,
     a voice behind her..

retreats into the safety of the shadows. Meanwhile..

All around MARY the crowds part, and a deep voice booms out.

MARY turns to see a SECOND MASKED MAN, (unmistakably the KING),

MARY notices her FATHER is among the masked COURTIERS. His eyes
giving MARY cues..

</b>       It is easy for a man to declare love
       from behind a mask.

</b>       There. There ARE no servants.

MARY's eyes widen. The KING of ENGLAND brings her a drink! MARY
takes a sip of her drink and watches as HENRY goes behind a
screen and begins to remove his costume. His mask.

MARY notices a mirror, and watches in the reflection of the
mirror how HENRY removes the costume and status of KING and
becomes a MAN. Private.

 ENRY visibly unwinds, his facial muscles relax. He breathes out
deeply. His face becomes softer. More gentle. Then he puts on a
comfortable robe, and emerges from behind the screen.

HENRY goes over to a pile of cushions, and flops down - and
smiles at MARY.

<b>                    MARY
</b>       So, this is it? This is where the King
       of England sleeps?

<b>                    HENRY
</b>       And reads. And writes. And finds a few
       moments each day...
              (gestures)
       ...for himself.

HENRY smiles at MARY..

                    HENRY (cont'd)
       You look surprised?

<b>                    MARY
</b>       I am. I suppose it's more..

MARY looks at the bed, the books, the pages of writing on the
desk..

<b>                    MARY
</b>       ..simple than I imagined.

<b>                     ENRY
</b>       There's no need for show. I am only ever
       here alone.

<b>                    MARY
</b>       And yet you invite me here?

<b>                    HENRY
</b>       Because I trust you.

<b>                    MARY
</b>       You hardly know me.

`Thank you'. Bites into the apple..

            father ordered it. As a duty. To keep
            the alliance with Spain. And she is a
            remarkable woman. And wife.

     resisting. Then harder..

      ensing this, the KING picks MARY up and leads her to the
     canopied bed, and lays her down..

     They begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with
     WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine..

     MARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets..

     piece of livestock..

            defend an interesting opinion. She must
            know her music, must be energetic and
            entertaining - in company and in bed.
            That's how he likes his women. And if
            ever she's in any doubt as to how to
            conduct herself, or what to do next -
            she should simply watch the Queen. That
            woman kept him from straying for eleven
            years. And the effort almost killed her.

      ut SIR THOMAS has not heard. He is distracted. He watches from
     a palace window as, in a stableyard down below..

     GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound
     of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the
     stable-boys..

     SIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace
     together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy
     between them..

dances with a radiant, triumphant JANE PARKER. GEORGE's eyes
meet those of FRANCIS WESTON across the room.

each other. Locked to one another. Blissfully unaware of and
uninterested in anyone else. Silently counting the minutes
before they can tear off one another's clothes..

hisses through a fixed smile..

     MARY pulls away. But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY
     sees this from across the room..

</b>            I know you look at me with contempt.

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN gets to his feet..

<b>                    SIR THOMAS
</b>       It's my elder daughter, Anne, your
       Majesty. She has returned to court.

<b>                    HENRY
</b>       What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one
       that almost killed me?
              (a beat)
       You allowed her back?

<b>                    SIR THOMAS
</b>       The time abroad has done her good, your
       Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much
       improved.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>       Really..?

HENRY looks down the table..

<b>                    HENRY
</b>       Well, come on. Where are you, other
       Boleyn girl? Show your face.

ANNE slowly gets to her feet. HENRY looks up. When he sees
ANNE's face, his face falls..

ANNE is a woman transformed. Gone are the simple clothes, puppy
fat and lack of confidence.

ANNE has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in
daring French clothes.

 er hood is half-crescent, and reveals the hair. Her neckline
plunges sexily. Her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring
flashes of arm and elbow..

Like every other red-blooded MAN in the room, HENRY is utterly
mesmerised. Speechless..

<b>                    HENRY
</b>       So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we
       might hear and judge for ourselves?

ANNE dark, intelligent eyes stare back at HENRY. Suddenly, all
sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though
they are the only two people in the room..

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       I was just giving my thoughts on the new
       French King.

<b>                      HENRY

</b>       Hah!

<b>                    ANNE

       rivalry he can barely think.

<b>                    HENRY
</b>        eally? And who is this rival?

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       A neighbouring King, who's name one is
       forbidden to mention at court. Whose
       reputation haunts him in his thoughts
       and dreams.

 ipples of laughter, as people guess..

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       Whose armies and navy thwart his every
       endeavour. Whose physical and
       intellectual endowments are known far
       and wide.

 ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this..

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       In order to restore his confidence, this
       French King spends a fortune on anything
       that glitters, on building of castles
       with large towers..

ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications..

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       But these symbols of wealth and virility
       fail to convince. Talk among the ladies
       at court in France suggests..

<b>                    HENRY
</b>       What?

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       That in this department too, the King
       has his shortcomings.

ANNE's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). HENRY
stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?

ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress.

MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way.
Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair..

No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands.
PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments..

Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS..

<b>                    SIR THOMAS
</b>       Any moment, your Grace.

But the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE. Suddenly, it's as
if all sound, all vision disappears, except for ANNE. He stands
beside her..

All around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth
unfolding; but for all their connection with it, HENRY and ANNE
might as well be in a rose garden..

MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and
MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then..

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       Then don't acknowledge the child.

HENRY is thrown..

<b>                    HENRY

With a blood-curdling scream, MARY finally gives birth. SIR
THOMAS and NORFOLK crowd into the room, anxious to see..

SIR THOMAS turns towards HENRY, beaming with happiness..

<b>                    SIR THOMAS
</b>       It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong,
       healthy boy.

HENRY's face: a boy? His eyes fill with emotion. This is what he
has waited for. A son.

ANNE notices his conflict, and prompts him again..

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       What my sister has given you, I could,
       too.

HENRY looks at the BABY, then turns to face ANNE. His eyes are
full of conflict, then..he silently nods.

ANNE's face breaks out in a smile..

<b>                    ANNE
</b>       Very well.

Then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is,
HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it.

The audible sound of gasps. MARY watches in horror as HENRY
falls to his knees and kisses ANNE's hand..

     Instead, MARY's eyes meet ANNE's.

     ANNE's eyes stare back. The ultimate moment of revenge.

       barely perceptible smile of satisfaction, then ANNE turns and
     goes.

     The MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS stare at one another, visibly
     embarrassed by what they have just witnessed.

      The cheers from the loyal PEOPLE who are waiting outside ring
      through the court. HENRY looks dark, thunderous. He storms out

             simply proceed without her.

      A LAWYER gets to his feet. The trial begins..

             to reject the Catholic Church? And his

<b>                          SIR THOMAS
</b>             Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome

      In the gardens outside, are ANNE and YOUNG HENRY, playing.

      The KING's face: it's as if all sound goes silent. He stares,
      transfixed, at the boy. He hears nothing except YOUNG HENRY's
      laughter. He sees nothing except YOUNG HENRY's golden locks.

      MARY watches from a distance, her heart cracking as HENRY
      dismisses CROMWELL and the LAWYERS, and goes out to join ANNE

The KING threads his way through COURTIERS and ENTERTAINERS.

Inimidated.

drawn, frightened, and tired. An unmistakable echo of QUEEN
KATHERINE at the masked ball earlier.

       If it's a boy, the King will have been
       vindicated in getting rid of his first
       wife, and his authority will be
       unassailable. But if it isn't. Or if,
       God forbid, she miscarries.

 EORGE indicates HENRY, who's face is also drawn, dark,
malevolent, suspicious. Barely recognisable.

</b>       The King will have to move swiftly to

             Because I couldn't bear to be the Other

      ANNE shrugs..

<b>                          ANNE

      The sound of approaching footsteps. ANNE looks at MARY, suddenly
      frightened..

<b>                          ANNE

      The two SISTERS fall into an emotional embrace as the JAILOR's
      keys turn in the lock..

<b>                          MARY

      ANNE takes a deep breath. Tries to look serene..

</b>      A roar of the crowd. ANNE, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is
      violently jostled and spat at as she's marched across Tower Hill
      to the scaffold. She shoots MARY an anxious look across the
      crowds..
<b>      M
</b>      MARY shoots a signal, "Don't worry." ANNE climbs the steps, and
      faces the CROWDS. Finally the jeers subside..

<b>                          ANNE
</b>             I...I come here to die...a loyal
             subject..

      More spit, jeers and abuse. MARY stands on tiptoe, cranes her
      neck. Anxiously scans the CROWDS for the GUARDS that will free
<b>      ANNE..
</b>
<b>                          MARY

</b>             ..I..I do not blame the King. Never was
             there a more just or goodly Lord..

      Presently, MARY sees two SOLDIERS pushing through the CROWDS
      towards her. Her heart leaps..

<b>                          ANNE
</b>             ..I beg God's forgiveness and his

      ANNE looks up to see the SOLDIERS reaching MARY, and handing her
      a letter. ANNE smiles in relief. MARY opens the letter and
      reads..

</b>      THOMAS CROMWELL, the former assistant to WOLSEY, who has now
      replaced him, sits at his desk, writing the letter..

<b>                          CROMWELL (V.O.)

</b>      MARY continues to read the letter, as ANNE is forced to kneel by
      the EXECUTIONER..

<b>                          CROMWELL (V.O.)
</b>             "But you risked your life coming to

             was tried and found guilty, her crimes
             were high treason and she deserves to
             die. Cromwell."

      MARY, who is reading, looks up in horror..

<b>                          MARY
</b>             No!

      ANNE looks up. She sees the look on MARY's face.

      MARY's eyes.

      ANNE's eyes.

      `WHOOSH', the masked EXECUTIONER swings his sword. ANNE is
      beheaded. MARY almost chokes..

      The CROWD falls eerily silent. A stunned calm descends on Tower
      Green. Nothing but the sound of the wind.

      MARY sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. She
      falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms..

      ..WILLIAM STAFFORD, who has followed her to London.

      Suddenly the CROWDS burst into life. A great, bloodthirsty ROAR
      echoes around Tower Green as ANNE's head is lifted aloft..

      WILLIAM STAFFORD carries MARY in his arms. They walk against the

      watch the spectacle..
