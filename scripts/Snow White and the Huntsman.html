          From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket
          of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful
          WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object.

</b>          Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen
          was admiring the falling snow when she saw
          a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
          The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The
          Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.

<b>          ERIC (V.0.)
</b>          Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and
          three drops of blood fell.
          BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD
          lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
          The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.

<b>          ERIC (V.0.)
</b>          And because the red seemed so alive against
          the white, she thought, if only I had a
          child as white as snow, lips as red as
          blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and
          all with the strength of that rose.
          A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --

          We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and
          PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of
          water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms --
          until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother.

<b>          ERIC (V.O.)
</b>          Soon after, a daughter was born to the
          Queen and was named "Snow White."
          With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud
          father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King
          cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.

</b>          And she was adored throughout the kingdom
          as much for her defiant spirit as for her

          A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE,

          Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,
          then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He
          tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable.

</b>          It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.
          Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels
          down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie,
          calming its flapping before she picks it up.
          High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on.

          SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William
          dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are
          lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a
          BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens,
          HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --

<b>          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
</b>          Hurry, William! Hurry!
          They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in
          the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead --

<b>          5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5

           A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It
           stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.

          Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen
          turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow
          White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's
          smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken.

<b>          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
</b>          We found it in the woods.
          The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King
          looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and
          carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the
          doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks.
          The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing.

          So does the Queen, holding back her tears.

          Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his
          back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister
          gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and
          offers it to Snow White.
          He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding.
          Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a
          huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the
          tree and they fall to the ground.
          And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,
          DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony.

          The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King
          Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken.
          A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers
          and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move
          aside.

           From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a
           clearing. At the head is --
          King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a
          line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at--
          Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are
          silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless
          warriors.
          King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -

          King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides
          forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to
          him.
          The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of
          the battlefield. When they meet --
          Hand to hand combat at its most brutal.
          King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR

<b>          SHATTERS LIKE GLASS.

          shattering, evaporating.
          Strange.
          DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and
          furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now
          that quiet.
          The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
          SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until
          all that is left in the field is --

          King Magnus with the spoils of victory.
          A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there.
          King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When
          he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to
          look inside.

          King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars, then with a
          mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters.

          Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the
          King kneels beside the terrified woman.

</b>          What is your name, my lady?
          Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's
          his beloved Queen behind the veil. Gently, he lifts her veil.
          It's not his wife, but the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.

          We get our first good look at grown Snow White as she shaves
          wood for a fire. She's done this every day for years. A

          in her bed and pretends to sleep.
          A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds
          later the door CLANGS SHUT.
          As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her
          cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell.

          The Generals and Finn snap to attention. She stops and stares
          at TWO MEN, the captured insurgents.
          THOMAS, a grizzled old rebel, looks badly bruised and beaten,
          while his handsome son, LAIN, is unmarked. They both stare at

<b>                         (TO THOMAS)

          He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his
          ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead.

          Snow White paces in her cell, frantic.
          Two magpies appear in the window. She looks at them and
          watches as they flap their wings. Like they're trying to
          tell her something. She moves toward them.
          They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside
          the cell window, hovering there.
          She is confused but notices --
          A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover.
          Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the
          loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by
          bit, breaks free.
          She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when --
          The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid --

          Finn unlocks her door, leaving the key in the lock, and walks
          into the cell. He stands there until she turns her head
          slightly to him.
          She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she
          tries to lure him closer with her eyes.

          hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through
          the courtyard toward the portcullis.
          The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to
          follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at
          the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS.
          As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the
          darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through
          the opening, running towards the Portcullis instead.

          Snow White swims ashore. She looks up and sees a maze of large
          rocks stretching out. She sets off in one direction when the two
          MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another
          direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE
          waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to
          climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash.

          boarded up.
          A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry,
          desperate - see her approach and move out to greet her.
          She stops her horse for a moment, gazing past tears at the
          devastation and the state of villagers all around her.
          At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer
          their faces reveal dangerous desperation and --
          She gallops off, looking back to see the Queen's men giving

          from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates --

          Shadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then
          suddenly loses her footing. She rears -- throwing Snow White
          onto the safety of solid ground.
          Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not
          wanting to endanger her life. She tries again but the horse
          backs farther away from her. Slowly they're separated by the
          swirling fog --
          As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear.

          in terror. One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog,
          frightening off the others.
          Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too
          afraid to enter the forest.

          all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in --
          A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She
          coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She
          hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now --
          The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her
          through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing
          out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her
          like a hand and now she runs --
          More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles
          again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the
          trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on
          her until she finally passes out.

          Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight.
          Eric lands a body blow to Broch, who doubles over. Eric
          comes in for the kill, winds up and swings -
          Missing Broch but hitting a HORSE on the ass. It kicks its
          legs, sending him flying. He lands in a heap and drops his
          head back.
          Hands lift him and --
          Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few
          seconds before he comes to and lifts out his head, eyes still
          closed.

          RAVENS perch on the ledges and LURCHERS scamper about.
          Eric, still drunk, filthy, damp clothes, face bruised, enters
          the room, eyes the ravens, then looks at --
          Ravenna on her throne. She watches him curiously. He's more
          interested in the aged scullery maids, including Rose, who are
          staring at him accusingly. He has no idea who they are or what
          he's done wrong. Finally he comes before the Queen, sizing her
          up like a tavern beauty.

          The Guards keep inching toward Eric.
          Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts
          slowly backing up.
          Finn pulls his own sword and approaches.
          Four against one. As they burst toward him he tosses Snow
          White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife
          into the chest of one of the Guards, who crumbles.
          Eric reaches behind, grabs both hatchets and faces off with
          the others.
          They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he
          raises a hatchet, throws it --
          Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no
          wound. Finn pulls it out, laughs and throws it at the
          huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree.
          Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They
          notice her exit but keep fighting.
          Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn
          manages to plunge a sword in his side.

          Eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other
          Guards, who look from Finn, who is dazed, to Eric, who is

          A single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna,
          looking weaker than before, stares at it quietly, as if she
          were gazing at Snow White. She reaches out and crushes the
          blossom in her hand, turning it into ash.

          that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other
          trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the
          group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in
          the forest.
          William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling
          CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees
          without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the
          others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on.

          Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens
          -- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds
          circling on the distant horizon.
          Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope.

          Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in
          the shallow creek below -- among the CARCASSES OF SLAIN
          ANIMALS. The troll roars and comes after them, swinging its
          giant stone fists. Eric grabs Snow White and runs --
          As the troll catches up with them, Eric shoves her out of the
          way and draws his hatchets.

          Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks
          as a mighty arm sweeps over him, darts between the troll's
          legs, and hacks at its leg with his hatchets.
          The Troll falters a bit then --
          A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the
          creek.
          Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the
          ground, his wound bleeding again, at the troll's mercy. She
          hesitates, still terrified, then runs back.
          The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands
          to crush him when --
          Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE!
          The Troll looks around in surprise. So does Eric. A beat,

          almost gentle in its monstrous gaze, slowly losing her fear.
          The troll stares at her too, confused, then slowly pacified,
          until it finally turns and strides away.
          Eric stares in disbelief. Snow White is rooted to the spot,
          also confused but strangely moved by what's happened. Eric
          rises to his feet painfully and heads over, taking her by the

          It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back

          Eric looks at her a moment, then suddenly turns away as he
          sees her expression change --
          GHOSTLY BACKLIT FIGURES EMERGE on the banks of the marsh now,
          holding bows and arrows. Eric looks around for an escape route,
          but everywhere he turns MORE FIGURES APPEAR.

          He smiles, almost sweetly, disarming her. Snow White looks at
          her other captors now, noticing a blind dwarf, (MUIR), who sits
          with his son (QUERT), also gazing at her.

          Snow White and the huntsman emerge from the cave to see a

          a mirage. The air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange
          HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most
          beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts:

          gone. We searched but...
          Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out.

<b>                         MUIR

</b>          As am I, princess. As am I.
          GUS walks over to Snow White.

<b>                         GUS
</b>          I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss,
          but would you care to dance-with a little
          'un?

          Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES,
          BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at

          BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies'
          bodies, beaming at her.
          As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A
          DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall
          in alongside her.
          A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light
          crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he
          stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves.
          They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is
          the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about.
          They rise and follow to --

          on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow.
          A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading
          where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback,
          looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness.

          to his bow, peering into the gloom and listening.
          There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE. He
          spins around, ready to fire, when he sees it's only Finn's

           Ravenna sits at her desk - she is small and alone in the 
           vastness of the hall.
           She stares off into space, a quill in her hand - parchments laid
           out before her.
           Then suddenly her body convulses - the bottle of black ink 
           spills - dark tendrils of liquid seep across the papers and onto

          forest until he sees Snow White and the seven dwarves gathered
          around Gus's body, chanting a low prayer. Eric stares in

<b>                         DUKE HAMMOND
</b>          My duty is to protect the people who come
          to me for help. I will defend them with
          my last drop of blood but I will not
          abandon these walls. I cannot afford to
          believe in miracles.
          He suddenly stops as the SHOUTS outside the tent get louder.
          He goes to the flap, opens it to see --
          Snow White , still dressed in her white funeral robes, stands
           at the top of the stairs that leads down into the courtyard.
          171a EXT. COURTYARD - DUKE HAMMOND'S CASTLE 171a
          Everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath Snow
          White. Her heart pounding, she makes her way down the
          stairs. All are riveted by the sight of her, as if they're
          looking on an angel or a living miracle.
          Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he, too, is
          stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd.

<b>                         BEITH
</b>          It's a miracle!
          Duke Hammond, embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of
          her, walks up the stairs to greet her. Several Generals
          follow him but stay a few steps below them. Hammond takes
          her by the hands as they speak.

<b>                         DUKE HAMMOND
</b>          Your highness...

          looks dazed.

          is no peace while others suffer. Have you
          not learned that?

          be killed. And therefore there can be no
          victory.
          Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies:

</b>          I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the
          only one. She told me so herself.
          Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now
          her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she
          reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks...

          Like a fire hose of black shards, the Dark Faerie unloads a
          stream of razor blades at Eric.
          Eric digs his heels in... slowly grinds and slides on the
          floor, double shields up.
          The shields are being shredded. One shield gives way
          completely torn slicing Eric's arm.
          Eric has one shield left. He kneels down... it is a matter of
          seconds.

          Ravenna approaches and grabs Snow White by the throat,
          squeezing hard.
          Snow White is chocking.

          Ravenna slams Snow White down onto the stone floor next to
          the mirror altar.
          Snow White stretches for her sword as Ravenna approaches. 
          Ravenna un-sheaths her dagger.

          it is too far. She tries to drag herself a little closer... 
          still too far.
          Ravenna straddles Snow White, raises her dagger above her
          head - smiling, relishing the imminent death blow. The black
          tomb has closed in around them.
          Eric watches - despair wrought on his face -- as the knife

          her strike, reaches for her dagger and plunges it into
          Ravenna's chest, just as the huntsman taught her.
          Ravenna gasps, locks eyes with Snow White.

          Ravenna is aging at an incredible pace. Her body gives way
          and she slumps to the floor, below the mirror. 
          She looks at the mirror above her, gasping, reaching out, her 
          pale eyes looking for a friend, a miracle... but nothing. 
          The black shards that entombed the room start to shatter and 
          fall to the floor.

          William is on the ground, out of strength and has given up
          the fight. A dark creature is slowly close to reaching
          William's face with his sharp claws as William tries to hold

          shows no anger, no hate, just a strange understanding.

          Snow White, overwhelmed by compassion, places her hand on
          Ravenna's chest. Ravenna puts her own wrinkled hand on Snow
          White's.
          Ravenna smiles. She gently taps on Snow White's... in a 
          strange and affectionate motherly way.

                          
          Eric and William, exhausted and battered climb the steps of 
          the mirror chamber. It is over. 
          Ravenna stares up at Snow White's face in a shining halo of
          light above her from the ceiling.
