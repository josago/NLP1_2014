<b>1   EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT                             1
</b>
    A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards
    us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills.

    One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat
    suit stumbles.

<b>                        DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)

              Shit.

<b>                        GIRL 1 (REBECCA)
</b>              C'mon. Hurry up.

    They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the
    leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the
    bottom of the chain link fence.

    She rolls under, and the others follow.

    A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in
    unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house.

    They've done this before, they have it down.

    One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as
    they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back
    window open.

    A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as
    she climbs inside into a laundry room.

    She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they
    slip inside.
    Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area.
    She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is
    totally cool and composed.

    She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-
    brow.

<b>                        REBECCA
</b>              Let's go shopping!

    And she pulls open the closet door.

    CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags.

    A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a
    Louis Vuitton duffle bag.

     An underwear drawer is opened, and picked through.

     A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of
     prescription pills and dumps them in a bag.

     We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags.

     Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a
     mirror posing, then gets back to it.

     Vuitton bags and other loot, as much as they can carry.

     CLOSE UP: flashbulbs go off.

     Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive
     teenagers and news clips.

     We see a clip of black & white video surveillance of the
     kids' approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up.
     Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels.

     We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night.

     CLOSE UP: a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the
     hat we saw her try on earlier.

     Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags.

     T.V. image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for

     CLOSE UP: on a stack of shiny diamond necklaces.

     They pass a gilded gold-framed couch with pillows with Paris'
     photo silk screened on them.

     They pass a wall of photos of Paris Hilton and her many
     magazine covers, as they go upstairs. Marc is nervous,
     Rebecca is cool and focused.

     Rebecca picks up some small purses and finds crumpled fifties
     and hundred dollar bills that she takes.

     Rebecca casually descends the stairs as if she lives there.
     Marc follows her down, into Paris' night club room.

     There are pictures of her all over the walls, and a stripper
     pole on a little platform. Pink furry pillows line the
     banquette.

     Marc takes a bottle of vodka. Rebecca looks around the room,

     patrol car drive by, and jump in some bushes.

     The patrol car stops and flashes a light around the bushes.

     Rebecca and Marc freeze in their hiding spot. Marc is
     freaking out, he thinks this is it for him. He tries to
     breath quietly. Rebecca calmly waits.

                talk about the law of attraction
                and we want to be careful about the
                people we surround ourselves with
                because we become the average of
                those people. So we're going to
                make a visual board of people who
                are demonstrating good character,
                like Angelina Jolie. So what are
                some qualities you admire about

      Marc keeps walking, lawyers by his side, music takes over the
      sound and it becomes slow motion. Flashes go off and he makes

               believed the people were who robbed
               her house... and eventually when
