          ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who
          remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery
          reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated
          next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even
          as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and
          the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits
          peacefully; unaffected.

          He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows
          directly on him. He looks up to

<b>          THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN
</b>
          it BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING
          continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with

          Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture
          window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins
          above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls
          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in
          which he sleeps.

          HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams
          like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.
          THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes

          They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in

          Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body
          is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle
          of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the
          mirror he's been staring into.

          His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two
          dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately
          line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.

          He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself.

          Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the
          down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way
          down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the
          next level. His expression never changes.

          A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and

          swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,
          "LATE" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes
          into a black tunic and pants.
          He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over
          thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.
          The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the

          his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,
          male waiters.)
          He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of

          through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his

          his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the

<b>          INT. GOLF ROOM __ CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Everything in the room is golf. it is one man's wood paneled
          shrine to the sport of golf: golf carpet, posters,
          autographs, etc. A group of people sit around the couch
          drinking beer,. passing joints. Smoky, dark.
          Large notices JESSE, a wiry 25 year old in thick glasses.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an
          inventor yet. Anyway I developed
          this little item that's just like
          Velcro but doesn't make that
          annoying Velcro noise.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          now much did they buy it for?

<b>                         JESSE

<b>                         JESSE

          They laugh.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          Seriously.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've
          never been so bored in all my life.
          The first month I bought a whole
          bunch of shit, but then that got
          boring. But I... nothing.

</b>          That's so crazy. But I mean like,
          are you gonna travel or like what
          are you gonna do? Shouldn't you
          like help starving kids or
          something?

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          I'm not really motivated to do much
          at all. It's kind of funny, I guess
          I had kind of planned on my whole
          life being about struggling to get
          money. But now that I've got more
          than I ever dreamed, I'm really not
          sure what to do with myself. I
          stare at walls a lot.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Can you believe that shit, Large?
          This guy has one idea and he's a
          trillionaire. I got a thousand
          ideas, but I gotta sit around and
          wait for all my relatives to die.
          They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book.
          Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that
          the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty
          young; 17-19.
          As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
          GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the
          stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone
          has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Here, bro.
          He passes Large the golf book.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          Oh no thanks, man.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Really? But you're like a movie
          star and shit.

<b>                         LARGE

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Well then here. Eat this.
          Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY
          FACE on it.

<b>                         JESSE (CONT'D)

</b>          Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks
          around at everyone else in the room eating them; including
          the cute girls.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          I guess I'll see youguyslater.
          He eats the hit. They laugh.

<b>                         DANA

<b>                         DAVE

          They laugh.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          No, let's play Spin The Bottle.
          The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>
<b>                         (TO JESSE)

          importantly, how old are they?
          Jesse passes Large the joint.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          They're all legal. I think.
          He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy
          voice takes control.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          Well we just ate all this fuckin'
          ex, what the hell else are we gonna
          do?

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          The girl has a point.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Okay, how 'bout this.
          He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to
          neck.

<b>                         MARK (CONT'D}
</b>          First let's finish Daddy's golf
          tequila. Then we can use this
          bottle.
          The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA
          FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the
          beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv
          start.

<b>          THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED-

<b>          UP AND SLOW MOTION.
</b>          The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES
          TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name.

<b>                         ALL
</b>          Large!
          He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed
          directly at him.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Largeman, this is Dana.
          Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes
          with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.

<b>                         DANA
</b>          Hi.

          Oh, who's up?
          They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the
          couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in
          his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She
          stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her
          knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.
          The MUSIC PLAYS.
          Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact.
          They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.

<b>          HIS FINGERS CLUTCH HER THIGH
</b>          They stop and look at each other. She kisses him on the cheek
          and gets up. Everyone reacts and some clap.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          This is gonna be a good night.
          Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images:
          people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls
          up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off
          his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and
          Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket.
          Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him
          in his helmet.
          FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands
          gripping a waist.
          Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the
          corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile..

</b>          The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally:

<b>          BLACKNESS.
</b>          A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness. Morning sun
          streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,
          eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker
          the word "BALLS" is written.
          His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs
          swing left, then right. As Large site up
          THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are

<b>          INT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING
</b>
          Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan. White morning
          sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to
          highlight the duet in the air.
          A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea
          where he is.
          Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a
          person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his
          Bigfoot sighting.
          He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal
          box.
          Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval
          Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second
          and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the
          knight is gone.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN -- LATER
</b>
          Large and Mark sit with CAROL, mark's mother and TIN PAYTON,
          25. Carol is mid-forties and always looks like she's got a
          cold or has just been crying. Tim is dressed as a Medieval
          Knight.
          Large and mark stare at Tim as he SLURPS down his cereal.
          Carol smokes a thin cigarette. Mark is shirtless. No one
          addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On
          Large's forehead.
          Silence but for the CLANKING of SILVERWARE and TIM'S

</b>          E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad.
          So uh... he... I think he'd prefer
          me to stay on it. He likes to think
          it makes me happy. And I let him
          think that because he's sort of
          consumed by the idea of making
          everyone happy.

<b>                         DOCTOR

          give you a Catscan just so you
          won't worry that it's anything
          serious. But to be honest, I think
          the headaches are something else.
          Our bodies do very funny things
          when they're consumed with stress
          and anxiety. Things you'd never
          expect. I found my ex-best friend's
          cuff links in my wife's puree and I
          couldn't get an erection for a year
          and a half.

          really anxious at all.

<b>                         DOCTOR

          hear me right now_

</b>          Oh, right.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          First of all, I do think you need
          to find a psychiatrist that isn't
          your father. That just's something

          years ago. He knows better.

          a means to an end. But if you're

          years ago from Sally Strothers. one

          And we just couldn't. We couldn't
          sit there and not help those
          children. So we sent him letters
          and pictures for years and then I
          got really into ice skating and we
          kind of forgot about'em. Then one
          day the phone rang and it was
          Titembay and he was at the dry
          cleaners around the corner and he
          said that he was going to school at

          ignored everyone but our

          might not be the healthiest
          environment for me to be growing up

          As they turn, each one has the image of what they're watching

          lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image
          to appear in perfect focus.

          from behind by an OLDER GREASEBALL. Her face is no more than

          The three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal...

<b>          AN ENORMOUS ABANDONED QUARRY
</b>          Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the
          distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti.
          The center of the quarry goes so deep they can't see the
          bottom. They stand on the edge. Rain clouds rapidly drift
          overhead. This glace is surreal.

          Further down the path. Sam looks to Large. He uses an old mop
          handle he's found as a walking stick.
          As they continue along the path it begins to get continually
          cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub,
          remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys.
          Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY
          FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that
          sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm
          and welcoming.
          Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he
          expected. Rain begins to fall.

          They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark
          steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.

          cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats

          drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can,
          with everything they have in the POURING RAIN.

          this great memory I have where I
          was a little kid and I was crying
          for one reason or another and she
          was kind of holding me and rocking
          me back and forth. And I could see
          the little balls in this thing just
          rolling back and forth. And there
          was just snot dripping down my
          nose.

<b>                         (HE LAUGHS)

          and told me to just blow my nose
          into it. And I remember thinking,
          even as a very little kid, "Wow.
          This is love."
          More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes. He tries
