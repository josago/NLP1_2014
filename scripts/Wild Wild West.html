</b>
     A slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop.
     The CHIRP of CICADA is the only sound.

<b>     SUPERIMPOSE:   1868 - ST. TAMMANY PARISH, LOUISIANA
</b>
     But suddenly the CHIRPING GETS LOUDER and LOUDER --
     BZZZZZ! -- until we realize it's not the cicadas, but
     a --

     SWOOOSH! A lethal, razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the
     horizon, swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME!

     The CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away,
     chasing a man, THADDEUS MORTON, wearing a strange
     metallic collar -- exhausted, horrified, about to die.


<b>     NEW ANGLE - MORTON
</b>
     He looks over his shoulder, panting -- he's been running
     forever.

<b>                              MORTON
</b>                       (mumbling)
                Madman... Hideous spider... Run...
                Run! Warn the President...

     Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate
     attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. But the
     ruse is futile. The disc goes straight through the
     trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies.


<b>     NEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON
</b>
     dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field.
     Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES
     straight through the sideboards! Wood shavings spit
     everywhere! There's no stopping this thing.


<b>     NEW ANGLE - MORTON
</b>
     running for his life -- stops, turns. He turns,
     incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life,
     cowering.

<b>                                 MORTON
</b>                Noooooooo!!!!!

     A man leans INTO FRAME. This is GENERAL McGRATH.      And
     he's there to collect the silver death disc.

     HOOVES THUNDER by. Then bouncing, skidding wagon wheels.
     Up on the empty buckboard is a pair of murderous ex-Rebs.
     As the Rebs pass a pint of whisky, lash the six-horse
     team on, PAN WITH the wagon to see it's headed for...

     WEST is bathing with the beatiful SALOON GIRL.

                  should feel free to treat him
                  just bad.

     She moves in and kisses him, long and hard. West hears
     the CLATTER of the APPROACHING WAGONS. He stops the
     kiss and peeks out the knothole.

     Down below, West sees the wagon with the Rebs.

    They start kissing again. He surreptitiously peeks out
    the knothole, while continuing his kiss.


<b>6   INT. FAT-CAN CANDY'S - NIGHT                                  6
</b>
    This two-story, Victorian building across town is a
    "gentlemen's sporting house" in name only. Drunken
    roughnecks and ex-Confederate soldiers goose and maul
    the rouged-up tarts.

<b>    AT BAR - WOMAN
</b>
    shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry. The Toulouse
    Lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and
    makeup, identifying her as a SOILED DOVE. A whore -- not
    to put too fine a point on it. She's trying not to make
    eye contact with two men seated at a table across the
    parlor.


    SOILED DOVE'S POV - GEN. McGRATH AND HUDSON

    HUDSON is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored
    suit. Long black braids descend incongruously from under
    a homburg hat. As for his companion...

    McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus. Six foot, sweating
    like a Devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized
    Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top.
    His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to
    be a miniature leather Victrola horn. McGrath smiles at
    our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture.

    Eyes widened in revulsion. What evil abides in this
    Godforsaken place? Now a drunkenly EYE-CROSSED REB
    licks Dora's ear, then whispers something in it.
    Something unspeakably vile, by Dora's expression.

<b>                              DORA
</b>                 I'm sorry. That won't be
                 possible. I have... tonsillitis.


<b>7   EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT         7

    The Rebs load the boxes onto the wagon. We see the wheel
    of the wagon up against the rotted leg of the water
    tower.

<b>                               BIG REB

    West is unaware that she's watching him, not watching
    her.

<b>                               SALOON GIRL
</b>                        (admonishing)

<b>                               WEST
</b>                 Ah, this hole is a safety issue.
                 I'm thinking, what if it starts to
                 rain and the water level goes up.
                 It could suck you right up. I'm
                 protecting you. (variations)

    Saloon Girl frustrated, has grabbed West's boxer shorts
    (with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with
    them.

<b>                               SALOON GIRL
</b>                 Problem solved.

<b>                               WEST
</b>                 Belle, you don't just ram a man's
                 underbritches into a knothole.
                 You wanna plug the hole, you ram
                 your own britches in there.

    West is at a loss.    She moves in for another kiss.

               for that you might need to hand
               me my gun...

     The tower starts to topple.

<b>                             WEST
</b>               ... Hand me my gun.

     It CRASHES...

     West crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes. The
     only people more shocked than he is are the guards and
     the Rebs he just dropped in on. West picks himself up,
     smiles coolly at the drenched slack-jaws.

<b>                             WEST
</b>               Okay, who just made a wish?
               Was it you?

     He looks up at the freaked-out Saloon Girl, still in the
     tank. She hangs on with one hand, the other hand
     clutches his clothes.

<b>                             WEST
</b>               I could sure use those clothes
               now.

     She responds by Frisbee-ing his hat down. West picks it
     up, with a look... uses it to cover his genitals.

     But he never gets that word out. Bang! West lashes a

                  remember?

     As the other Reb comes at him, he spins, still holding
     the hat in front of him... and whap! Down that one goes.
     West looks up at the none-too-bright water tank woman.

     General McGrath checks a pocket watch, looks up
     impatiently at the Indian, Hudson. His eyes drift
     upwards... to the balcony where...


<b>     ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS

     have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk.

                             McGRATH
               I'm still waiting on my guns and
               ammo, but I see my men have
               brought your merchandise.

     McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for
     Hudson to confirm. Hudson nods.

                             McGRATH
               I had expected to be delivering it
               personally to Mr...

     Hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name.
     The Indian speaks in a very precise King's English.

     MOVE IN ON an elegant brougham driven by a very large,
     very striking woman in livery.

     As the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make
     out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's "employer,"
     DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. Clustered around him inside the cab
     are three more beautiful women. As he strokes the cheek
     of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a
     cat...

                  Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't
                  planning to walk those oaken
                  stairs with you. Direct me to the
                  poot, sir. Something young and
                  creamy. A gamer that takes to the
                  crop and spur.

     McGrath looks to the singer (Rita), who beats a hasty
     retreat from him after her song. So, once again, McGrath
     lays his rheumy eyes on...


<b>     ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE

     She's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the
     balcony with the trunk. As she starts for the stairs...
     a man's hand grabs her. It's the Eye-Crossed Reb again.

     She tries to pull away.    But the Reb won't let go.

<b>                                EYE-CROSSED REB
</b>                  But you gotta be interested.
                  You're a whore.

     Suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage.
     The falsetto becomes a baritone growl.

                  That doesn't mean a girl can't
                  have high standards.

     Just as the Reb registers the odd new voice... wham!    Her

     As he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at
     him with a knife. West hops up on one leg, smacks the
     guy with a mule kick.

     Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. When the
     hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist --
     which coldcocks the other guard.

     quiet. As the Reb crumples, McGrath turns back to
     Gordon/Dora, oddly inspired.

     but it's no use. He quickly climbs over the boxes, onto
     the buckboard seat. But the reins are dragging on the
     ground beneath the frothing horses.

     West leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the
     street. He pulls himself over the first one's neck...
     onto the next horse. And as he tries for the lead horse,
     he falls between them!

     Gordon jerks West's gun hand away from McGrath's head
     just as the dog-soldier comes around. McGrath suddenly
     lunges at him.

                                McGRATH
                         (bellows ferociously)

     He drives his full weight into Jim's back, pushing him out
     into...

     McGrath's rebel yell brings help from all directions.
     DOORS BANG open all along the hallway. Not just
     McGrath's men, but Hudson and his crew. A melee will
     ensue.

     West pushes the monster off of him, rolls as a BULLET
     SPLINTERS the WOOD where he just was. The SHOT STARTS...


<b>     ANGLE - STAMPEDE OF SEMI-CLAD WHORES
</b>
     all screaming hysterically and heading for the exits.
     The beautiful young singer, who'd been coming up the
     stairs alone, is now swept back down them.

     Gordon, still in character, pushes his way upstream to the
     room where the scientist is held.

     Hudson whirls to see the gruff-talking Gordon/Dora holding
     the perfume bottle on him like it's a Colt 45. Now Gordon
     shakes one of the heavy bracelets off his wrist, CLICKS a
     LOCK, snapping it open. He's accessorized with custom
     handcuffs.

<b>                                GORDON

     Hudson gives a sick little smile, reaches for his gun
     when... WSSSSHT!

     Gordon sprays him in the eyes with the second bulb of the
     atomizer. (The first Mace!) Hudson howls in pain, drops
     the gun, rubs his eyes madly with both hands.

<b>                                  GORDON

     presented wrists when...

     brawling a dozen attackers. West spots McGrath trying to
     escape down the stairs. He uncorks a lethal kick, sending
     a thug flying through the doorway and into the back of
     Gordon.

     Gordon staggers, drops the perfume/mace BOTTLE which
     SHATTERS. Hudson recovers his vision enough to send a
     fist into Gordon's mascaraed face, pile-driving him back
     into the hall. While Hudson and his men make their
     escape down the back stairs with the scientist sack...

     West is blocked from chasing McGrath, Gordon from going
     after Hudson. West tries to push her aside.

     to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom

                  The fact is, gentlemen, you've
                  both been working on the same
                  case all along. Why did it take
                  you so long to realize it?

<b>                                WEST
</b>                  Well, sir, one of us was still
                  trying to figure out if he was a
                  man or a woman.

     The detectives snicker over that one.    Grant's had
     enough.

     An aide presents a glass case.     Inside is a cake in the
     shape of the White House.

                  McGrath may be a vicious killer,
                  but a mastermind he is not. So
                  whom do we seek? After consulting

                  McGrath's headed for New Orleans.
                  The longer we stand here talkin',
                  the farther away he gets. I don't
                  need 'Intelligence' to tell me
                  that.

                  railroads will be joined at
                  Promontory Point.

     Grant points to a map of the United States. The railroad
     lines have been drawn in... still a gap between them.

                  You have a week. Dismissed!

     They both return Grant's salute as the President stomps
     off. His AIDE now approaches.

                  Mr. Gordon, the item you
                  requested.

     Gordon takes the box, hurries to catch up with West.

     West and Gordon, walking toward the hitching post. West
     is so beside himself he can barely untie his high-voltage
     stud. He glowers at Gordon who goes over to where...

     Is parked on the other side of a bush. It has the
     customary big wheel in the front, little wheel in the
     back. (Hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire.
     Dual manifolds that sling under the rider's legs.)

     West shakes his head in disgust.

</b>                  Save it.   I've gotta train to
                  catch.

     West swings into the saddle. He looks at the SNORTING
     wild HORSE under him, then down at Gordon attaching the
     box onto the seat of his Nitro-whatever.

<b>                                WEST

                          salute)
                  Yee-haaa!!

     West spurs his horse and leaves Gordon in the proverbial
     cloud of dust.

     Although West's intentions are clear, for some reason,
     Gordon's in no particular hurry. He sighs, climbs on the
     bike, takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles.
     Then, finally ready...

<b>                                 GORDON
</b>                  Avant!!!

     VROOOM! An ENGINE KICKS IN and Gordon rockets forward.
     (Yep, Artemus has invented the first motorcycle!) Fiery
     exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels
     him down the street at about 60 mph right past...


<b>     ANGLE ON WEST AND HIS STALLION
</b>
     who both look over in wide-eyed shock. The horse rears
     as Gordon SCREAMS by -- leaving them in a cloud of
     internal combustion.

     From in front, as it CHUGS TOWARDS us. Sitting up in the
     spanking new steam engine (No. 5) is a white-haired
     Coleman. The Wanderer is his pride and joy. Coleman
     pushes the throttle forward and the ENGINE ROARS PAST
     us... followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger
     cars.

     Then comes West THUNDERING past in a desperate effort to
     catch up.

     riding like hell. Getting the last ounce of speed out of
     his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the
     rear passenger car. He looks up... In the window, we see
     Gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to
     be sewing.

<b>                                WEST
</b>                  Stop this train!! You hear me!?!

     If Gordon hears him, he pretends not to.    He just
     casually makes the next stitch.

     West's horse has had it. They're losing ground to the
     train. At the last second, West leans over at full
     gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. He
     swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life,
     blowing in the breeze like laundry.

     Finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its
     weight on. Just as West stands safely on it... whoosh!
     He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding
     partition in the roof.

     The car is like a classy Victorian men's club. Bar
     stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative
     pistols on the wall, books, etc. Gordon, seated in a
     club chair, looks over as West falls from the ceiling
     into a seat. He's hot, dusty and very pissed off. He
     glowers at Gordon murderously.

<b>                                GORDON

                  this like men!

     He takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves.
     Gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing.

<b>                                GORDON

<b>                                GORDON
</b>                  Right now, I'm putting the final
                  touches on a new invention of my
                  creation. I call it... The
                  Impermeable. It's a vest that,
                  when worn under the clothing, can
                  stop any modern bullet fired even
                  at close range.

     West draws his gun, aims it at Gordon's stomach and cocks
     the trigger.

<b>                                 WEST
</b>                  Really?

     Gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach.

<b>                                GORDON
</b>                  But it hasn't been really

<b>                                 WEST
</b>                  Get up!

     West takes off his guns and puts them on the table.

<b>                                GORDON
</b>                         (yawn, yawn)
                  Guns. I find them so primitive
                  and unnecessary... if one has done
                  one's proper planning.

<b>                                 WEST
</b>                  Yeah?   How do you feel about a
                  fist?

     Gordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary
     sigh.

<b>                                GORDON
</b>                  I must tell you, Mr. West, I've
                  always felt that allowing a
                  situation to degenerate into
                  physical violence is a failure on
                  my part.

<b>                                WEST
</b>                  Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you
                  failed.

     Whap! West unleashes a lightning punch that drives
     Gordon across the train car. He dabs at his bloody lip.

                  this on yourself.

     Then to West's utter amazement, Gordon puts his hands
     together as if praying while at the same time, crooking
     his right leg stork-like. Is this some kind of martial
     art? Then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet
     dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a
     switch.

     It immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down
     from the ceiling. It whacks West on the side of the
     head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table.

     shakes it off and is about to attack again. Gordon
     calmly pokes a hidden button. Suddenly the pool table
     revolves. West is gone.

                  clue there...

     Excited, Gordon turns on the lantern attached to the back

     Suddenly, Gordon shoots the cuffs off his jacket. Out of
     one sleeve comes a pen. Out the other, a small pad of
     paper. They are both connected to a spring-loaded metal
     gizmo up his sleeve. West reacts, drawing his pistol up
     into Gordon's face.

     Jim West drops to the ground from where he'd hitched a
     ride underneath. He rolls into the shadows of the house.
     When he stands, he's face to face with a huge GUARD with
     a gun.

     He withdraws his hand. While the Guard squints at his
     empty palm, West grabs his head with his other hand and
     smacks it into the lawn jockey's fist... clang! West

     Now Miss Lippenreider, Amazonia and Munitia (bewigged and
     wearing costumes) wrangle a beautiful and defiant Latina
     into the room. When she turns we recognize she's the
     singer from Fat-Can's. Rita is in her early 20s, wearing
     a 19th-Century camisole so scanty, it makes it hard to
     concentrate on what she's saying.

     goes to the balcony.

     The scene below is hallucinogenically surreal. A Babel
     of foreign languages is the first thing that strikes us.
     Avant garde MUSIC is coming from two 10x10 quartet boxes
     on either side of the room to create stereo.

     She's got the mole, too.    Gordon has apparently encored

     It stops with a CLUNK. Suddenly...

     bursts open and Abraham Lincoln in a mini-float appears.
     It's decked out like Lincoln's box at Ford's theater. On
     its own power, it moves past the laughing party-goers in

     He ducks behind a mountain man carrying the French
     tricolor. When Loveless and General McGrath disappear
     into the study and close the door, West eases after
     them. He pauses as he passes the "Soiled Dove," leans
     into her big bouffant. He regards a stained-glass window

                  doesn't drop down your pretty
                  dress.

     As the Soiled Dove jumps a little, West continues over to
     the study door. Now the Soiled Dove turns, and we see
     the scared/confused expression. Maybe it's because she
     is not Artemus.

     He's the mountain man in the fringe jacket. And right
     now he's shaking his head as he watches West resort to a
     decidedly low-tech surveillance method of Loveless's
     study.

     McGrath paces in front of Loveless's desk.

                                McGRATH
                  Dr. Loveless, my men are ready to
                  go to war with no weapons to
                  fight. Ever since the nitro and
                  the guns were destroyed at Fat-
                  Can's, lice and demoralization
                  have set in!

                  will be part of the greatest
                  military victory of this century!

     McGrath's face relaxes into a pyorrheic grin.

                                McGRATH
                  Oh, you're a pip, sir! I'd follow
                  you into the maw of Cerberus
                  himself!

     Loveless takes pencil in hand and draws a map on the
     desk.

     behind him folding up the map...

     ducks out of the way as Loveless and McGrath emerge from
     the study. As they disappear into the throng of well-
     wishers, West takes a thin lock-pick out of his hat band.
     It takes him a moment or two, but the LOCK finally
     CLICKS. Then West slips inside, apparently undetected --
     except by an unimpressed Gordon.

     moves quickly to the desk past walls filled with oil
     portraits of various Loveless relatives. The one behind
     the desk is in the style of Gainsborough. A Loveless
     uncle is standing on a windswept grouse moor, two English
     setters by his side, a Holland and Holland double held in
     the crook of his arm.

     West turns his attention to the desk blotter. There's a
     faint imprint where Loveless drew the map. West takes
     his penknife and a pencil -- grates some graphite into
     the depressions. He's just about to do a rubbing on a
     piece of paper when... someone swipes it out of his hand.

     Hands on hips, she gives him a "naughty, naughty" look.

                  never been much good at French.

     But instead of scolding him further, Miss East plants an
     over-heated kiss on him. Tongues are involved. As they
     break, she gives a little nod of approval.

     once...

     crowd chit-chatting with this person and that (in
     French, Spanish, German) when he sees something of
     interest.

     Munitia and Lippenreider come out of an upstairs bedroom,
     lock it behind them. Hmmm. What's in there? As he
     starts upstairs, Amazonia appears, blocking his way.

     Amazonia stares at him, then spiels off a couple lines
     in a foreign language that makes Gordon's eyes widen.
     He understands what she said and it's not flattering.
     Gordon moves off in a shock.

     are locked in a passionate embrace. West manages to
     position her nearly-naked rear end over the graphite
     powder. Very carefully, he stands, pushing her buttocks
     onto the desk and then rolling her off. The imprint on
     her left cheek is perfect. But unfortunately, it's
     backwards!

     raises her ass up into position so he can see the

     pointing it at the back of West's head.

     suddenly contorts his upper torso just as an EXPLOSION
     rips the back of the chair where his head would have

     He draws and SHOOTS the would-be assassin, who falls out
     of the painting, dead. West turns to see...

     A surprised look on her face. A hole in her forehead.
     He lowers her head gently to the ground, regards her

     way through the dance floor and spots the Soiled Dove
     look-alike out on the floor. West reluctantly

     of foreigners out a side exit.

                  So you enjoy the party. I'm gonna
                  go save the Republic.

     The Soiled Dove look-alike is speechless.    Before he
     goes, West leans in, smirks.

<b>                                WEST

                  perky.

     And just to dig the grave deeper, West lays hands on them
     and gives them a little squeeze. This immediately
     elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the
     bejesus out of the black cowboy. And he's not the only
     one.

     And with that, Gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal
     his own rope, which he throws to the mob. West looks
     back at the character in amazement. That's Gordon?!
     Before West can say or do anything, guns are at his
     temple, and he's swept out of the room.

     Gordon calmly straightens his coonskin cap, seemingly
     uninterested in West's imminent hanging. In the hubbub
     of everyone rushing out for the hanging, Gordon heads up
     the unguarded stairs to the locked room.

     As he pulls out his high tech auto-wind lock-pick and
     quickly gains entrance to the door...

     Gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe. It becomes a pedal
     that operates the wheels' rotation. Now he removes a bit
     and handle from his vest and attaches the cable. Starts
     to pump his foot. It's a foot-powered drill.

                  series of major misunderstandings
                  and I'd like to take a moment to
                  clear them up. First, the whole
                  drumming on the boobies thing.
                  In my native land, Africa, my
                  ancestors used drums to
                  communicate between villages. I'm
                  sure y'all can see that this young
                  girl here can communicate all the
                  way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on
                  a clear day, we might even get
                  Galveston. All I was saying was,
                  'How're you doing,' 'My name's Jim,'
                  'How's your mama?'

                  sense that some of you took that
                  negatively. You know, some of my

                  and pick your own damn cotton.

     Nostrils flared and wild-eyed, are having their rumps

                  I'll send him back safely...

     And with that... West suddenly leaps over Rita -- lands
     on the back of one of the horses. He grabs a handful of
     mane, leans over and unclips the harness. And with a
     kick in the ribs, West is off at a gallop -- leaving
     Gordon, one remaining horse and an awed Rita behind to
     chew his dust.

     Dr. Loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are
     sipping champagne. One of them is holding a little DOG
     in his arms, BARKING at something in the dark. General
     McGrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically
     pensive. Loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of
     champagne.

     A reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down
     to marsh. Beyond that is the Gulf of Mexico. We
     recognize one of the REBS from the cathouse. He opens
     his pocket watch.

     Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from
     the marsh. They ready their arms and get in defensive
     positions. What they can't see through the fog is...

     Unbeknownst to the Rebs, Loveless has mowed and stained
     the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart
     board appearance.

<b>                                LOVELESS
</b>                  After you... sir.

     BOOOM!!! McGrath has a very startled expression as he
     looks down at the aftereffects of DOUBLE-OUGHT BUCKSHOT.
     As he crumples to the deck, Loveless sniffs.

<b>                                LOVELESS
</b>                  Bloodbath McGrath indeed.

     The dignitary's DOG starts BARKING, jumps to the deck.
     It sits next to the fallen General's gramophone ear and
     cocks his head. With the RCA logo invented we MOVE BACK

     He sighs at his pale guests. They don't seem to
     appreciate the efficiency of his slaughter.

<b>                                LOVELESS
</b>                  Well, that concludes the
                  festivities. Ladies, feed him to
                  the crabs.

     Munitia and Amazonia unceremoniously dump McGrath's BODY
     overboard. SPLOOSH... Loveless addresses the
     dignitaries...

<b>                                LOVELESS
</b>                  But, my friends, that tank is just
                  a little ol' toy compared to what
                  this country's greatest scientists
                  are cooking up for me next. So if
                  I've piqued your interest, bring
                  1000 kilograms of your country's
                  gold to Spider Canyon four days
                  from now.
                         (starts to roll
                          off boat)
                  Now if you'll excuse me, I've got
                  a tank to catch.

     A black waits ominously on the tracks. It's less a
     traditional train car than a riveted, armored, turreted fortress
     on wheels. Also, it currently lacks an engine.

     Loveless, over his shoulder to the foreign contingent...

</b>                  My destination is both the
                  future... and the past! Forget
                  Paul Revere, this will be the most
                  revolutionary ride in the history
                  of America!!

     He looks dotingly at the TANK, which CLATTERS up from the
     battlefield on its treads... then drives onto the tracks.
     Wheels drop down out of the chassis, the treads retract
     up, and the TANK BACKS INTO the rest of the TRAIN.
     CLANK. It's a neat modular fit. Black death on rails.

     The foreigners watch with awe as...

     wheels up onto the tank/train. He drops the
     expansiveness, fixes them with a viper's eye.

<b>                                LOVELESS
</b>                  If you don't want to miss the

                  1000 kilograms of your country's
                  gold in my hands no later than
                  Friday. That's when I make our
                  little proposal to President
                  Grant. One I'm ever so confident
                  he's gonna accept.

     Now a rider ENTERS FRAME...

     West slowly dismounts, transfixed by the slaughter on the
     pre-fab battlefield. There's something hauntingly familiar
     about all this for him -- the mangled bodies, the tread marks...
     But we'll find out about that later.

     West draws his weapon and begins walking through the
     victims. The pace of his search quickens when he isn't
     finding what he's looking for -- General McGrath.

<b>     NEW ANGLE - GORDON AND RITA
</b>
     have arrived in the one-horse carriage. Gordon is trying
     to recreate the crime scene. Rita trails behind him, his
     coat thrown over her shoulders, trying not to gag as she
     passes the mangled corpses.

<b>                                GORDON
</b>                  It came up out of the lake...
                  from the way these corpses are
                  positioned, laid down a 360-degree
                  pattern of cannon fire... then
                  disappeared in moments.
                         (puts a foot on a body,
                          scratches his chin)
                  My God, what kind of weapon is it?

     Rita can't handle Gordon's clinical posturing.

<b>                                RITA
</b>                  Excuse me, I think I'm going to be
                  sick.

     As she walks quickly away, West comes over, a haunted
     look on his face.

<b>                                WEST
</b>                  It just rolls on and on. Makes a
                  screeching sound -- like a wounded
                  animal. Got a 'cabin' on top with
                  a cannon... swivels 'round like an
                  eagle's head.

<b>                                GORDON

<b>                                WEST
</b>                  Heard about it. Thought it was
                  crazy survivors' stories.

<b>                                GORDON
</b>                  What survivors? There aren't any
                  here.

</b>                  New Liberty, Illinois -- the free

                  Just one week before the War ended
                  in '65. I was in the 9th Cavalry
                  that discovered it. Old men,
                  women, children... they used them
                  for target practice...

     He looks out at the battlefield as if reliving it.
     Gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain -- just shuts
     up. West's grim reverie is interrupted by MOANING coming
     from the shoreline. They all follow the sound to find...


<b>76   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - MARSH - NIGHT                          76
</b>
     General McGrath, washed up on the shore. West looks down
     at him. Now Rita, still looking green around the gills,
     rejoins the party.

<b>                                WEST
</b>                  That's when I vowed to follow
                  McGrath to the end of the earth.

     As grey as four-day-old mullet, McGrath manages a smile
     for his relentless pursuer.

                                McGRATH
                         (barely audible)
                  What's the matter, West? Thought
                  you'd be happy to find me... like
                  this.

<b>                                WEST
</b>                  I was hoping to kill you myself.

<b>                                RITA
</b>                  That's a nice way to talk to
                  people.

                                McGRATH
                  You'll have to live with it... As
                  I've lived with the blame for New
                  Liberty.

     McGrath fades out.    West grabs him and shakes him.

<b>                                WEST
</b>                  What do you mean?

                                McGRATH
                         (opens eyes)
                  It was Loveless... his plan. He
                  operated the killing machine
                  there. Smarter now... left it to
                  others here.

     With the meaning of it all sinking in, West grabs McGrath
     by the collar and pulls him toward him.

<b>                                 WEST

     The General tries to speak. West puts his ear to the
     General's mouth. But before he can say it, McGrath
     closes his eyes for the last time.

     West's shoulders sag.    Then from behind...

<b>                                RITA (O.S.)

     West and Gordon burst in, surprising Coleman, who's got
     his feet up, perusing the Playboy of the day -- a mail

     West snatches the catalogue out of his hands, does a take
     at the pictures of chunky models in bloomers.

     West has every weapon on the train out for cleaning and

                  without any reproductive organs
                  could possibly want with Rita.

     Suddenly there's a WHOOSH and Rita falls through the
     ceiling and plops in the chair just like West did
     earlier. He instinctively pulls his gun. Puts it
     away as Gordon muses about her anatomy.

                  figure that would inspire a
                  Botticelli... or a Raphael.

     Rita raises an eyebrow, looks to the galley as Gordon
     comes out with a platter of food. He still doesn't
     see her there.

<b>                                GORDON

                    Oh, but I do.

       Gordon grabs a rock and smashes West's collar.
       Suddenly --

       ZIIIINNG! West's collar emits a LOW HUM. Suddenly,
       West is thrown into Gordon, their collars locking.
<b>       CLANG!

<b>                                  GORDON

                           (he's had enough)
                    That's it --

       West lifts his leg to Gordon's collar to push him
       away, but then -- CLANG! The stiletto in his shoe
       dislodges and instantly sticks to Gordon's magnetic
       collar.

       For a mega-millisecond, West -- his foot stuck to his
       partner's neck -- is stunned. But before he knows what
       even happened, West flips upside down onto his shoulders.

<b>                                  GORDON

                    my boot off!

       First, Gordon -- trying to get some leverage -- puts his
       foot in West's crotch and pulls the boot.

<b>                                   WEST

</b>                    Apologies, apologies.

       Gordon struggles to free the writhing West from the boot
       (attached to Gordon's collar).

       Finally, West's foot comes free. But when he sits up
       -- THWAP! His collar is sucked into Gordon's belt buckle.
       West is face to face with his partner's crotch.

<b>                                  WEST

       The men run in opposite directions. (Gordon's belt on
       West's collar, West's boot on Gordon's). They get about
       thirty, forty yards. Then --

       They're yanked backwards into each other.

       SPLASH! They fall in the water -- back to back. Every
       time one rolls up and catches his breath, the other is
       under water.

       Finally they roll out of the stream and onto dry land.
       They sit up, out of breath, stuck together, back to back.

      West eats the grilled Gila monster voraciously. And
      eats. And enjoys it more. And eats. He notices Gordon

                   comedy -- at Ford's Theater in
                   Washington. There was this one
                   line I had... always got the
                   biggest laugh in the show. One
                   night, it drowned out the

      He's on his back, arm holding the metal doughnut
      straight out over his head, being dragged across the
      desert floor by some unseen force.

      Gordon snowplows backwards through the sand for 40 feet,
      finally coming to an abrupt stop with a metallic klang!

      West deadpans this bit of insanity, walks over, and with
      the toe of his boot, uncovers the explanation -- iron

      A natural bowl that appears to have been made by a
      meteor, is gouged out of the desert floor. In the bowl
      are several spectacular Victorian-style buildings made
      almost entirely of glass, plus a huge silo. Ant-sized

      Now they hear a strange sound. To modern ears, a WHINE
      as from a jet engine. Loveless appears in the f.g. He's
      rising on a steel platform as if on some unseen elevator.
      Up, up, up he goes... as now more of the contraption comes
      INTO VIEW. Alloy girders, multi-levels, control boards...
      all open in an Eiffel Tower-like effect.

      West and Gordon scramble for cover behind a rock as a
      giant metal Tarantula steps over the rim in full
      terrifying glory. Eight legs, five stories high.

      The thorax of the giant spider bristles with Gatling guns
      and all manner of weaponry. As the shadow of the monster
      passes over their faces...

      There's a hush in the crowd. Loveless, a red handprint
      on his face, is a little nonplussed. Amazonia moves in
      threateningly, but Loveless stops her, starts to laugh.

                   Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to
                   me?

      Ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet. But she
      probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost
      aches" in certain amputated places.

      waiting to be executed.    Something's not quite kosher
      about her for Gordon.

      Now with the crowd singing along, she pulls out all the
      stops. Her gestures and dance moves become more
      exaggerated, she's in the thrall of her audience.

                     preachers.'

      She sashays over to the French dignitary, pulls his
      monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it,
      steaming it up. As she pops it back on his face...

                   'Heads thrown back to show their

      Now she puts her cheek next to Rita as if matching their
      relative beauty while picking the pocket of Lippenreider.

      Rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before Ebonia
      hands Coleman the keys to the cuffs. Coleman looks from
      the keys to Ebonia. He just caught on.

      Then Ebonia prances on stage to Gordon, cuddles up to
      him. Gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with
      a mixture of amusement and relief. Of course, it's his
      "I'd rather be dead" partner, Jim West.

      West/Ebonia wraps the feather boa around Gordon's neck --
      hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand. Gordon looks
      worried. What's he going to do with a gun? As he tucks

      An immediate standing ovation. The diversion allows
      Coleman to unlock both Grant's and Rita's shackles.
      Grant looks at the keys.

      Immediately two FLAME THROWERS EXPLODE from his cone-like
      bosoms.

      Maybe he should've listened about the dress. He turns to
      Gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of
      Loveless's goons. He howls in pain, runs panicked...
      right into Rita.

      As she relieves the charred goon of his keys... Loveless
      turns to the rest of his goons.

                   Him! Him! The girl!

      Finally getting it, they rush Ebonia. Even his 4th of
      July breasts aren't a match for them. Desperate, West
      reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of
      Gordon's billiard balls. He depresses the number and
      rolls it at the guards.

      KA-BOOOOM! An EXPLOSION rips the place and a Santa Ana-
      sized fire starts immediately.

      Rita jumps up and makes her way through the smoke to a
      bearded SCIENTIST.

      three goons charge them. Coleman, amazed at their
      torpor, quickly grabs a RIFLE from the incinerated goon
      and OPENS FIRE. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

      Three goons drop. Gordon and West exchange looks.
      Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer.

      Speaking of the President... he's grabbed a dead goon's
      RIFLE, and is LAYING DOWN a pretty good field of FIRE
      himself. Suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from
      behind. It's Amazonia. Whap, she sends a right to his
      chin knocking him out. She throws him over her shoulder
      and carries him away.

      As fire engulfs the place, Loveless has no choice but to
      retreat... for now. Surrounded by a cadre of his women,

      through a round STEEL VAULT DOOR. As Amazonia swings the

      PANNING an expanse of canvas comprising a 20-foot wing
      span. In the b.g., we hear Gordon SCRIBBLING.

</b>                Now Bernoulli's Principle states
                that the air flowing over a bird's

                pressure than the pressure below
                the wing... that's called 'lift.'
                Course, it's just a theory... it's
                never been tested.


<b>      NEW ANGLE - GORDON'S DRAWING

      It depicts a wing cutting through the air. Arrows
      indicating airflow. Circular lines indicating "life."
      Only one problem, it's upside down. Gordon remedies
      that. Looks sheepishly to West who, like him, is wearing
      a leather flight jacket and goggles.

</b>                You're not makin' me feel any

      Now they attach the wing to the frame -- which is
      connected to the Nitro-cycle.

      Coleman, his ever-present cigarette dangling from his
      mouth, readies bombs from the gunpowder of cartridges and
      Gordon's design. They look like Flash Gordon's
      spaceship. He passes them out.

      Gordon grabs them away from him and sits in the saddle of
      the Nitro-cycle. West looks at Coleman apologetically as
      he stuffs the bombs into his jacket.

<b>                              WEST

      they BLAST OUT OF FRAME.

      West gives him an encouraging pat.

<b>                              WEST

      But their speed is not enough to get them airborne.

<b>                              GORDON
</b>                We're not getting enough lift!
                We need more speed!

      Then in an uncharacteristic move by Gordon, he turns the
      machine around and heads for the cliff.

</b>                Yes, I do know.

      And with that, the Nitro-cycle goes off the cliff! It
      disappears for the count of five. Then suddenly it
      swoops up and PAST CAMERA. They're flying!

</b>                Mr. President, I'll ask you once

      Loveless's face darkens as Amazonia hands him a tray of
      cotton balls.

                smithereens, ruins the ear for
                music. Don't you?

      He offers them to the President.    Grant swats them away.

      And with that the Tarantula OPENS FIRE on the town.
      There's a lot of stomping and smashing, too.

      thrusting. Steam, billowing. Struggles to his feet.

      There, out of the shadows, steps...

      He's a mess... no hands, just brass collars where they

      shoots out from where his left hand used to be.

      West reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in
      his boot. Knife Guy responds by producing another
      blade from his other cuff.

<b>                                 WEST

                   see if he can...

      No time for talk. Knife Guy does a bad-ass series of
      moves. The blades criss-crossing one another at blinding
      speed. West, unimpressed, retorts with a lame shake of
      his stiletto and boot.

      And the fight begins...

      Knife Guy attacks! West narrowly escapes each thrust of
      the knife, and attempts a kick to the groin... but comes
      up short -- The stiletto collides with one of the blades
      and snaps like a carrot. His only weapon... gone.

<b>                                  WEST

      West rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack. Sparks
      fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but
      misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead.

      West rolls to the floor, sucking air. Knife Guy lands
      a kick to West's ribs. And to make matters worse...

<b>      WRENCH GUY
</b>
      just showed up. He swings his wrench at West's head.
      West ducks but gets kicked in the back. He sails across
      the room, lands flat on his back. Now...

<b>      SHOVEL GUY
</b>
      makes an appearance. He hammers his shovel at West's
      groin, over and over. (West is in a crab position and
      backs up to avoid this.) West finally gets a kick in
      -- it does a moderate amount of damage.

      Wrench Guy appears and swings his huge wrench at West's
      head. West escapes it, barely...

      Knife Guy thrusts a side-kick at West's chest, but West
      catches his foot, holds on for dear life.

      Wrench Guy is inbound, with wrench in hand. He swings
      on West, but West blocks it with Knife Guy's leg... OUCH!
      West punches both of them. Wrench Guy tumbles OUT OF
<b>      FRAME.
</b>
      West stands. Looking for a way out, but... no luck...
      Shovel Guy attacks. West ducks and the shovel connects
      squarely with Knife Guy's blades. West crouches and
      throws two simultaneous punches, each connecting with a
      set of jewels.

      West stands, follows it up with a right cross and left
      hook and these two jokers wind up OUT OF FRAME.

      Now... the Wrench Guy is on his feet and he's pissed!
      He attacks West, lands a solid kick to the chest and
      West flies backward toward a...


<b>      HANGING CHAIN
</b>
      which he grabs. He scales the gears, gets a solid grip,
      then swings, a huge arc across the room, gaining momentum,
      and kicks Shovel Guy and Wrench Guy at the same time! Off
      their feet they go, slamming onto the metal floor.

      West lands. Knife Guy attacks. West uses the chain to
      block the blades which are flying at him, left and right.
      Sparks fly. West manages to wrap the chain around one of
      the knives, locks it down, and heaves it into the gears...
      the blade snaps.

<b>                                 WEST

      West drops a stiff right-cross on the chin of the Knife
      Guy... wobbles his legs a bit. But before West can follow
      up...

<b>      ANOTHER BLADE SHOOTS OUT
</b>
      to replace the broken one.    It stops about a half-an-inch
      from West's nose.

      A struggle ensues, but West manages to wrap the chain
      around Knife Guy's neck and string him up.

      West throws a kick to his back... Knife Guy, hanging by
      his neck, flies through the belly... (the chain is on a
      track)... and out of the mouth of the beast, down into
      the abyss, chain and all.

      Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West. West
      grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession...

      Wrench Guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the
      action. But West uses the shovel to deflect the swing-
      ing wrench... sparks fly.

      West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks
      Shovel Guy OUT OF FRAME. West spins just in time to
      land a crippling blow to Wrench Guy's back.

      Shovel Guy grabs the shovel. He and West tug-o'-war again.
      West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with
      him. West elbows him in the ribs. He responds by putting
      West in a choke hold. West swings the shovel wildly but
      hits his target -- shovel Guy's head!

      West steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure,
      whacks him in the back.

      Wrench Guy attacks. West defends himself with the shovel
      and lands a stiff kick to his stomach. Wrench Guy goes
      down...

      West turns, hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel
      and he goes down...

      Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at
      his head. West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks
      the deadly blow at the last second.

      West has now found his rhythm...

      He swings and shovel and connects with... first, the
      foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head --
      BOINK! West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling
      Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the
      space between the gears. We won't see him anymore!

      West pivots and WHACK!... Shovel Guy plants a neat
      little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw. West
      backs up and catches another in the stomach. Then...

      Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of...

      He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan-

      West, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which
      flips into his hand and -- WHACK! -- lands a clean one
      right on the top of Shovel Guy's melon.

      Shovel Guy reels back and tumbles over the railing,
      through the hole and he's gone...

<b>                                 WEST
</b>                   Don't forget your shovel!

                   Is that all you got for me,
                   Loveless?!

      West, exhausted, turns and sees...

<b>      METAL HEAD
</b>
      all seven feet of him. The top of his head is a metal
      plate. Extending downward, encircling his eyes. West
      soaks him in, sighs.

<b>                                 WEST
</b>                   Uh, I just threw my shovel out.
                   So this really isn't fair. If
                   you don't mind, I'd like to...

      West, at lightning speed, throws a sucker-punch/spin-
      ning back-fist to Metal Head's jaw... PING! That one
      really hurt... West's hand, that is. Metal Head isn't
      fazed a bit. West throws another shot, this time to
      the gut... PING! Then a kick to the groin... PING!!!

<b>                                   WEST
</b>                            (incredulous)
                   Noooo.

      Metal Head has had enough. He effortlessly picks West
      up by his lapels and flings him across the room. West
      tumbles, and lands right next to...

<b>      WRENCH
</b>
      He picks it up and starts swinging! A shot to the body
      ... PING! Then another... PING! Then another... PINGGGG!
      Metal Head lurches forward, absorbing each blow with not
      so much as a twitch of the eye. West furries... PING!
      PING! PING! PING!... nothing! He goes for the head...
      PINNNNNNGGGG!... nothing! West is out of time. He's been
      backed up as far as he can go. His heels are dangling
      over the mouth of the beast, a thousand feet above the
      rocky cliff.

       Metal head grunts, grimaces and pitches forward, toward
       West, slowly but menacingly... West braces himself.

       West side-steps and Metal Head falls face first into
       the open air.

       West slowly gets up. Loveless is about to roll over
       him. He jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead
       strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp
       jamming the wheels.

       A smile comes to West's face as he watches Loveless's
       frustrated attempts at going forward and backward.

<b>                                  WEST
</b>                    When you get right down to it,
                    Loveless, you just can't beat

                    You're obviously not a poker
                    player, Mr. West...

       Loveless presses a button, the sound of MECHANICAL GEARS
       ENGAGING. Suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath
       the wheelchair, raising his body to a height of six foot ten.

<b>                                  LOVELESS
</b>                    Two pair always beats a pair.

       West stares up at him slack-jawed. Loveless rolls up his
       sleeves, steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight.

<b>                                  LOVELESS
</b>                    Now... Was it someone particularly
                    close to you who perished in that
                    military action?

       West responds with a roundhouse kick to the chin that
       makes Loveless spin around on the platform of his chair.

                    Hmmm.   Well, that hit a nerve.

       Loveless imitates West by kicking with a lightning flash
       of an alloy leg. It's a rib cracker that sends West
       sprawling.

<b>       CLOSE - WEST'S HAND
</b>
       He's just trying to get up when a cleated metal foot
       stomps down with hundreds of foot pounds per square inch.
       As West screams in pain...

       Gordon tries to come to West's aid, but Amazonia points
       a gun barrel at his temple. Gordon can only watch

       Loveless begins a metallic-flamenco, hands on his hips,
       his piston-like legs kicking West's body and head.

      West can't take much more of this, he's about to pass
      out. Loveless lowers his alloy foot over West's head and
      begins to crush it like a grape.

      Gordon watches in a tortured sweat as his partner tries
      to hold off the metal foot. But he's slowly losing.
      Gordon turns to his female captors, throws his arms out
      beseechingly. When he does, the derringer comes snapping
      out of his sleeve in the device which normally holds his
      pen.

<b>                                 GORDON

      Gordon blinks at the gun. So do Lippenreider and
      Amazonia. Grant knows what to say, if Gordon doesn't.

      pressure of Loveless's leg.

      If possible, West's eyes pop even further.     Gordon shoot?

                   I believe you gentlemen are the
                   polar opposites of a moral
                   dilemma and I'm stuck in the
                   middle. On one end, we have
                   Mr. West, a man of primitive
                   vigours uncomplicated by
                   intellect. And on the other,
                   there's Mr. Gordon. A man of
                   ideas, but unlike myself, lacks
                   the passion to kill for them.
                   He'd like to be able to act his
                   way out of it. And for some
                   reason when he's actin', someone
                   always seems to get killed.

      Loveless puts more pressure on West's head, he groans.
      Gordon aims.

<b>                                  WEST

                   gonna kill your friend here.
                   Then I'm going to kill you.

      POP! The SHOT startles Loveless, West and even Gordon.
      But when Loveless realizes that he's not hit, he laughs.

<b>                                 LOVELESS
</b>                   After all that, you missed.

      He gestures down Loveless's legs to a punctured metal
      tube that's spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over
      the deck -- rendering the foot on West's head, powerless.
      West gets out from under, rubs his neck to regain
      circulation.

                   By the way, your chivalry's about
                   to be tested.

      Charging him. They smash into him, driving him to the

      Gordon realizes this is no time for passivity. He
      retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would
      make West proud. Over the rail, goes Lippenreider. In
      that split-second before she drops, Gordon mouths
      "bye-bye."

      Before he can savor the moment further, Amazonia clubs
      him from behind. Gordon whirls and hits her so hard it
      surprises them both. Over the railing she goes! As
      Amazonia hovers there, President Grant gives her the

      West has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the
      I-beam over his head just as Loveless pulls the triggers
      on both BARRELS... BOOM! BOOM!

      The SHOTS almost blow the heels off West's boots. They

      The sudden stopping jerks Loveless' wheelchair free.
      Despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the
      opposite railing. When the wheelchair hits a pool of
      hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180
      degrees.

      West jumps up, grabs a girder. The wheelchair spins
      under West's legs and then -- CLANK -- it slams into
      the railing and wedges there.

      The impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward, inches
      away from toppling over.


<b>214   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                             214
</b>
      The jolt shoots West off the girder. He free-falls
      through the belly and out into the open air. Thinking
      quickly, he grabs onto the back of Loveless' wheel-
      chair. His arms nearly torn from their sockets. His
      weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it
      hanging on by a thread. West reaches out, grabs the
      wheel of the chair and hangs there.

<b>                              LOVELESS

                With this being the last leg of

                   Mister West!!! I am faced with a
                   difficult decision here. On one
                   hand, there is the overwhelming
                   love that I have for myself, and
                   on the other, the raw, seething
                   hatred I have for you! Now, I
                   could kill you very easily, just
                   by pulling this lever...

      He moves the joystick.    The chair jerks back.

                   with you. I guess the only thing
                   that I can take comfort in is the
                   hope that you would hit those
                   rocks a second before me and I

      It's driven finally into place to a rousing cheer. PULL
      BACK to reveal that President Grant, his sleeves rolled
      up, has delivered the blow.

      Hats in the air, handshakes, pictures. The specter of
      Loveless and his evil plot a fading memory.

      Grant turns to West and Gordon.

      Grant scans the crowd, every race seems present at this
      momentous event. He reaches into his pocket, takes out
      two silver shields.

      He snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it.
      Gordon looks up, very troubled.
