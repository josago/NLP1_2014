</b>
          The man facing us is bearded, sweating, intense,'joyous.
          Jacket and tie, jeans, fortyish. His name is Wittold Levi.
          eXistenZ.
          Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          Written like this. One word.
          Small e. Capital X, capital Z.
          He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          eXistenZ. It's new, it's from
          Antenna Research, and it's here,
          right now.
          We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some
          standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are
          of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud
          enthusiastically.
          We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated
          country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted
          plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman
          - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two
          dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski
          boots.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          My name is Wittold Levi, my
          friends call me Witt - and I'm
          the project manager for eXistenZ.
          I recognize some familiar faces -
          that's all right, that's all
          right. We won't throw you out. We
          encourage consumer loyalty, and
          we want you to help us with our
          product testing. We're a team,
          Antenna and you.
          A delighted stir from the crowd.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          Those of you who have come to our

</b>          tonight, it won't be me. No, for
          the test launch of eXistenZ by
          Antenna, we have brought you a
          seminar leader who is rather
          special.
          An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be?

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          Yes, it is. The world's greatest
          game designer is here, in person,
          to lead you, the first test
          enclave, through her newest
          creation, eXistenZ by Antenna...
          The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed,
          murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess
          herself - Allegra Geller!
          Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it
          until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to
          now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security
          guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an
          electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as
          Ted Pikul (rhymes with "Michael", not with "pickle"), and we
          will see more of him later.
          As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the
          crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part
          like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own
          personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais
          like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog.
          Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is
          bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she
          speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          The world of games is in a kind
          of a trance. People are
          programmed to accept so little,
          but the possibilities are so
          great.

<b>                         (PAUSE)
</b>          You probably thought that
          tonight, we were going to test a
          new game that I designed.
          Excited murmurings from the crowd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          But there is no new game to test,
          at least, not in the usual sense.
          Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          No, no, it's going to be much
          better than you expected, because
          eXistenZ is not just a game. It's
          an entirely new game system.
          Antenna Research and I developed
          it together - the eXistenZ System
          by Antenna - and it involves a
          whole lot of new toys, which you
          are going to be the first to try
          out.
          The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling,
          playing off the renewed energy.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          MetaFlesh.
          Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word.

</b>          Written like this. One word.
          Capital M, capital F. MetaFlesh
          is what our new toys are made of
          - the MetaFlesh Game-Pod, only
          from Antenna Research. It
          connects with any industry
          standard bioport, which I know
          you all have or you wouldn't be
          here...
          (chuckles from the crowd)
          .using, however, a very non-
          standard connecting device which
          we call...
          Levi turns again to the chalkboard.

</b>          .we call an UmbyCord. Spelled
          like this.
          Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now-
          salivating audience.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          I guess you can tell I started
          off as a schoolteacher.

<b>                         4 (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES)
</b>          But I never had anything quite so
          fun or so revolutionary to teach
          as what Allegra and I are going
          to teach you all tonight.
          With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his
          two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices
          on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention
          at either end of it.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by
          Antenna Research ready?

<b>                         ASSISTANTS
</b>
<b>                         (TOGETHER)
</b>          Yes, Mr; Levi.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          And how many of these precious
          prototypes did we manage to bring
          with us?

<b>                         FEMALE ASSISTANT
</b>          Twenty-one, Mr. Levi.
          Levi's face clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the
          following exchange.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>
<b>                         (SOTTO VOCE)

          even two dozen.

<b>                         MALE ASSISTANT
</b>          The first three we opened were...
          unhealthy.

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          Really? Any chance that some of
          the others...?

<b>                         FEMALE ASSISTANT

</b>          God-damn better be.
          Levi turns back to his audience, radiant once more.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         LEVI
</b>          We have twenty-one prototype
          MetaFlesh Game-Pods, and that
          means that for our first wave
          test enclave we need twenty-one
          volunteers who will port in these
          slave units with the Game-Pod
          Goddess herself...
          Levi doesn't need to finish his pitch. Every hand is waving
          in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, "Me, me, oh
          God, please, let it be me!"
          Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity
          of the small crowd's enthusiasm.

<b>          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
</b>
          A SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais
          and are fitted with their game gear:
          The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open
          the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside,
          resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like
          living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods.
          Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player
          UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot
          connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted,
          translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below
          the surface.
          The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to
          receive communion.
          The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases.
          The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the
          back of the game-pods.
          The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are
          lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which
          are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal
          jacks positioned just above the belt line.
          Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the
          dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his
          bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering,
          rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous
          system, on his lap.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed
          i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game-
          pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the
          players on either side of her.
          We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul,
          standing with arms folded near the church's side door,
          watching the proceedings with fascination.
          A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from
          the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens
          it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church.
          Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his
          way.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Hold it. Not so fast.
          In response, the fan thrusts a card at him.
          Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which
          includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats
          his name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul
          into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl
          case slung over his shoulder.

<b>                         DICHTER
</b>          Oh, god. I hope I'm not too late.
          Did I miss the port-in?

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          It's just the first wave. You can
          be part of the second wave.
          (rereads the invitation)
          OK, Joel Dichter. Put your arms
          up. I have to scan you. Metal and
          heavy synthetics can't come in.

          Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens the
          zipper and feels around. In the case is a more solid,
          rubbery version of the new MetaFlesh pods.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          You won't need it tonight.
          Everything's provided for.
          Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais. He almost faints.

<b>                         DICHTER
</b>          Migod! Is that who I think it is?

<b>          .PIKUL
</b>          (with paternal pride)
          Yeah, that's her. She's
          something, isn't she?

<b>                         DICHTER
</b>          But why would a star like her
          come to a product seminar in a
          little one-horse town like this?

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          This is where the real people
          live, Joel. Her real fans, like
          you.

<b>                         DICHTER
</b>          Yeah, well, you said it. Just
          like me.
          Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to
          join the spectators who will form the second wave and re-
          locks the door.
          On the dais, in the center of the circle of linked game
          players, Levi nods at Geller.

<b>                         LEVI

          There is giddy laughter in the room. Geller looks at every
          player-in the circle as Levi steps down off the platform and
          retires to the far edge of the small, watching throng.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          I'm ready to download eXistenZ by
          Antenna Research into you all

          to be a wild ride, but don't
          panic no matter what happens.
          I'll see you all back here in no
          time at all.
          Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous, uncertain, but
          it's too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance
          on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their
          eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have
          suddenly been contacted by the spirit world. The pods in
          their laps begin a rhythmic, peristaltic rippling.
          At the edge of the crowd, Pikul sidles up to Levi.

          A strange, choral humming begins to fill the church. Pikul
          and Levi turn their attention to the dais, where the fans
          rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods in their laps.

<b>                         PIKUL

<b>                         (LAUGHS)
</b>          It's the new Antenna Research
          theme song. We thought this would
          be a good way to launch it.
          Everybody who plays eXistenZ is
          going to be very familiar with
          that tune.
          Haltingly, but gamely, Pikul tries to hum along.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Catchy.
          Levi helps him out, and soon the whole room is humming along
          happily, warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme
          song.
          The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter, who, at
          the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around
          in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder.
          In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete
          game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone
          and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small
          mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is
          the trigger.
          Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few
          gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the
          dais.
          Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's
          still blissed out and humming, then launches himself
          awkwardly through the crowd.
          Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way
          towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his
          weapon as he goes.

</b>          No! Don't do it!
          Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small
          crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter
          hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller.
          The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off
          her chair, which collapses over her and takes the second
          bullet on its seat rim.
          The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and
          jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's
          traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her
          folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and
          confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of
          it. Blood seeps in between her fingers
          Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform
          to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the
          players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately
          goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the
          ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their
          shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain
          transmitting through their UmbyCords.
          Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him
          with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his
          weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But
          before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants
          produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty
          their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to
          squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting
          him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost
          amongst the jostling feet.
          The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the
          players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously
          causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying
          Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at
          whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of
          bodies.
          in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the
          stamping, sliding feet, he finds himself lying across the
          stricken-Levi. Levi clutches Pikul desperately.

          We have enemies in our own house.
          Trust no one. Trust no one...
          The wide-eyed Pikul scrambles to his feet and promptly trips
          over the all-but-dead Dichter. He falls painfully to his
          knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in
          his hand. Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified.
          He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as
          he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their
          way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns
          cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun
          into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly
          looking around for Geller.
          She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a
          few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul
          unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a
          lot of clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one
          arm, screams at them.

          Pikul pulls her to her feet, but she immediately dives back
          to the floor to find her game-pod and UmbyCord.

</b>          (suddenly near hysteria)
          I can't lose this! I can't lose
          this!
          She finds the game-pod still under the folding chair, a bit
          flattened on one side but in one piece. She grabs the game-
          pod and its UmbyCord and stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod
          case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais. As she
          clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and hauls her
          through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded
          dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They
          head for the door, fighting everybody off as though they
          might be lethal.
          As they leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six
          fans, shrieking like monkeys, still stomping and kicking the
          body of Dichter viciously, hysterically, while Levi's two
          assistants carry him to the safety of the church's apse.

<b>          EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT
</b>
          Pikul and Geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves
          standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church. The
          church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside
          a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a
          crossroad.
          Pikul and Geller look around wildly. The vehicles in the
          parking lot are country, pickup trucks, rusted vans, 4x4s.
          Across the road, aloof, maybe too high-class for the parking
          lot, sits a Land Rover Defender 110, the one with the roof
          cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the
          front. Geller gestures towards the Defender.

          They cross the road and jump in the Defender. Frances, the
          driver, sixtyish, a retired lady farmer who moonlights, is
          apprehensive.

          my vehicle.
          Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikul's
          pocket. She points it at Frances.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Get out, Frances. You can say you
          were hijacked.

          squirrel to get me out of this
          seat.
          Geller fires two shots. One rips a hole in Frances's
          headrest.

          They drive off down the country road, leaving Frances in the
          dust.

<b>          INT. DEFENDER LIMO - NIGHT

          Pikul drives. He can see why the limo is an off-road
          vehicle: the road is terrible, dirt and gravel, stutter
          potholes and sharp ridges, the occasional fallen tree.

          summons up a read-out, which she pauses to look at. What she

          Something yellow and white, like a kernel of corn, flips out
          of her wound and onto the road's shredding asphalt. Pikul
          feels around for it, finds it, holds it up to the light.

<b>          EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

          We follow the Defender as it parks outside the Salmon Falls
          Motel. Pikul jumps out carrying two paper bags of Perky
           Pat's takeout. He knees the truck door shut and walks over
          to motel door 5.

          Inside the very basic motel room, Pikul sits hypnotized,
          reverentially watching Geller as he obsessively packs the
          greasy remains of their Perky Pat burgers into the smallest
          possible paper bundle.
          Geller is sitting in the middle of her twin bed, her pod
          before her on a hotel towel which is draped over her lap,
          UmbyCord jacked into her bioport, a second towel slipping
          off her shoulders leaving her almost naked, her shoulder
          wound livid in the 25-watt light of the night table lamp.
          Her hands twitch delicately over the surface of the pod like
          insect antennae, so delicately that we are not sure that she
          is actually touching the pod. Her eyes are half-closed, and
          she is obviously in some kind of trance-like, ecstatic
          state.
          Finally, she comes out of it and unplugs her UmbyCord,
          discretely rearranging her towels in the process. She sighs
          and speaks, not exactly to Pikul.

          In the heat of the summer night, game-pod case still slung
          over her shoulder, Geller wanders around the periphery of
          the gas station, touching things - trees, the ground, grass
          - at random, her expression suggesting that everything she
          sees is amazing and delightful and slightly disturbing, like

          everything is perfect in every detail except that everything

          Gas pulls the trigger on the stud-finder, then removes it
          from Pikul's back. We see a small purple flower-mark, like
          the kind that marks sides of beef, on the skin over Pikul's
          spine just above the belt line. Pikul stands up from his
          kneeling position on the wingback chair. He stretches,
          twists. Everything seems to be all right.

          Gas pulls the bioport insertion gun out of another drawer,
          this time a locked wooden one bolted under his metal-topped
          work bench. It is a scary thing, like a hydraulic jack

          We are close on a bizarre insect which sits unsteadily on
          the chrome of a gas pump handle. Geller's hand comes into
          frame and gently eases the creature into its palm. Geller
          floats her hand closer to her face and studies the creature
          with an expression of rapture on her face.
          The insect is large, praying mantis-sized, and it has two
          heads, neither of which seems to know how to deal with the
          other one. Each time it attempts to move, it falls over in
          an awkward heap because its legs are all different sizes and
          shapes. It beats its large, papery wings wildly in order to
          pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process
          all over again. Eventually, its wing action lifts it off
          Geller's hand - more by accident than will, it seems - and
          the creature disappears in the darkness surrounding the gas
          pumps.

<b>          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
          Wearing mechanic's work gloves, Gas fires in the bioport
          plug. Its impact knocks the breath out of Pikul, like being
          kicked in the spine; he can't even scream. When Gas pulls
          the insertion device away from Pikul's back, we see the
          glossy plastic head of the bioport plug. It's surrounded by
          a small, angry-looking volcano of rashy, irritated flesh.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          That swelling doesn't last for
          long. Tomorrow, you won't even
          notice it.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          I love it. Great.
          Pikul tries to get up from the wingback chair and promptly
          collapses into the arms of Geller and Gas.

          epidural, just like when you have
          a baby. Kinda like instant
          paralysis from the waist down?
          That's why it didn't hurt you.
          It'll wear off in about twenty
          minutes.
          As they ease Pikul into a sitting position in the chair, Gas
          almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in
          one hand. He leans it against the wingback chair, and Pikul
          notices blood and flecks of skin on Gas's work gloves.

<b>                         GAS

          these days, don't they? I'm gonna
          go wash up. You two make
          yourselves at home.
          Gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great
          satisfaction. Geller eases her game-pod out of its case and
          starts to attach its two-player, Y-shaped UmbyCord to it.

          it?
          She lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport. It already
          looks a bit less angry than it did before. Geller caresses
          it, prods it, plays with it. Then she takes out a little
          bottle of WD-40 and sprays it around and into the port.

<b>                         PIKUL

          Geller gently works her UmbyJack into Pikul's bioport. She
          locks her eyes onto his, then squeezes her game-pod's ON
          teat. Instantly, her pod convulses and begins to flash and
          spark and crackle. White electronic smoke seeps from its
          crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its
          pores.
          Geller leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her
          UmbyJack out of Pikul's spine. He can't feel it, but the
          furious force of her move twists him in his chair.

          Gas strolls into the garage, still wearing his work gloves,
          which now hold an agricultural-looking shotgun. It is

          backs away from Gas, clutching her pod protectively.

          that Pikul shoots him right in the mastoid bone, just behind
          the ear, with the bioport insertion gun. The back of Gas's

<b>          INT. WORKSHOP CHALET - DAY
</b>
          In the strange atmosphere of the workshop chalet, Vinokur is
          taking Geller's pod apart. It is more like surgery on an
          alien life form than computer electronics. The room feels
          like a weird combination of a hi-tech operating room and a
          woodworking class.
          A cherubic middle-aged man - Landry - who looks more like a
          farmhand than an electronics technician, assists Vinokur as
          he works.

          stay. Now where did I put my
          bioport-plug puller..? Here it
          is.
          Vinokur hauls out a device that looks like a pair of spring-
          loaded fire tongs.

<b>          INT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT
</b>
          In their chalet, a cozy and inn-like'space, Pikul and Geller
          examine his new bioport while sitting on one of the chalet's
          twin beds. The region around the port looks swollen, bruised
          and tender.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         PIKUL

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          It's not infected. It's just
          excited. It wants action.
          She attempts to jack her pod into his port using the Y-
          shaped UmbyCord, but he twists away from her.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          But I really don't think that I
          want action. Me, I mean. The
          bearer of the excited bioport.
          What I want is... not now. Not
          here. I feel too... too exposed.
          Geller sighs, then switches into her explaining-the-facts-
          of-life-to-a-child mode. They are both aware that they are
          replaying an earlier moment.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          (cradling her pod)
          My baby here has now taken three
          major hits, one in the church,
          one in the gas station, and one
          on the operating table. The only
          way I can tell if everything's OK
          - the game's not been
          contaminated, the pod's not
          fucked - is to play eXistenZ with
          somebody friendly. Are you
          friendly, or are you not?
          Pikul swallows nervously, then turns his back to Geller so
          that she can port in.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          You're telling me this thing will
          run off my body's energy?

</b>          That's how they work. See? You're
          hummin' along already.
          Sure enough, he is. Geller deftly twists the second jack
          into her own bioport and takes a deep breath.

<b>                         GELLER

</b>          You could beat the guy who
          invented poker, couldn't you?
          Geller flicks the game-pod nipple, and the chalet begins to
          melt away around them.

<b>          INT. GAME STORE - NIGHT
</b>
          The chalet melts away and is replaced by a scruffy game
          store. A lot of kids and strange adults mill around amongst
          the dusty racks and pinball machines, examining packages of
          weird games and game devices, muttering secretively to each
          other, and it is amongst these dull rows of shelves that
          Pikul and Geller find themselves standing.
          A cashier works away behind an old-fashioned cash register
          that sits on a tall counter. The cashier, a gangly, sallow
          young man, glances at Pikul and Geller suspiciously from
          time to time.
          Pikul feels himself', his clothes, moves his arms, his
          tongue. He feels around behind him but there is no game-pod
          or UmbyCord in sight.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          That was beautiful. I feel...
          just like me. Is that kind of
          transition normal, a kind of

          place?

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Depends on the style of the game.

          It adapts to the individuals who

          Nader turns his back on them and walks to the back of the
          store. He stops at a warped and dirty door, turns, beckons
          to them urgently, trying not to be noticed by the
          preoccupied patrons.
          As Pikul and Geller follow Nader through the door, they do
          not escape the notice of the sour-faced young cashier, who

          Nader rummages on the shelves behind him for a moment, then

          Pikul is shocked at his own response. He turns to Geller in
          horror, worried that he's blown the game already.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Oh God, what happened? I didn't
          mean to say that!

<b>                         GELLER
</b>
<b>                         (GIGGLING)
</b>          It's your character who said it.
          It's a kind of schizophrenic
          feeling, isn't it? But you'll get
          used to it. There are things that
          have to be said to advance the
          plot and establish the
          characters, and those things get
          said whether you want to say them
          or not. Don't fight it. Just go
          with it.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          But should you be saying that in
          front of him? Nader?

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Look at him.
          Pikul does. Nader doesn't seem to have heard him. In fact,
          he doesn't respond at all other than to hum the Antenna
          Research corporate-song and tap his fingers repetitively,
          caught in a small behavioural loop. Geller chuckles at
          Pikul's confusion.

          locked up, and he won't come out
          of it until you give him a proper
          game line of dialogue.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          This is tricky.

          Nader immediately comes out of his loop. He chuckles.

          Pikul smiles, delighted. Now he takes a deep breath, closes
          his eyes, relaxes. The line comes.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Well, Nader, you said you had
          what we want. We're waiting.

<b>                         NADER
</b>          You're going to need these micro-
          pods to download your new
          identities. I assume that you
          both have had those industry
          standard bioports you mentioned
          installed.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Yes, of course, that's right. We
          both have bioports.
          Here she pauses, looks at Pikul.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          We do, don't we?

<b>                         PIKUL

          In the game. Of course, we might
          not.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          We'd better check.
          While Nader goes into game lock-up, Geller lifts up her
          shirt. Pikul takes a look. Her bioport is there, although
          slightly rougher, puckered, more organic than in non-game
          life.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Yeah, it's there. Looks a little
          different, but it's there.
          Geller grabs Pikul's shirt and lifts it. His is there too.

          you all you need to know for now.
          Pikul and Geller examine the pak, which bears the Cortical
          Systematics name and logo. It seems to be a miniature
          version of their real-life game-pod.

<b>                         NADER
</b>          I'm going to leave while you
          finish up here. It wouldn't be
          good for us all to be seen
          together.
          Nader gets up to leave, pauses at the door.

<b>                         NADER
</b>          Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
          Nader chuckles a very theatrical chuckle, then leaves.

<b>                         GELLER

          just so-so.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          OK. The pods are so small they
          plug directly into the bioport.
          Geller delicately twists the end of the micro-pod into
          Pikul's bioport. The micro-pod changes colour, pulses,
          ripples, and then slowly flows and wriggles its way into
          Pikul's bioport until it has completely disappeared.

          No, I don't. Not a thing. I don't
          feel a thing. Uh, do you want me
          to do you?
          They change positions. Pikul ports in the micro-pod and it
          duly crawls its way into Geller's bioport. Tenderly, as
          though kissing a cut to make it better, Pikul kisses her
          back, low near her bioport. Geller whirls around with sudden
          anger.

          that. Not here, anyway.
          She pauses, then kisses him on the mouth, hard.

          They begin to make seriously hot love amrngst the game paks
          and cartons of replacement UmbyCords. And then the game
          store melts away around them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY
</b>
          Pikul finds himself sitting at an immensely long bench in
          the process of assembling insect motherboards along with
          many other workers. Pikul can still feel the warmth of
          Geller's body, but she's nowhere to be seen. A gritty,
          narrow conveyor belt runs down the middle of the bench, upon
          which floats an endless stream of motherboard parts which
          the workers pick off as they need them. The belt begins and
          ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building.
          The place, a high-ceilinged pre-fab, long and narrow with
          hundreds of blanked-out windows, houses a game-pod assembly
          line. Pikul looks down to find himself wearing a photo-ID
          card clipped to his shirt pocket that tells him he is
          somebody named LARRY ASHEN. He has to twist the card around
          because, of course, from his vantage point it is upside
          down.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          Tryin' to remember who you are?
          Pikul snaps his head up to see a long-haired, morose-looking
          worker sitting next to him, snickering. Mocking Pikul, he
          twists his own card around, comically bunching up his work
          shirt so he can read his own name, which is YEVGENY NOURISH.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          Hey, it works! I must be Yevgeny
          Nourish!
          Nourish leans over to squint at Pikul's name tag.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          And you... you are new to the
          Trout Farm.

<b>                         PIKUL

          you say trout farm?

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          You know - raise baby trout from
          eggs and then stock the rivers
          with them.

<b>                         (BROAD GESTURE)
</b>          Entire place used to be a trout
          farm. Seems like most everything
          used to be something else,

          Pikul looks around him. The place is humming, but Geller is
          still nowhere in sight. The workers are small-town locals o_°
          a wide range of ages.
          Pikul looks down at his own hands, which seem to,know what
          to do: place glue on the boards, glue them down to a resin
          frame using a template, insert needle-like electrodes into
          the bodies of certain epoxied insects. The insect boards,
          Pikul notes, are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and
          frozen together like a sick collage. At least, here in the
          game they are.
          Pikul is now automatically doing flashy moves with the odd
          materials in front of him with great dexterity. Nourish
          takes note of this.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          I (with admiration)

</b>          It surprises me more than it
          surprises you.
          Nourish moves back to the insect motherboard that he has
          been working on, then leans over again exactly as he did the
          first time. It has the effect of an instant replay, but not
          in slow-motion.

<b>                         NOURISH

</b>          You might be new but you seem to

          Pikul realizes he hasn't given the right answer. He now just
          lets it come without thinking.

<b>                         PIKUL

          very best.
          Nourish unlocks and looks around with a delicate
          furtiveness.

          though Pikul didn't exist.
          Pikul takes this cue to go back to his own board and is soon
          preoccupied with testing the board's circuits by porting it
          into a test UmbyCord that uncoils from the center of the
          bench. His strange reverie, watching himself work on auto-
          pilot at this bizarre task, is soon interrupted by a worker
          pushing a canvas and metal cart with bicycle wheels. The
          worker parks the cart behind Pikul and taps him on the
          shoulder.

</b>          They need this in the back room.
          They asked for you.
          The worker shuffles off, leaving the cart behind him. Pikul
          turns to Nourish.

<b>                         PIKUL

</b>          It means that they want you in
          the back room. They need more
          insect boards for the pod
          assembly bays.

<b>                         PIKUL

          there?

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          Yeah. I'll take care of your
          incoming boards.
          Pikul gets up to go. Nourish grabs him by the arm and
          whispers intensely.

<b>          INT. TROUT FARM. POD ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY
</b>
          Pikul enters the huge back wing of the Trout Farm and walks
          along a rampway, pushing his cart past the pod assembly-bay
          area. There, pods very much like the one he and Geller are
          ported into back home are being assembled - motherboards
          inserted, internal ports connected, fleshy housings like the
          corpses of small amphibians sewn up - by small teams of
          workers.
          The bays themselves are old horse stalls with straw still
          covering the dirt floors. But because the pods are primarily
          organic, the teams are more like groups of masked surgical
          workers in a series of impossibly small and filthy operating
          rooms than, let's say, auto-assembly teams in a progressive
          Saab plant.
          As Pikul wheels his cart past each stall, he digs into the
          cart's canvas bag and delivers insect boards wrapped in
          brown wax paper to the eagerly awaiting pod teams.
          In the last bay, one of the masked surgeons grabs him by the
          hand instead of taking the proferred motherboard pnd leads
          himm to an isolated corner. Her ID card says she is BARB
          BRECKEN, and her photo says she is Geller.

          Ashen. What did the guy on the .l
          assembly line say to you?
          Pikul's expression shows that there is a return game line
          welling up in his mouth, tickling his tongue, perhaps.
          Perversely, he fights it, but it comes out anyway.

<b>                         PIKUL

<b>          EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY
</b>
          A ragged stream of pod-assembly workers trickles along a
          densely wooded gravel path towards a very un-Chinese
          Victorian red-brick farmhouse. A small river flows not more
          than fifty feet from the restaurant, mimicking the movement
          of the line of workers.
          The workers all file past a sign on the lawn in front of the
          building which reads, MONA ZHANG'S BEIJING CUISINE.

<b>          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY
</b>
          Pikul and Geller are seated at a round Formica-covered table
          with a lazy Susan serving wheel in the centre of it, all
          very Mandarin in style. Other workers sit sullenly at their
          table, wordless, suspicious.
          A restaurant dog, a mongrel with a lot a heavy, collie-like
          fur, lies basking in a pane of sunlight. in a corner.
          The waiter, a young, athletic Chinese man, comes over
          bringing rice and tea.

<b>                         WAITER
</b>          We have nice sea bass today.
          Shall I bring it for everyone?
          Pikul and Geller exchange a look. Pikul shrugs OK.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          We want the special.
          The waiter looks stunned. The others at their table look
          distressed. The waiter seems to lock up, almost freeze-
          framed.

<b>                         (SLOWLY)

          The waiter unfreezes, smiles grimly.

</b>          The special is for special

          special.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          But this is a special occasion.
          It's...
          Pikul pauses, waiting for the proper game line to
          materialize in his mouth. Finally, it does. He gestures
          towards Geller.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          It's her birthday.
          The waiter locks up for a moment, then unfreezes.

<b>                         WAITER
</b>          A birthday is a special occasion.
          I will therefore bring the
          special for everybody.
          The waiter walks away. The others at the table get up and
          move away, drift over to other tables with occasional
          furtive backward glances at Pikul and Geller.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          I guess the special isn't very
          popular.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          I guess.

<b>                         PIKUL

          You don't have to guess. I mean,

</b>          Correct. I don't.

<b>                         PIKUL

</b>          We ordered it because another
          game character told you to.
          That's a clue we can't ignore.
          But that's just basic games
          playing.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          I want to put the game on pause.
          Geller just looks at him, puzzled. Pikul panics.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>
<b>                         (PANICKING)

          I mean, all games can be paused,
          right?

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Sure, yeah, but why? What's
          wrong? Aren't you dying to see
          what's special about the special?

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          I'm feeling a little disconnected
          from my real life. I'm kind of
          losing touch with the texture of
          it, you know what I mean? I mean,
          I actually think there's an
          element of psychosis involved
          here. I mean, I don't know where
          my body really is, or where
          reality is, what I've actually
          done, or not done.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          That's a great sign. It means
          your nervous system is fully
          engaging with the game
          architecture. The game is a lot
          more fun when it starts to feel
          realer than real.

          The Chinese restaurant melts away.

<b>          INT. GUEST CHALET - DAY
</b>
          The guest chalet melts back up around them. Pikul looks
          around. They are still sitting on the bed, ported into
          Geller's pod together.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Did I do that? I guess I did.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          So how does it feel?

<b>                         PIKUL

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Just sitting here, it feels
          completely unreal. I'm sure you
          knew that would happen.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          You're stuck now, aren't you? You
          want to go back to the Chinese
          restaurant because there's
          nothing happening here. We're
          safe. It's boring.

          here, where we are, is real at

          Pikul looks down at the pod. He flicks the PLAY nipple. The
          room melts down around them and is replaced by the Chinese
          restaurant.

<b>          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          Pikul and Geller are back at their table in the Chinese
          restaurant. The waiter is approaching their table. He
          proudly sets down a series of dishes on the lazy Susan.

          In the dishes are a variety of cooked reptiles, amphibians,
          fish and birds, all weirdly mutated and presented in a
          bizarrely beautiful fashion.

<b>                         PIKUL

<b>                         WAITER

          Geller sees that this is a crucial game moment.

</b>          Very good. Enjoy.
          The waiter leaves. Geller watches him go, suspicious. When
          she turns back to Pikul, she is shocked to see that he has
          served out most of the creatures to himself and is avidly
          stripping the meat off their bones.

<b>                         GELLER

          Pikul looks up from his big bowl, which is rapidly filling
          with creature parts. His fingers are'slimy and sticky, but
          he doesn't stop, his fingers working expertly on their own.

</b>          Yeah. It's a genuine game urge.
          It's something that your game
          character was born to do. Don't
          fight it.

<b>                         PIKUL

          doing me any good.
          Pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone,
          gristle and flesh, a grotesque Lego set. When he's finished,
          he's made a gun very much like the one that was used in the
          attempted assassination in the church.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Omigod, this looks awfully
          familiar. You sure this is OK?

<b>                         GELLER
</b>
<b>                         (NOT SURE)
</b>          It should be OK.
          Now Pikul reaches into his mouth, pulls out a bridge of
          three teeth - one of them gold-filled - and loads them into
          the gristly magazine.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Do you have that bridge in real
          life?

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Absolutely not. My teeth are
          perfect. Don't ask me how I knew
          this thing was in my mouth.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          It probably wasn't until you
          ordered the special.
          He slaps the magazine into the handle, then pulls the slide
          back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in
          the chamber.
          Then with a smile, Pikul points the weapon at Geller.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>
<b>                         (CASUALLY)
</b>          Death to the demoness Allegra
          Geller.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          (suddenly very uncertain)
          That's not funny!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pikul looks at Geller and sees that there is genuine terror
          in her eyes.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Sorry, I couldn't resist. But you
          know... I do feel the urge to
          kill someone here.
          Geller grips the edge of her bowl of hot-and-sour soup - the
          handiest weapon she has.

<b>                         GELLER

</b>
<b>                         (RELIEVED)
</b>          Oh, well, that makes sense.

<b>                         (CALLS OUT)

<b>                         (TO PIKUL)

          hesitate.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          But everything in this game is so
          realistic. I don't think I really
          could...

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          You won't be able to stop. You
          might as well enjoy it.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          "Free will" is obviously not a
          big factor in this little world
          of ours.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          It's like real life - there's
          just enough to make it
          interesting.
          - Pikul spots the waiter making his way across the room
          towards them, a big smile on his face.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          He's too nice. I won't do it.
          The waiter arrives at their table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         53

<b>                         WAITER
</b>          What can I do to make your lunch
          more pleasant?
          Pikul lifts the gun and points it at the waiter.

<b>                         4
</b>
<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          I found this in my soup and I'm
          very upset.
          Pikul fires. The tooth-bullet hits the waiter in the
          cheekbone. A chunk of the waiter's cheekbone comes off and
          his head jerks back like a fighter taking a stiff jab.
          The waiter's sweet face instantly transforms into a hideous,
          angry, snarling mask of hatred. He pulls a meat cleaver out
          of his jacket.
          Geller immediately throws her bowl of hot-and-sour soup into
          the waiter's face. The waiter screams, then wildly wipes the
          noodles and goop out of his eyes. He raises the cleaver over
          his head.
          The waiter swings and lunges across the table, managing only
          to hack the tip of the gun off. Pikul is shocked to see the
          gun begin to bleed. The waiter, sprawling across the table,
          screams as he tries to reach Geller with his cleaver. Pikul

<b>          44.
</b>          fires into the waiter's shrieking, open mouth - a tooth-
          bullet into teeth.
          A piece of the waiter's skull comes off like a piece of
          coconut, the gold-filled tooth now flattened and embedded in
          it. The gun is bleeding all over Pikul's hand now. He drops
          it in disgust.
          The restaurant dog comes out of nowhere, picks the gun up,
          and runs off with it under a table, where he crouches down
          and starts to gnaw on it, growling.
          Pikul stands up shakily, begins to become aware of the
          strange, tense stillness of the other patrons in the
          restaurant.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          (loudly, to room)
          St's all right, just a little
          misunderstanding over the check.
          Pay no attention and enjoy your
          meal.
          To his surprise, the patrons actually turn back to their
          meals, albeit with a certain sinister reluctance.
          Pikul looks around wildly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          I feel a serious game urge to get
          out of here!
          Through the porthole in one of the pair of metal-clad
          kitchen doors, Geller spots someone wearing a che'f's hat,
          someone who is wildly beckoning to them.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Through the kitchen! That way!

<b>          INT. KITCHEN. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
          Geller and Pikul enter the kitchen and take a look around.
          There are mutant amphibians and reptiles hung up everywhere,
          in bowls and on chopping blocks. The kitchen workers have
          all turned to look at the intruders.
          Suddenly, a cook steps forward from around the door. We can
          now see that it is Nourish in a chef's outfit.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          Did you like the meal I prepared
          for you?

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Yes. It was very... revealing.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          It certainly was for me. You both
          passed our little test with
          flying colours.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Why did the Chinese waiter have
          to die?

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          A waiter hears many things spoken
          when people are relaxed and
          eating. A waiter has many
          opportunities for betrayal.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          He betrayed you?

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          He betrayed us. Out this way,
          quickly!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          They go out a side door, and find themselves walking along
          the river that links the Chinese restaurant and the Trout
          Farm.

<b>          EXT. THE RIVER - DAY
</b>
          The trio walk along the bank of the river that feeds the
          Trout Farm. Nourish points out a connected series of rock-
          lined, internally-lighted pools, some stagnant, like ponds,
          and some clear, with river water running through them.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          See there, the breeding pools.
          The pools are all alive with strange creatures, mutated
          fish, amphibians, and, along the small, muddy terraces that
          border the pools, reptiles. Like the dysfunctional insect at
          the gas station, these creatures do not work very well. They
          float and swim belly up, lie on their sides at the bottom of
          their pools, flop and flounder around, and in general,
          ostentatiously fail to function.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Is that where you caught today's
          special?

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>
<b>                         (LAUGHS)
</b>          The restaurant is controlled by
          us. We raise these mutant
          creatures as food and that is our
          cover, but of course, we are also
          raising them as components for
          undetectable and hypoallergenic
          weapons. Right under the noses of
          our enemies. And speaking of our
          enemies, it's important that you
          go back to work at Cortical
          Systematics. We need to maintain
          as many agents there as we can.
          I'll take care of the mess at the
          restaurant.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          The Trout Farm is owned by
          Cortical Systematics?

          A glazed look comes over Pikul. He begins to speak like a
          robotic orator.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>
<b>                         (ROBOT-LIKE)
</b>          Reality is a fragile thing. Most
          people think that reality must of
          course be the most solid thing,
          but it isn't. Reality is
          threatened now more than ever. It
          is being eroded and it is
          washing away in the deforming
          storm of non-reality, which
          masquerades as reality, and
          eventually replaces it. Deformed
          and crippled and limping and
          hideous, threatening to engulf us
          all.
          Geller looks at Pikul in admiring disbelief.

<b>                         GELLER

<b>                         (SOTTO VOCE)

<b>                         PIKUL

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          I'm impressed.
          Nourish is also impressed. He smiles broadly, then takes
          Pikul in his arms and hugs him, then Geller.

<b>                         NOURISH

          Nourish turns around and walks back-towards the restaurant.

<b>                         (PAUSE)

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Yes. So that makes it the game-

          Cortical Systematics is
          equivalent to Antenna Research in
          the real world.

<b>                         GELLER

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          So, then, do we meekly go back to
          work and say nothing? It sounds
          as though Nourish and his
          Realists are preparing to
          sabotage the Trout Farm. Before
          you know it, they'll be planning
          to assassinate game designers.

<b>          INT. GAME STORE - NIGHT
</b>
          We are close on a Cortical Systematics logo on a game-pak.
          As Pikul and Geller pretend to examine the merchandise, they
          scan the game store for Nader. The store is quite crowded -
          same style of customers, maybe even some of the same faces,
          different clothes. They don't see Nader.
          Geller goes up to the cashier, the same gangly, sallow,
          bespectacled young man who was there the first time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         O;

<b>                         GELLER

          The cashier glances around the store, then locks the
          register.

<b>                         CASHIER
</b>          Come with me. He's in the back.
          The cashier leads them through the store towards the
          stockroom door. As they move amongst the customers, both
          Pikul and Geller feel that they are being scutinized
          carefully by shoppers who turn their eyes away from them at
          the last moment, so that they can't be absolutely certain.
          And as for us - have we glimpsed some characters from the
          game that we have already seen? Possibly even Wittold Levi
          from the first scene in the church, and Frances the limo
          driver, and Gas? We aren't positive.

<b>          INT. STOCKROOM. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          The cashier closes the door behind them, then gestures
          towards the back of the stockroom.

<b>                         CASHIER

          Nader lies dead, the unnatural purple of his face eerily
          matched by the veiny purple streaks in the UmbyCord around
          his neck.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          What happened?
          In response, the cashier starts rummaging around on one of
          the shelves. He soon finds what he was looking for, and
          turns around to face them. In his hand is a grotesque,
          slightly chewed gristle gun - the one Pikul assembled in the
          Chinese restaurant - in his hand.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          But we were contacted there by
          Yevgeny Nourish. He seemed to
          know exactly who we were.

<b>                         CASHIER
</b>          That's because Nader tipped him
          off that you were coming. Nader
          was a mole for Cortical

          The cashier puts the gun back on the shelf.

</b>          Nourish is a double agent for
          Cortical Systematics. He was
          working with Nader to subvert the
          Realist cause, and doing it
          rather well.

          You go back to the Trout Farm,
          and in a familiar place, you find
          a mouldy old wicker basket with a

          Someone begins to knock loudly on a door very near by. The
          cashier is oblivious, but'both Pikul and Geller hear it. The
          stockroom begins to morph away as its objects are replaced
          one at a time by chalet objects.

          you to dinner...
          Pikul and Geller sit on the bed, game-pod between them,
          UmbyCord joining them to each other and to the pod. They
          look at each other. Pikul shrugs.

          The door opens slowly to reveal Vinokur, who stands there
          uncertainly, holding a large tray.

          figured you were playing eXistenZ
          to try out your new pod, and your
          new bioport. Everything's all
          right, I take it?
          An awkward moment, as though Vinokur has caught the pair
          having illicit sex. Vinokur moves into the room towards the
          table.

<b>                         VINOKUR
</b>          Can I leave this here for you?
          Don't bother unporting. I just
          had to be sure our star designer
          was in a good place and that
          she'd recovered her multi-
          million-dollar game system from
          her defective pod.
          Vinokur puts down the tray, which holds several plates
          covered by smaller, inverted plates to keep the food warm.

          gone too far psychologically,
          medically, socially, you name it.
          And I'm afraid I wouldn't put it
          past our competitors to be
          involved in this, to try to whip

<b>          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY
</b>
          Pikul and Geller walk down the aisle connecting the assembly
          bays. Other workers drift casually in and out, preparing for
          their day in a desultory fashion.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          The cashier said it would be in a
          familiar place. Is there such a
          thing here?

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          My assembly bay.
          They make their way to the last assembly bay and slip inside
          it. There is, for the moment, nobody else there, but several
          pods have been left on the work tables half-assembled.
          Pikul spots it first, in the far corner: a large, mouldy
          wicker basket in the opposite corner. Something lumpy in it
          is covered by a thread-bare canvas sheet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Is that it over there?
          They stroll over to the basket. Geller kneels down and
          carefully begins to unwrap it while Pikul stands guard.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          I'd say it's exactly as
          advertised.
          The final wrap comes off. In the basket is a necrotic,
          purpled, very diseased-looking pod.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          God, it's ugly. Even for a game-
          pod.

<b>                         (PAUSE)

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          (he thinks she's joking)
          Oh, sure. Yes. Desperate to port
          into it.
          Geller steps over to a bunch of UmbyCords draped over a peg
          and strips one off. She sits down on a rotting wooden
          folding chair next to the death-pod's basket and ports in
          one end of the UmbyCord.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          Here we go. Wanna give me a hand?

<b>                         PIKUL

<b>                         (HORRIFIED)
</b>          You're not serious! I mean,
          that's a diseased pod! Once you

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          (a quick smile)
          Exactly. Help me.
          Pikul kneels beside her as she pulls up her shirt to reveal
          her bioport. Geller hands him the free end of the UmbyCord
          and he ports it into her.

<b>                         PIKUL

<b>                         PIKUL

          infection to them...

</b>          I'm gonna unport you now.
          Pikul tries to unport Geller, but her bioport has swollen
          and seized the jack. He gives the UmbyCord a tug.

<b>                         GELLER
</b>          (in sudden pain)
          0, God, don't! That really hurts!
          Pikul lets go. The death-pod, triggered off by Pikul's
          attempt to disconnect Geller, now begins to convulse in
          peristaltic waves in its wicker basket. Pikul looks around
          desperately and spots a clutch of tools hanging from nails
          on the wall.

<b>                         PIKUL

</b>          No, don't, I'm afraid!
          But Pikul seizes a crude linoleum knife used for trimming
          oversized motherboards and, with three erratic slashes at
          the quivering UmbyCord, hacks her loose. Blood immediately
          pours out of both ends of the severed cord.

<b>          .9
</b>          Panic-stricken, Pikul steps on Geller's end of the cord to
          stop the bleeding. It seems to work, but Geller moans
          horribly.

<b>                         PIKUL

          to do!

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          I know what to do.
          Pikul twists awkwardly around to see Yevgeny Nourish
          standing just behind him. He is in the process of slipping a
          large propane torch off its wall hook.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          I know exactly what to do.
          Nourish unscrews the gas valve and ignites the torch.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          Death to Realism!
          Nourish turns the blazing torch on the pod in the basket.
          Where the cone of flame hits the pod, it begins to shrivel,
          crackle, sputter fat. The pod itself tries to ripple away
          from the searing flame as though it were alive. Nourish
          laughs and begins to play the cone over the entire surface
          of the pod.
          Geller sinks to the ground in exhaustion, holds on to
          Pikul's leg.
          The death-pod now swells and bubbles under the torch's
          flame, then explodes with a dull whump.

          A huge cloud, speckled black and gray, billows upwards and
          floats out over the intersecting walls of the stalls and
          into the main area of the Trout Farm's assembly line, where
          it begins to settle like granular. ash on the startled
          workers.

</b>          Gathering up her last shreds of energy, Geller suddenly
          shoves a startled Pikul off her cord and picks up the
          linoleum knife from where Pikul dropped it.
          Trailing her bloody cord, she lunges at Nourishi driving the
          rusty, curved blade into his back with great force. Nourish
          turns to Geller, the torch circling towards her, wavering.
          He tries to touch her with the flame, staggers.

          Oh, yeah... Barb...
          Nourish drops the torch, falls to the ground and snaps into
          the foetal position. A wall of flame roars up around him,
          fueled by the straw, wood, canvas, pod-oils. Pikul jumps
          over to Geller and picks up the trailing cord, twists it in
          his hands until it stops bleeding.
          All four walls of the assembly bay are on fire now. The
          doorway is a flapping sheet of flame. Mixing with the
          swelling rush of the flame are the sounds of the entire
          plant going on alert: yells, screams, sirens, running feet,
          doors being slammed open and closed.
          Pikul holds Geller tightly. She is limp, weak, drained in
          his arms.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          I think we just lost the game.
          But now, strange, anomalous objects begin to appear out a
          nowhere in the flames - a chair, a tv set, a bath tub, a
          table, objects emerging into the game from the quest chalet.
          After a moment's confusion, Pikul smiles.

<b>                         PIKUL

          embracing the swooning Geller, which he had not expected.

          As Geller swims back up into full consciousness, she begins
          to talk, mumbling at first, then with terrible clarity.

          As though realizing the implications of what she's saying
          for the first time, Geller twists away from Pikul and begins
          to fumble with her UmbyJack.

          he takes a close look at the pod, he can see that it looks -
          unhealthy.
          Geller jumps off the bed and yanks open her bag on the
          table. She pulls out a tiny hypodermic syringe, unwraps it,
          flicks the bubbles out of it, falls to her knees beside the

          it, prod it. She's so close to it we think she might give it

</b>          Oh, God! Pikul, my pod's dying.
          Sure enough, the thing is quivering, rippling, convulsing,
          turning purple.

<b>                         GELLER

          anything for it!
          Geller falls to her knees beside the pod.
          As though triggered by this action, an explosion in the
          nearest chalet blows the windows and the door out of the
          guest chalet. Pikul and Geller are knocked to the floor by
          the impact of the blast.
          Waves of heat and debris billow into the room.
          A moment of eery silence, and then Pikul and Geller peek
          wide-eyed over the-edge of the bed. Flames now engulf the
          nearby chalet, all too clearly visible throught the
          shattered window frames.
          Sounds of pandemonium begin to well up from the hills below,
          and then a figure steps boldly in through the doorway. When
          the flamelight flickers over his face, Pikul and Geller are
          stunned to see that it is the cashier, and he is cradling a
          real-life submachine gun in his arms.
          The cashier screams at the bewildered and terrified pair.

          The cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet.
          She tries to pick up her pod, but the cashier tugs her away
          from it.

<b>                         CASHIER

</b>          But my game! My game's inside it.
          I don't want my game to die.
          The cashier unslings his submachine gun, cocks it, and blows
          the pod into streaks of slime, flesh, and slivers of insect-
          board. Geller is in shock. Pikul turns her to face him,
          speaks' forcefully right into her face, shuts everything else
          out.

<b>                         PIKUL
</b>          Allegra, listen to me. I think
          we're still inside the game. I
          think your real pod's out there
          somewhere, somewhere safe. I
          think it's OK to let go of this
          one, this pod. It's not the real
          one.
          A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters
          against the bed. The bed ignites with an explosive whump.

          The three of them scramble out into the fiery night.

          The cashier leads Pikul and Geller out of the guest chalet
          and down the mountain path. The chalet next to theirs begins
          to implode as they scurry by it.
          As they flee, they realize that all the chalets are on fire.
          There are people trying to fight the fires, running
          r frantically everywhere with hand-held extinguishers. There
          is also scattered gunfire, but who's firing on whom is
          impossible to tell.

          can pull the trigger, he jolts backwards and falls twitching
          to the ground.
          From the shadows of the trees, backlit by the fiery
          landscape below, steps Kiri Vinokur. In his hand he holds
          the gristle gun which Pikul assembled in the Chinese
          restaurant.

          Geller seems to have lost the thread. She wanders over to
          the cashier's body and disentangles his submachine gun from
          him.

          the cashier's body on the grass, opens fire at Vinokur with
          the submachine gun. Vinokur falls with a startled expression
          on his face.
          Pikul, absolutely horrified, runs at Geller and kicks the

          eyes just beginning to flutter open. But Pikul is sitting
          next to her, also playing the game. And next to him is
          Nourish, whom we are even more surprised to see in this
          context.
          Aad in fact, the players who are sitting in the circle of
          chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the
          movie up to this point: Nader, the cashier, Dichter, Gas,
          Vinkokur, even Frances, the limo driver.
          The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended
          - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir
          in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod-
          technology we have just seen.
          On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with
          electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality
          equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps
          they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules,
          each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which
          I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder
          version of the bioports we have become used to.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are
          two security guards, neither of whom is Pikul, of course. On
          a leash, one of the security guards holds the dog that, in
          the game, picked up the gristle gun in the Chinese
          restaurant.
          Also monitoring the action are a woman, Merle, who is the
          game's actual project manager - the real-life version of the
          game-character Levi - and her two assistants.
          There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the
          players, and now they are free to remove their thumbs from
          the game modules and slide their head-gear off.
          The two assistants - the real-life ones are both matronly
          women - begin to help everyone unplug, neatly gathering up
          the equipment in padded bags as they go.
          A broadly smiling Merle mounts the dais and stands in the
          centre of the ring of players.

<b>                         MERLE
</b>          Are you all back?
          The man whom we knew in the game as Yevgeny Nourish
          immediately stands and takes charge. But it is a different
          Nourish, exuberant, sensitive and artistic.

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          We're back, Merle. Although I
          have a feeling some of our crew
          might not realize it yet.
          Shaky laughter from some of the players.
          Throughout the following round of comments from the garners,
          whom we now realize have been, up to now, playing characters
          in a game, we hear nothing from Pikul and Geller. These two,
          who sit next to each other and are now holding hands, remain
          enigmatically silent.

          Hey, but you two were fantastic.
          You guys are game divas! I think
          you both deserved to win.
          There is general agreement amongst the garners about this
          compliment to Pikul and Geller. The pair just smile sweetly
          and bob their heads modestly at the smattering of applause.

</b>          (a little jealous)
          Well me, I was really bummed out
          at first. I got knocked out of
          the game so soon. It was fun to
          watch the rest, though. I liked
          that part where the ones who got
          knocked out of the game early got
          to be spooky customers in the
          game store.

<b>                         LEVI

          So scary and crazy. I had a lot
          to do in that first scene in the
          church but I thought my character
          was kind of boring.

</b>          Well, you know, I'm a gas-jockey
          in real life, so I was kind of
          disappointed that I was basically
          the same thing in the game. A

          have to turn them in because
          they're beta versions, pre-
          production hand-made specials,
          and we need to study them after
          use for wear and tear and other
          things. But you'll get a
          certificate for helping us out

          game modules to hit the market,
          and at a seriously discounted
          price. You're gonna love it.
          Amidst applause and general excitement, Merle turns to the
          tripod-mounted chalkboard standing, as in the first scene,
          at the back of the dais. There we see the words that she has
          already written: TranscendenZ by PilgrImage.

          chance to play the role of a star

          up on my ambitions to be like

</b>          well, let me first say that I'm
          kinda glad I lost this game. I
          don't usually play such nasty
          characters.

<b>                         (LAUGHTER)

          be long before PilgrImage is

          And maybe you should take your
          friend Ted, here, Mr. Pikul, with
          you. He's obviously good in a
          crisis, and when you design
          games, there are plenty of them.
          Amid the renewed good-natured laughter, Geller blushes. She
          reaches out for Pikul's hand.

          some questions, before the game
          half-life wears off. First, let
          me thank you for taking part in
          this test seminar. PilgrImage
          wants to deliver nothing but the
          finest to the game enthusiast,
          and you have all been a proud
          part of that process tonight.
          When we've collected all the
          head-sets and game modules, we'll
          be handing out a questionnaire to
          each of you, and I'd like your
          answers to the questions to be as
          honest, as brutal, as clear as
          you can make them. Don't hold
          back. After that, we're going to
          form a focus group where we'll
          discuss details of each of your
          experiences playing TranscendenZ.
          You've all had different but
          interlocking lives in the game,
          and I think you'll be amazed when
          you hear each other's stories.

          While the questionnaires are being handed out by the

<b>                         (INTENSE)
</b>          Merle, I was very disturbed by
          the game we just played.

<b>                         MERLE
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          It had a very strong, very real
          anti-game theme. I mean, it began
          with the assassination of a game
          designer.

<b>                         MERLE
</b>          or Really? But that's very creative.

<b>                         (PAUSE)
</b>          But on second thought, I see what
          you mean. It makes me nervous.
          You think it must have come from
          one of our game players?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         NOURISH
</b>          It sure didn't come from me. The
          tone of it in the game was very,
          very passionate, fanatical. And
          the atmosphere of paranoia and
          betrayal was overwhelming. The
          whole thing felt unstable,
          dangerous, volatile. But worse
          than that, there was a kind of
          industrial espionage subplot.
          Stealing game-systems, jumping
          ship from one game company to
          another. That kind of thing.
          They both reflexively begin to scan the gaming group, who
          are all innocently dealing with their question cards.

          have been infiltrated here, and
          if we have, we've got a big

          right now!
          But it's too late. Geller reaches down and pulls a flap of
          false fur and skin away from the dog to reveal two semi-
          automatic pistols strapped to the dog's flank. Pikul and
          Geller grab the guns, pull back the slides, and cooly
          execute Merle and Nourish, who bump grotesquely together as
          they slump to the ground.
          In the stunned silence that follows, only the clatter of the
          last few shells bouncing around on the hardwood floor can be
          heard. Pikul and Geller glance at each other,. pumped, then
          fill the silence.

</b>          Now a hesitant shuffling of feet causes Pikul and Geller to
          whirl and catch the security guards coming at them with
          their pathetic scanning wands. The guards stop in their
          tracks, raise their hands, and start to back away as the
          place suddenly explodes in screams and pandemonium.
          As Pikul and Geller in their turn back towards the front
          exit, they glide past the young Chinese man who was the
          waiter in the game. The waiter stands flattened out in fear
          against a pillar with his questionnaire and his pencil in
          his hand.
          They ignore the waiter, but stop to wait for Pikul's dog to
          trot calmly past them, heading for the door.
          Now Pikul and Geller are just about to turn and follow the
          dog when the waiter unfreezes and takes a step away from the
          pillar towards them. They immediately swing their pistols
          over towards him. The waiter stops and raises his hands.

          me. I just wanted to ask you a

</b>          Hey, tell me the truth. Are we
          still in the game?
          Pikul and Geller look at each other, then into the camera.
          The church melts down around them into blackness.
