          Pulled from its sheath, intricate tribal etchings on the
          blade catching the light.

          The blade being pulled across a sharpening stone. Swoosh-
          swoosh-swoosh. Rhythmic. A well-practiced hand. A muscular,
          tattooed arm.

          The blade held up. Razor sharp. The glow of a TV in the
          darkened room is the only illumination.
          We see images on the TV:

          filling the streets. Soldiers moving into position. We see
          placards: "DOGS MUST EAT," "MEAT WAS MADE FOR MOUTHS."
          The man sharpening the knife watches the images. His eyes are
          cold. Almost disinterested.

          Then he stops.
          Frozen in mid-stroke.
          Something on the TV suddenly rivets him.
          His eyes no longer cold.

          The TV shows one of the soldiers, a high-ranking officer.
          Imperious. Giving orders. We will come to know this is a man
          as Caius Martius -- Coriolanus.

          TULLUS AUFIDIUS, the man sharpening the knife, gazes at the
          image on the screen.

          He leans forward. Emerging from the darkness. We see his
          face.

          He is a handsome and imposing figure, magnetic in his
          personality. Charismatic, yes, but also neurotic and edgy.
          Uncomfortable in his own skin. Some demons there.

          We move with an intense woman down the street. She is
          nervous. Checks she is not being followed.
          She is TAMORA, an extreme figure on the political landscape.
          To the Roman elite she is a dangerous anarchist -- to her
          supporters she is an ardent patriot and democrat.
          As she moves, we take in Rome.
          It might be Mexico City. Or Chechnia. Or El Salvador. Or
          Detroit. Or Baghdad. Or London.
          This Rome is a modern place. It is our world right now:
          immediately recognizable to us. Elements of classical
          architecture loom over decay. Monolithic modernism and brave
          public monuments are lost in a sea of brazen advertising
          billboards, neon shopping plazas and drab super-highways.
          Splendor and squalor sit side-by-side.
          It is a volatile, dangerous world.

          gathered, hushed and urgent tones. A cell meeting of the
          political opposition, the resistance.

          rotates the blade.

          Martius is seated with several MILITARY OFFICERS and AIDES.
          Also with him is TITUS. He younger than Martius, an old
          friend and comrade-in-arms. Like Martius he has seen a lot of
          battle.
          COMINIUS, an older general, enters. He is an experienced
          commander of men also used to dealing with the necessary
          politics of civilian oversight. West Point bearing.
          All salute. Cominius returns the salute.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          The news is the Volsces are in arms.
          An aide presses a remote. Grainy video images play on a
          monitor: Volscian soldiers, jeeps, tanks.
          One section shows a quick image of the rebel leader, a
          striking man called Tullus Aufidius, riding past in a jeep.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          They have a leader,
          Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to it.

</b>          He is a lion
          That I am proud to hunt.
          Martius takes the remote control. Stops the video. Rewinds to
          the unclear image of Aufidius.

</b>          Lead you on.
          Martius rewinds and plays the image of Aufidius again,
          rewinds and plays it again, almost obsessively.
          We push in on the video image of Aufidius...
          Aufidius appears to be staring right back at Martius...
          And this takes us to...

<b>          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-WAR ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          The same face.
          Aufidius, who is the leader of the rebel Volscian forces,
          stands deep in thought.
          The Volsces are an insurgent force challenging the monolithic
          might of Rome: rebels that suggest to us Latin American
          revolutionaries or Hamas fighters or Chechnian separatists.
          They are a dangerous guerilla force.
          We are in the Volsce war room in an old apartment building. A
          basement. No windows. Secure.
          OFFICERS and some civilian POLITICIANS. The room is filled
          with military maps, weapons, surveillance photos.

          He tosses a glossy magazine on the desk, a picture of Martius
          on the cover.
          Aufidius' eyes spark at the image of Martius.
          He picks up the magazine and carefully tears off the cover
          picture of Martius, looking at the picture deeply.
          He continues with a strange and grim fire:

<b>          EXT. MARTIUS VILLA - DAY
</b>
          A beautiful butterfly. Catching the light perfectly, almost
          iridescent.
          It floats before a palatial mansion in the suburbs of the
          great city. Manicured lawns. Formal gardens. Classical
          architectural lines.
          This fine home of aristocratic privilege seems a world away
          from the urban blight of Rome.
          In the immaculate front gardens YOUNG MARTIUS, Martius' son,
          is playing. The boy is about ten. There is something grim and
          lonely about him, without charm.
          Young Martius chases after the butterfly, trying to catch it.
          He fails. The butterfly flits away. Young Martius leaps after
          it. Again he misses.
          Finally the frustrated boy manages to catch the butterfly. In
          his rage he tears it to pieces, brutally shredding it.
          We realize he is being observed...

<b>          INT. MARTIUS VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          . VIRGILIA, Martius' wife, stands at the window. Disturbed
          by the sight of her son ripping apart the butterfly.

          on his fingers. Young Martius is unmoved. He glances up.
          Locks eyes with his mother.
          She turns away.
          Virgilia was well-chosen for her role as wife to one of
          Rome's most aristocratic men. She is beautiful and graceful
          but -- like Diana thrown into lion's den of the Windsor
          family -- woefully out of her depth. We feel an inner
          fragility to her.
          The room is spacious and elegantly appointed. A lovely Roman
          statue in one corner. This is a place of wealth, order and
          control.
          A fine flat-screen TV flickers with images of war. We see
           helicopters zooming over desert landscape Imbedded war
          correspondents Tanks Combat Romans . Volscians.
          VOLUMNIA, Martius' mother, stands and watches the TV. She is
          an imposing woman, handsome and tall, impeccably dressed.
          Adamantine in her strength.
          Virgilia moves from the window. Sits on a sofa. She watches
          the TV news footage of the war, upset by the images.
          A frozen silence.

          won honor than in the embracements of his
          bed where he would show most love.
          She moves across the room to fetch a cigarette. She moves,
          always, with stately grace.
          She walks past a series of photographs. They tell the story
          of Martius' life: the happy baby; the stern dead father; the
          rigid young military cadet; the formal wedding; the
          restrained and unsmiling adult.
          In the photos we sense a transformation: innocent boy to
          experienced, severe looking soldier. Volumnia is present in
          most of the pictures.

<b>          EXT. CORIOLES - DAY

          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! A series of explosions jolt us.
          Corioles is a small urban center. Smoke billows up from areas
          of the city. The steady crack and rattle of gunfire. The
          occasional thud of explosions.
          We see urban street-to-street fighting. The images are
          startling in their familiarity: this could be Basra or
          Belfast.
          The battle is photographed in a gritty exposure. Color is
          drained out -- blood is a darker red like oil. Soldiers are
          dark forms moving through shadows and smoke.
          Martius and Titus, leading a platoon of around twenty Roman
          SOLDIERS, run into view and take cover. Bullets zip and snap

          The value of her own. It were a

<b>                         CONCEALMENT
</b>          Worse than a theft,
          To hide your doings.

<b>                         MARTIUS
</b>          I have some wounds upon me, and they

<b>                         SMART
</b>          To hear themselves remembered.
          The surgeon finishes stitching Martius' arm. Starts to clean
          another wound.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          Should they not,
          Well might they fester against

<b>                         INGRATITUDE
</b>          Too modest are you.
          Impatient, Martius rises, painfully and slowly. He takes his
          canteen and crosses to the Young Soldier. Gives his canteen
          to the boy. The Young Soldier drinks. His deep, sad eyes gaze
          up at Martius.
          Martius watches as...
          The Young Soldier dies. The light goes from his eyes. His
          head hangs awkwardly. His boyish face is leaden.
          Martius suddenly finds himself exhausted. Morally and
          physically spent.

</b>          I will go wash;

<b>                         PERCEIVE
</b>          Whether I blush or no Howbeit,
          thank you.
          Martius stares at the dead soldier.

<b>          EXT. CORIOLES-STREET - NIGHT
</b>
          Aufidius and some of his Volscian soldiers, bloody and
          filthy, are on foot.
          They are moving through the outskirts of Corioles, leaving
          the city. Exhausted after the long and failed battle.
          Fires burn from blasted shops and homes. The Romans have
          clearly laid waste to this part of the city.
          There is a minivan stopped ahead of them. Bullets holes
          everywhere. Bodies inside.
          They walk to it. Aufidius looks in. A dead family. Father,
          mother, kids in the back. Bloody toys on the floor of the
          minivan.
          Roman atrocities.
          Aufidius gazes at the bodies. His face hardens.
          He whispers to himself:

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Five times, Martius,
          I have fought with thee; so often hast
          thou beat me,
          And would do so, I think, should we

<b>                         ENCOUNTER
</b>          As often as we eat.
          He becomes aware some of his men are looking at him,
          disturbed at his fervor.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>
<b>                         FOR WHERE
</b>          I thought to crush him in an equal force,
          True sword to sword, I'll stab him some
          way,
          Or wrath -- or craft -- may get him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          27.

<b>                         SOLDIER
</b>          He's the devil.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Bolder, though not so subtle.
          A beat. Aufidius continues with prayer-like intensity:

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          My valor, poisoned with him,
          Shall fly out of itself ...
          Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked,
          Sick, the prayers of priests,
          Nor times of sacrifice,
          Shall lift up their rotten privilege
          And custom,
          Against my hate to Martius.
          In the shattered glass of the minivan window, Aufidius
          suddenly sees himself.
          He studies his own face, nurturing his dark thoughts.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Where I find him, were it
          At home, upon my brother's guard, even
          there,
          Will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.

<b>          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY
</b>
          Back in Rome, we are at a comfortable restaurant/bar near the
          Senate where politicians gather to eat, drink, gossip and
          conspire. The business of state is conducted over steak and
          martinis.
          Comfortable red leather booths. Wooden panelling.
          Two Tribunes -- Senators chosen to speak for the people --
          are having lunch.
          BRUTUS is a large man in a rumpled grey suit; a sweating bear
          with a taste for bare-knuckle politics. SICINIUS is smaller
          and vulpine; crafty and cold.
          Both are ambitious politicos used to manipulating the people
          and the press for their personal ends. With them sits
          Cassius, the political agitator we met before.
          The TV over the bar shows images of Martius' victory:
          parading Roman troops; Volscian prisoners; flags; adoring
          crowds; triumphant slogans; "Mission Accomplished."

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          28.
</b>
<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?

<b>                         CASSIUS
</b>          He has no equal.

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          When we were chosen Tribunes for the

<b>                         PEOPLE-
</b>
<b>                         BRUTUS
</b>          Marked you his lip and eyes?

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          Nay, but his taunts.
          They see Senator Menenius approaching. Sicinius nods to
          Cassius, who quickly goes.
          Menenius stops by on his way out. He is jolly, knowing the
          victory will assure his protege's political future:

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          The augurer tells me we shall have news
          tonight.

<b>                         BRUTUS
</b>          Good or bad?

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Not according to the prayer of the
          people, for they love not Martius.

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          Nature teaches beasts to know their
          friends.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          You blame Martius for being proud?

<b>                         BRUTUS
</b>          We do it not alone, sir.
          Subtly, the polite chit-chat is turning more serious and
          pointed; Menenius growing sharper. The gloves are coming off.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          I know you can do very little alone
          You talk of pride: 0 that you could turn
           your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
           and make but an interior survey of your
          good selves! 0 that you could!

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          29.
</b>
<b>                         BRUTUS
</b>          What then, sir?

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Why, then you should discover a brace of
          unmeriting, proud, violent, testy
          magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.
          The saturnine Sicinius' response seems almost a threat:

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          Menenius, you are known well enough too.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          I am known to be a humorous patrician,
          and one that loves a cup of hot wine with
          not a drop of allaying water in it; one
          that converses more with the buttock of
          the night than with the forehead of the
          morning. What I think I utter, and spend
          my malice in my breath.

<b>                         BRUTUS
</b>          Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          You know neither me, yourselves nor
          anything You are ambitious.
          A tense beat. They are formidable adversaries.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Good-e'en to your worships. More of your
          conversation would infect my brain, being
          the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians
          I will be bold to take my leave of you.
          He goes. The Tribunes watch him cut through the lunch crowd
          and exit.

<b>          EXT. SENATE - DAY
</b>
          The Roman Senate is constructed with classical symmetry and
          clean, square lines. Probably the most striking and beautiful
          building in Rome.

<b>          INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
          Volumnia, Virgilia and Menenius are hurrying down a corridor,
          excited. All are well-dressed, for an important public event.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          30.

</b>          Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius
          approaches! For the love of Juno, let's
          go.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Is he not wounded? He was wont to come
          home wounded.

<b>                         VIRGILIA
</b>          0, no, no, no...

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>
<b>                         (VICTORIOUSLY)
</b>          0, he is wounded! I thank the gods for

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          So do I too -- if it be not too much.
          Brings a victory in his pocket, the
          wounds become him. Has he disciplined
          Aufidius soundly?

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Titus Lartius says they fought together,
          but Aufidius got off.

<b>                         VIRGILIA
</b>          In truth, there's wondrous things spoke
          of him. Gods grant them true.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          (an exhalation of scorn)
          True?!

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he
          wounded?
          Volumnia and Menenius now gleefully add up her son's wounds
          like accountants -- or campaign managers.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          In the shoulder and in the left arm.
          There will be large scars to show the
          people, when he shall stand for his place
          He received in the repulse of Tarquin
          seven hurts in the body.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          One in the neck, and two in the thigh -
          there's nine that I know.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          He had, before this last expedition,
          twenty-five wounds upon him.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Now it's twenty-seven. Every gash was an
          enemy's grave.
          We focus on Volumnia's face as she thinks about her son.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>
<b>                         BEFORE HIM

</b>          Which, being advanced, declines, and then
          men die.
          They hurry to the stop of a grand staircase, where there are
          people waiting...

<b>          INT. SENATE-STAIRS - DAY
</b>
          They join Cominius and other dignitaries at the top of a
          majestic stairway.
          An honor guard of Roman soldiers in dress uniforms are
          waiting. Roman flags flutter. All very ceremonial.
          Martius enters below. The honor guard snaps to attention.
          Martius -- hereafter called Coriolanus -- slowly begins to
          cross to the steps. We see that walking is very difficult
          for him. His wounds are severe and every movement is agony.
          He has paid a steep price for his victory.
          Photographers flash photos and a TV crew film the ceremony.
          Coriolanus finally reaches the steps leading up. He takes a
          breath and slowly begins to climb the stairs, each step a
          challenge.
          Volumnia looks down on him. Unmoved by his pain.
          Virgilia is distraught.
          As Coriolanus slowly hauls himself up the last few steps,
          General Cominius speaks into a cluster of microphones and
          addresses the press:

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          32.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          Be it known,
          As to us, to all the world, that Caius

<b>                         MARTIUS
</b>          Wears this war's garland And from
          this time,
          For what he did before Corioles, call
          him,
          With all the applause and clamor of the
          host,
          "Caius Martius Coriolanus!"

<b>                         (TO MARTIUS)
</b>          Bear the addition nobly ever!
          The soldiers salute in a grim sort of chant:

<b>                         SOLDIERS
</b>          Caius Martius Coriolanus!
          Coriolanus has reached the podium. An awkward beat. Cominius
          gestures for him to speak into the microphones.
          He tersely does so:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          No more of this; it does offend my heart.
          Pray now, no more.
          An awkward silence. Cominius elegantly tries to covers the

<b>                         MOMENT:
</b>
<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          Look, sir, your mother.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>
<b>          0,
</b>          You have, I know, petitioned all the gods
          For my prosperity.
          He kneels to her -- slowly, with great difficulty -- she lets
          him.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Nay, my good soldier, up.
          (he slowly rises)
          My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and
          By deed-achieving honor newly named -
          What is it? - Coriolanus must I call
          thee?
          She laughs coquettishly, thoroughly upstaging her son.
          Then, almost an afterthought:

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          33.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          But, 0, thy wife...
          Coriolanus greets Virgilia with the clumsy and stiff
          formality that marks their marriage.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          My gracious silence, hail.
          An awkwardly tender kiss. He notes her tears. Reacts coldly.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Would thou have laughed had I come
          coffined home,

          dear,
          Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear,
          And mothers that lack sons.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          A hundred thousand welcomes!
          Coriolanus is surrounded by well-wishers and political
          admirers. Volumnia and Menenius usher him along.
          We see the image from TV: The noble warrior returned home.
          Devoted family. Flags waving. The future golden.

<b>          INT. VILLA-BATHROOM - EVENING
</b>
          And then the hard reality.
          Coriolanus' body is a battleground of scars. Some are livid
          and red, fresh and still oozing blood. Others are pale and
          blue, discolored and dead.
          His body is something monstrous. Stitched up. Patched
          together. Slashed around. Frankenstein's monster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          34.
</b>          He is leaning against a sink, stripped naked. His muscular if
          shattered body exposed.
          Volumnia sits and dresses her son's wounds. As she always has
          done. As she always will.
          It is a disturbing, intimate image.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          The good Senators must be visited;
          From whom I have received not only
          greetings,
          But with them change of honors.
          He shifts painfully as she continues to treat one of his
          wounds.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          I have lived

<b>                         NOT BUT
</b>          Our Rome will cast upon thee.
          He catches her eye in the mirror, very firm:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Know, good mother,
          I had rather be their servant in my way,
          Than sway with them in theirs.
          They stop when--
          Virgilia enters.
          She stops in the doorway. It is embarrassing for her, as if
          she has interrupted two lovers. A long moment.
          She looks to her husband.
          To Volumnia.
          They stare back.
          There is no way she can compete with their intimacy.
          Surrendering, she silently goes.

<b>          INT. VILLA -- HALLWAY - EVENING
</b>
          Virgilia wanders a long hallway, past a fine collection of
          antique Roman weaponry. She seems lost.

          Young Martius is asleep.
          Her eyes move across his room. The military toys. The little
          cadet uniform carefully hung. The polished boots waiting.
          All stern and joyless. Not like a child's room at all.
          Virgilia closes the door and continues down the long hallway,
          disappearing into darkness.

<b>          INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
          Brutus and Sicinius make their way to their seats as we hear:

<b>          MENENIUS (V.0.)
</b>          It remains,
          As the main point of this our after-
          meeting,
          To gratify his noble service that
          Hath thus stood for his country...
          The interior of the grand Senate is an airy, sweeping chamber
          that suggests the Israeli Knesset or U.N. General Assembly.
          Again, classical symmetry is the rule with tiers of seats
          facing a central dais. An imposing piece of outdated modern
          art suggesting the might of Rome looms over the chamber like
          a bird of prey.
          Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner.
          Menenius, Cominius, Coriolanus and several other politicos
          are seating at a central table on the dais, facing the rows
          of SENATORS.
          Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone:

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Therefore, please you,
          Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
          The present Consul, and last general
          In our well-found successes, to report
          A little of that worthy work performed
          By Caius Martius Coriolanus.

<b>                         SENATOR
</b>          Speak, good Cominius.
          General Cominius rises and moves to the podium.
          But then Coriolanus abruptly stands--

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Nay, keep your place.

<b>                         SENATOR
</b>          Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear
          What you have nobly done.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          37.
</b>
<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Your honors' pardon.
          I had rather have my wounds to heal again
          Than hear say how I got them.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Pray now, sit down.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          I had rather have one scratch my head in

<b>                         THE SUN
</b>          When the alarum were struck than idly sit
          To hear my nothings monstered.
          Coriolanus moves across the dais and exits into a hallway.
          The door shuts after him.
          Menenius sighs. Nods to Cominius.
          Cominius moves to the podium and begins to read his speech
          from a Teleprompter. This all has the rehearsed quality of a
          campaign nomination speech.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          The deeds of Coriolanus
          Should not be uttered feebly. It is held
          That valor is the chiefest virtue, and
          Most dignifies the haver. Alone he

<b>                         ENTERED
</b>          The mortal gate of the city,
          And struck Corioles like a planet,
          From face to foot
          He was a thing of blood...
          Brutus and Sicinius exchange a glance, bored by the political
          boilerplate.

<b>          INT. SENATE-SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
          Meanwhile, Coriolanus stands in the service corridor beyond
          the chamber. Green industrial walls. Ugly fluorescent lights
          above.
          He leans against a wall, alone with his thoughts.
          Cominius' voice can be heard droning inside.
          Then Coriolanus glances up. A CUSTODIAN is pushing a garbage
          can down the long corridor. He stops when he sees Coriolanus.
          Coriolanus' cool, uncompromising stare makes the Custodian
          uneasy. He turns around and goes back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          38.
</b>          Coriolanus waits. His face strangely vacant.
          He flexes his wounded arm. It hurts.
          He hears Cominius finish. A good round of applause. He hears
          his name being cheered: "Coriolanus!"
          Coriolanus closes his eyes, steels himself, and then re-
          enters the chamber...

<b>          INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
          Menenius greets him and escorts him to the podium for his
          "acceptance speech."

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
          To make thee Consul!
          Menenius steps back.
          A beat.
          Coriolanus stares at the Senators. At the TV cameras.
          He leans awkwardly into the podium microphone:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          I do owe them still
          My life and services.
          A beat.
          For an acceptance speech, rather terse. Menenius jumps in to
          salvage the moment:

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          It then remains
          That you do speak to the people.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          I do beseech you,
          Let me overleap that custom, for I cannot

<b>                         ENTREAT THEM
</b>          For my wounds' sake to give their
          suffrage.
          Please you that I may pass this doing.
          From the Senate floor, Sicinius jumps on this:

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          Sir, the people

<b>          39.
</b>          The Senators, led by Brutus, clamor their agreement.
          Tradition must be obeyed.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          (calming, to Coriolanus)
          Pray you, go fit you to the custom.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          It is a part
          That I shall blush in acting, and might

<b>                         WELL
</b>          Be taken from the people.
          Menenius quickly turns off Coriolanus' microphone.

<b>                         BRUTUS
</b>
<b>                         (TO SICINIUS)
</b>          Mark you that?

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
          Show them the unaching scars which I
          should hide,
          As if I had received them for the hire
          Of their breath only!
          Menenius sees Coriolanus is getting angry, this could be
          disastrous.
          He elegantly gestures for Cominius to escort Coriolanus out
          immediately -- as he addresses the Senators and TV cameras:

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          To our noble Consul
          Wish we all joy and honor!
          He applauds. The applause is taken up by the Senators. Some
          cheering as well for the hero of Rome The two Tribunes,
          however, are already whispering maliciously to other
          Senators.
          Menenius seems pleased with the general response. So far, so
          good.

          Roman marketplace.
          Coriolanus sits with Menenius. Coriolanus is both angry and
          embarrassed. He is wearing a sharp business suit.

<b>                         MENENIUS

          The limo stops. They are at the marketplace. The moment has
          come.
          Menenius takes a breath. Urges calm:

<b>          EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY
</b>
          The commercial heart of Rome. A large town square, since
          antiquity used as a marketplace.
          But now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses
          and knock-off watches. Paltry fruit stands alongside shabby
          souvenir stalls.
          Advertising billboards surround and pollute the square --
          SONY. COKE. NIKE. MCDONALDS -- obscuring any classical
          architecture that might have survived.
          Tamora and Cassius, the political activists, are in the
          crowd. They watch closely.
          Coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace. He
          stands, feeling ridiculous and not at all humble.
          He looks around.
          Waiting for something to happen.
          The CUSTOMERS and SHOPKEEPERS just look back at him. Some are
          curious. Some are amused. Some hostile and most indifferent.
          But no one approaches.
          Then Coriolanus understands. He must g to them: beg for
          votes.
          He prepares himself and then slowly moves through the various
          stalls, weaving in and out. Trying to maintain his dignity.
          He sees the Citizens from before and goes to them. We glimpse
          Brutus and Sicinius amongst the crowd.

</b>          You must think, if we give you anything,

          Business done, so he thinks, Coriolanus crisply moves on.
          Cassius is not convinced.

<b>                         CASSIUS
</b>          But this is something odd.
          Coriolanus continues on. He sees a large JAMAICAN WOMAN with
          her CHILDREN, carrying plastic grocery bags, talking to a
          SHOPKEEPER. He goes to them:

          Coriolanus is warming to the task, it's easier than he

          growing alarm and resistance to Coriolanus:

</b>          He's not confirmed; we may deny him yet!

<b>                         TAMORA

<b>                         CASSIUS
</b>          I twice five hundred and their friends!
          The crowd roars approval. A frightening, animal sound.

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          Let them assemble,
          And on a safer judgment all revoke
          Your ignorant election.

<b>                         BRUTUS

          Cassius and Tamora lead the crowd. It is a terrifying
          spectacle of sudden mob rage, only a razor-thin edge to
          violence.
          Brutus and Sicinius watch, satisfied, like Robespierre and
          Saint Just looking over the bloody guillotine.

          crowd can be seen gathering. Police. Barricades.
          Sicinius and Brutus are waiting to intercept them.

          Coriolanus launches himself into the crowd with blistering

</b>          No more words, we beseech you--
          The mob has surrounded them all by now.
          The police are getting nervous, eyes darting uneasily from
          the unruly crowd to the volatile men.
          This all has the potential of sparking to violence.
          We note a TV news crew moving into position, covering the
          action. Others film with cell phone cameras. We intercut some
          of this footage.

<b>                         BRUTUS

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          It were well we let the people know it.

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          It is a mind

</b>          I'll give my reasons,

          Menenius tries to pull him away, Coriolanus shakes free and
          continues the attack:

          Neither supreme, how soon confusion,
          May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take

          The crowd roars angrily -- Coriolanus spins on them:

          Here's he that would take from you all
          your power!
          The crowd reacts angrily -- surging forward against the
          restraint of the police.
          We see grim RIOT POLICE marching into position. The crowd is
          not intimidated, they are spoiling for a fight.
          The Tribunes provoke the crowd even more, escalating and
          building the fever:

          Tamora, her face bloody from the riot, is with them. So too

          Unknown to the beginning.
          Sicinius is about to retort when Brutus stops him.
          Brutus assents, assuming the voice of reason:

<b>                         BRUTUS

          explain his plan.

          She pursues him:

</b>          Because that now it lies you on to speak
          To the people, not by your own

          Nor by the matter which your heart
          prompts you,
          But with such words that are but

</b>          Of no allowance to your bosom's truth...
          She moves closer to him. Her voice lower. A sort of
          seduction.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          I would dissemble with my nature where

          She is very close now. Whispering. She touches him gently,
          like a lover.

          A long beat. All are silent, watching her spin her web.

</b>          Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          This but done, even as she speaks,
          Why their hearts were yours.

          Although I know thou hadst rather
          Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
          Than flatter him in a bower.
          Coriolanus smiles. A genuinely sweet moment between them.
          Cominius enters with several other political supporters.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          Sir, it is fit
          You make strong party, or defend yourself
          By calmness or by absence. All's in
          anger.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Only fair speech.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          I think it will serve, if he
          Can thereto frame his spirit.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          He must -- and will.

<b>                         (TO CORIOLANUS)
</b>          Prithee now, say you will, and go about

          But he is still agitated. Volumnia shares a concerned glance
          with Menenius.

          It is as if he has been slapped. His resolve vanishes.

          He awaits her approval.

<b>          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY
</b>
          A crowded TV studio. The audience stands are filling up.
          Television cameras. Lights. Heavy security.
          On the stage: the set for a chat show. Translight of a city
          skyline behind the set. Two standing microphones.
          At the side of the set, Sicinius and Brutus are conspiring
          with the two citizen activists, Cassius and Tamora:

<b>                         BRUTUS
</b>
<b>                         (TO SICINIUS)

          Enforce him with his envy to the people.

</b>
<b>                         (TO TAMORA)

          Set down by the poll?

<b>                         TAMORA
</b>          I have; it's ready.

<b>                         SICINIUS
</b>          When the people hear me say "It shall be

</b>          In the right and strength of the

          For death, for fine, or banishment, then
          let them,

</b>          Cassius and Tamora hurry off to instruct and manipulate the
          crowd as best they can. They mix with the audience in the
          stands.

<b>                         MEANWHILE--
</b>          A gloomy but resolved Coriolanus walks with Cominius and
          Menenius between the tiers of audience, on the way to the
          set.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>
<b>                         ARM YOURSELF

          With accusations, as I hear, more strong
          Than are upon you yet.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          The word is "mildly." Pray you, let us
          go.
          Let them accuse me by invention, I
          Will answer in mine honor.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Ay, but mildly.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
          Coriolanus steels himself as they emerge from between the
          stands and head toward the set.
          TV news crews are waiting. Blinding lights snap on.
          The crowd, on seeing Coriolanus, lets out a ROAR. Deafening
          and savage.
          We see Cassius and Tamora moving through the crowd,
          instigating, convincing, imploring.
          Coriolanus ignores it all. Imperious to the end.
          Brutus and Sicinius wait on the set.

<b>                         BRUTUS
</b>          (whispers to Sicinius)
          Put him to choler straight.
          Coriolanus and his supporters move to the stage. Coriolanus
          glares at the Tribunes. The TV crews take up position.
          Menenius gestures for Coriolanus to step to the microphone,
          whispering to him:

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Calmly, I do beseech you.
          Coriolanus steps to the microphone.
          Brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down.
          We see bits of this scene through the monitors on the TV
          cameras.
          When the crowd is silent, Coriolanus begins to make a

<b>                         REHEARSED SPEECH:
</b>
<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          The honored gods--
          But his voice echoes badly with reverb. Menenius adjusts the
          microphone. Coriolanus begins again, quickly and by rote:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          The honored gods
          Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of

          Throng our large temples with the shows
          of peace,
          And not our streets with war.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          Amen, amen.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          A noble wish.
          His boilerplate speech over, Coriolanus turns to Sicinius who
          is at the other standing microphone:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Shall I be charged no further than this

          The TV cameras hum. The crowd is silent.

          Coriolanus slowly takes one last, long look at the people of

<b>          EXT. WASTELAND CHECKPOINT - DAWN
</b>
          The outskirts of Rome are an urban wasteland. Abandoned
          factories. Rusting cars. Overgrown vacant lots. Collapsing
          advertising billboards.
          There is a lonely gas station in the distance, its neon sign
          glowing a lurid green in the gray dawn light.
          We are at a Roman checkpoint on the highway into the city. A
          guardhouse and barrier. Some barbed wire barricades. Bored
          soldiers.
          Several cars pull up to the checkpoint. Two Roman security
          SUVs. Menenius' familiar limousine. And Volumnia's enormous
          Bentley.
          Security Guards climb out of their vehicle, light cigarettes
          and chat with the soldiers manning the checkpoint. Menenius,
          Titus and Cominius climb from Menenius' limousine.

<b>          INT. VOLUMNIA'S BENTLEY - DAWN

          Meanwhile, inside the Bentley, Coriolanus is comforting his
          wife and mother:

          surprisingly unsentimental and tough with her:

          Coriolanus takes his leave:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>
<b>                         (EMBRACING TITUS)

</b>          Cominius, droop not, adieu.
          I'll do well yet.
          He goes to Menenius, who is genuinely distraught. For all his
          political machinations, he truly cares for Coriolanus.
          Coriolanus is moved to see Menenius so emotional.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Thou old and true Menenius,
          Thy tears are salter than a younger

          I'd go with thee every foot.
          They embrace.
          Then Coriolanus knows it is time to go. He picks up a
          traveling bag and slings it over his shoulder.
          Looks back at his friends and family.
          A beat.
          A certain darkness creeps into his expression. An ominous
          resolve.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          You shall hear from me still.
          He turns and looks to the distance.
          Miles and miles of wasteland and desolation.

          He strides off.
          The soldiers manning the checkpoint raise the barrier.
          Coriolanus walks under it. And begins walking down the long
          highway away from Rome.
          The only sound is the cold, lonely moan of the wind.
          We fade to...

<b>          EXT./INT. EXILE SEQUENCE - DAY/NIGHT
</b>
          Coriolanus' exile.
          We see his long odyssey. It is a grueling physical journey --
          and also something of a spiritual challenge. He is solitary
          and without comfort: vulnerable to the elements and also to
          the demons of his own psyche.
          We see him as...
          He walks along the barren highway. Trash piled along the
          road. A car zooms past. Whoosh. He is lost in dust...
          Blazing heat, like a furnace, as he trudges over desert
          terrain. Burning oil wells blacken the sky in the distance...
          Isolated, within himself, as he walks past the detritus of
          war a burned out tank a mountain of rusted artillery
          shells skeletons bleached in the sun...
          His clothes are dusty and dirty now. A sandstorm. He wraps a
          scarf around his head, like a burnoose. Only his eyes visible
          now...
          A gypsy boy in tattered clothing riding a white horse passes
          him. The boy looks at him intently as he passes...
          We get a sense of him moving into different terrain, up into
          a mountain range, climbing...
          Then descending. Pouring rain. Lightning sparking. He is
          almost a Romantic figure now. Byronic. Wrapped in a cloak
          against the wildness of nature; the chiaroscuro flashes of
          light illuminating his haunted eyes...

<b>          EXT. OUTSIDE ANTIUM - NIGHT

          Coriolanus stands. Like a statue. All his life in his blazing
          eyes. He is staring at a small town in the distance.
          We see a sign: ANTIUM.
          His destination since he began. The home of his nemesis, the
          hated Aufidius.
          He begins to walk to the town.

          Meanwhile, back in Rome, Brutus and Sicinius are having lunch
          at their usual hangout.
          They see Volumnia entering the restaurant, pulling Virgilia
          after her. An ambush. She heads toward the Tribunes.
          Volumnia's eyes have the grim intensity of a predator. She

          Menenius gently restrains Volumnia and the Tribunes finally
          escape the bar.
          Volumnia takes a breath, controls herself.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Could I meet 'em

          sup with me?
          She turns to him. A cold and killing fire in her eyes.

</b>          Anger's my meat. I sup upon myself,

          She takes Virgilia's hand and drags her out.
          Menenius watches. Saddened.
          Once proud Volumnia, reduced to this.

<b>          EXT. ANTIUM - NIGHT
</b>
          Antium is an old Volscian city gone to seed. It is Latin in
          flavor, something like Havana.
          There is life to the place, a certain humid vitality. Someone
          is singing in a bar. Old men are playing dominos on a patio.
          Flickering TV and radio babel from terraced apartment
          buildings.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          74.
</b>          Coriolanus, his face still shrouded in the burnoose, like a
          Hamas soldier, moves through the streets.
          He takes in the life of the town as he walks. Studying the
          faces of the Volscians around him.
          Coriolanus sees a heavily-guarded apartment building at the
          end of the street. Jeeps and SOLDIERS.
          Coriolanus approaches with stealth, moving in and out of
          shadows along the street, ducking into doorways and alleys,
          taking advantage of the darkness.
          He stops. Steps into the shadows. For he sees...
          Aufidius.
          Walking with a few of his officers.
          Aufidius is beloved in Antium. He has an easy manner with the
          people. He stops and chats. Laughs with them. He dances for a
          moment with a little girl.
          Coriolanus watches from the shadows, his expression complex.
          There is real envy . Aufidius has such a comfortable way
          with the common people, he's natural, unaffected.
          Aufidius jokes with the little girl's parents for a moment
          and then moves on.
          Coriolanus watches Aufidius and his men go into an apartment
          building.
          He scans the building with the eye of a Special Forces
          soldier. He sees that the soldiers guarding the building are
          bored, it is perfunctory work.
          Two YOUNG WOMEN, perhaps hookers, move past the front of the
          building, flirting with the soldiers. The soldiers call and
          whistle to them, delighted.
          Coriolanus uses this distraction to slip into the shadows
          behind the soldiers and sneak into the building...

<b>          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
          Coriolanus moves again with stealth, heading toward what is
          clearly the center of the action: a noisy room on the second
          floor.
          The doorway is guarded by two serious GUARDS. These are not
          the bored soldiers out front, these are grim and intense
          warriors.

          He is like ice now.

<b>                         HE MOVES--
</b>          A steady stride--
          He walks right up to the Guards--
          Before they can even respond--
          He punches one HARD in the throat -- the Guard recoils,
          gasping for air--
          Simultaneously, Coriolanus SLAMS his other hand violently
          over the entire face of the second Guard -- grabbing his face
          firmly and SHOVING him back into the door--
          So hard that the door slams aside--
          And Coriolanus shoves the Guard into--

<b>          INT. AUFIDIUS' CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
          Aufidius is having dinner with some of his men, their wives
          and some children--
           The soldiers bolt up, upsetting the table, smashing dishes --
          pulling guns -- alarmed--
          As Coriolanus powers in, still holding the second Guard by

<b>                         THE FACE--
</b>          He flings the Guard aside--
          Aufidius and his men, all pointing weapons at Coriolanus, are
          stunned.
          A long beat.
          Coriolanus' face is still masked by the burnoose. Only his
          cold eyes are visible.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Whence comes thou? What wouldst thou? Thy
          name?
          Coriolanus does not respond.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          76.
</b>          Aufidius is growing uneasy. His men are tense, ready to open
          fire at any second.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Speak, man! What's thy name?

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
          And harsh in sound to thine.
          The other Guard from outside, and several other soldiers,
          rush in. Weapons drawn, surrounding Coriolanus.
          He doesn't move a muscle.
          Aufidius, intrigued by the stranger's courage, waves his men
          off.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Say, what's thy name?

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          I know thee not Thy name?
          Finally, Coriolanus removes his burnoose. His face is
          exposed. The Volscians are stunned.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS

          The Volscians look to Aufidius, very nervous, unsure how to
          proceed. Aufidius just stares back at Coriolanus, staggered.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Only that name remains.
          Aufidius doesn't understand. Coriolanus explains:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          The cruelty and envy of the people,

          Coriolanus dares to take a step toward Aufidius--
          The Volscians react. Guns are raised, fingers tight on
          triggers, an instant from opening fire--
          Coriolanus carefully holds out his arms. He's unarmed.
          Aufidius nods to his men. They hold their fire.
          Coriolanus slowly crosses the room toward Aufidius. Step by
          step. Their eyes are locked. Nothing else in the world
          exists.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS

          Dares not this, then I present
          My throat to thee and to thy ancient
          malice...
          Coriolanus stops right in front of Aufidius and slowly,
          carefully, undoes his collar. Exposing his naked throat.
          Bending back his head.
          Ready for execution.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS

          a fool,

          hate,
          And cannot live but to thy shame unless
          It be to do thee service.
          A long beat.
          Aufidius stares at Coriolanus.
          The Volscians watch, eyes wide, too tense to do anything now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          78.
</b>          Aufidius just continues to stare at Coriolanus.
          Eyes locked.
          Coriolanus blinks some sweat from his eyes. This tiny, human
          response sparks something in Aufidius.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          O Martius Martius
          Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded
          from my heart
          A root of ancient envy.
          He offers his hand.
          Coriolanus takes it. Aufidius continues to hold him by the
          hand, rather intensely, speaking low:

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Let me twine
          Mine arms about that body.
          He embraces Coriolanus.
          Aufidius' men finally relax. Weapons are lowered. Relieved
          glances exchanged.
          Some of the Volscians, though, are clearly suspicious of
          Coriolanus. They watch Aufidius and Coriolanus, concerned.
          Aufidius still can't quite believe his ancient enemy is now
          his newest ally.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS

          Bestride my threshold.
          Coriolanus glances to him, perhaps a little disturbed or
          embarrassed by the intensity of Aufidius' words.
          Aufidius steps away from him, gestures for Coriolanus to sit.

          Aufidius continues quietly, almost whispering:

</b>          Worthy Martius,

<b>          INT. SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Coriolanus sits, naked. He has finally washed off the layers
          of dirt from his journey.
          An old woman is using an electric razor to shave his head.
          Aufidius is standing in the doorway to the room. Watching.
          His eyes move over Coriolanus' body, adding up the scars and
          wounds.
          A pause.
          Then Aufidius goes to the old woman. Takes the razor from
          her. She goes.
          Aufidius continues to shave Coriolanus' head himself.
          It is a deeply personal act, even intimate Yet Aufidius
          employs the same methodical rhythms as when he was sharpening
          his knife at the opening of the story.

<b>          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-WAR ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          The Volscian military command center. Maps, recon photos and
          radio equipment. Stacks of grenade launchers and arms.
          Aufidius' CAPTAINS and AIDES wait alongside some bedraggled
          Volsce POLITICIANS in ill-fitting suits.
          Aufidius ushers Coriolanus in:

</b>          0, come, go in,
          And take our friendly senators by the
          hands.
          Coriolanus shakes hands with the politicians:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          You bless me, gods.
          Then Aufidius takes him to a huge military map laid out on a
          pool table. Rome and her territories. Strategic markers
          denote Roman forces and Volscian forces.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou

<b>                         WILT HAVE
</b>          The leading of thine own revenges, take
          The one half of my commission.
          The Volscian soldiers and politicos are shocked. Aufidius is
          giving Coriolanus command of half his forces!

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          And set down---

          Whether to knock against the gates of
          Rome,
          Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
          To fright them ere destroy.
          Aufidius looks at Coriolanus hard. There it is. The gauntlet
          is thrown down. Coriolanus will have to completely betray
          Rome: expose her military weaknesses, tell her secrets.
          For all his neurotic intensity, Aufidius is a shrewd man.
          Coriolanus nods and turns to the battle map, moving various
          markers around to show Rome's defensive positions.
          Aufidius watches him with Machiavellian calm.

          They are distracted when people begin talking loudly,
          alarmed, at the bar. They hush each other and watch the TV
          over the bar. Something has happened.
          On the TV: a SPECIAL REPORT. Breaking News. A scroll across

</b>
          Urban industrial wasteland. Old factories and abandoned
          warehouses. Broken asphalt. Smashed windows.
          The Volscians have set up camp here. On the decaying fringes
          of the city. We see military hardware. Guns. Missile
          launchers. Armored vehicles.
          Soldiers are cleaning weapons, cooking meals, sleeping,

<b>          84.
</b>          An incongruous sight...
          An old barber chair floats past. Moving across the blue sky.
          Carried overhead by a group of Volscian soldiers.
          But there is something different about these Volscian
          soldiers. They have altered their uniforms into something
          pagan and primitive. All have shaved heads. Many have face
          tattoos or wear striking war paint.
          It is like something from LORD OF THE FLIES.
          They set the barber chair down outside an abandoned factory.
          This shattered and abandoned factory is Coriolanus' domain.
          It is decorated with human skulls.
          The CAMP BARBER, a fat man in a greasy butcher's apron,
          begins to strop his razor.
          Hard core young soldiers line up to have their heads shaved.
          They are Coriolanus' ACOLYTES.
          There is no sign of Coriolanus himself.
          Aufidius and his LIEUTENANT stand on the fringes, disturbed
          by the strange cult of personality that has grown up around
          Coriolanus.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Do they still fly to Coriolanus?

<b>                         LIEUTENANT
</b>          I do not know what witchcraft's in him,

<b>                         WOULD
</b>          When first I did embrace him.
          They turn and walk to the building where Aufidius is

<b>                         QUARTERED:

<b>                         IT
</b>          By sovereignty of nature.
          Aufidius nods to the guards outside his quarters and enters
          with his Lieutenant...

<b>          INT. VOLSCIAN CAMP-AUFIDIUS' QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
          A shattered building. Old graffiti on the walls. Weapons.
          Maps. Aufidius' gear.
          Aufidius sits on his cot, deep in thought.
          He pulls a folded bit of paper from his pocket. Carefully and
          lovingly unfolds it. He has been carrying this paper for
          months.
          We realize it is the glossy magazine cover with the picture
          of Coriolanus that Aufidius tore out earlier.
          He gazes at the picture, his fingers smoothing the paper,
          tracing the contours of Coriolanus' face...

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Whether t'was pride,
          Whether defect of judgement,
          Or whether nature,
          Not to be other than one thing,
          Made him feared,
          So hated, and so banished.
          A beat as he studies the picture.
          His lieutenant watches him closely, disturbed by Aufidius'
          obsession with Coriolanus.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          So our virtues
          Lie in the interpretation of the time.
          He brings the picture closer, whispering now:

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          One fire drives out one fire; one nail,

<b>                         ONE NAIL;

<b>          INT. ROMAN WAR ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Rome is at war now, so the room is busy and tense. Maps and
          video footage chart the enemy's progress. Soldiers confer
          urgently outside the door.
          Menenius stands with the two Tribunes, Brutus and Sicinius.
          With them are several SENATORS and GENERALS.
          Menenius snaps angrily:

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          No, I'll not go!

<b>                         SICINIUS

<b>                         KNEE
</b>          The way into his mercy.
          They stop when Titus enters with General Cominius.
          Titus is dusty, has just come from somewhere. He is pale.
          Truly shaken.
          Menenius and the others crowd around him, waiting for his
          report.
          Titus sits, takes a moment to pull himself together, and then
          reports with the grim severity of a death sentence:

<b>                         TITUS
</b>          He would not seem to know me.
          A beat.

          He would not answer to, forbade all
          names...
          A long beat. They wait for him to go on.
          Titus searches for the words to continue.

          He has no more to say, his head drops.
          Menenius begins to leave the room. The Tribunes stop him,
          leading him to a secluded corner:

<b>                         SICINIUS

          The Tribunes are relieved. Cominius nods and escorts Menenius
          out.
          Brutus and Sicinius return to Titus.

<b>          EXT. CHECKPOINT-HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
          The Roman checkpoint on the desolate highway. A formidable
          military presence here now: soldiers, heavy weapons, tanks.
          Volscian troops and a jeep can be seen down the highway.
          We see Menenius' limousine pull up.
          He and General Cominius climb out. Menenius is out of place
          in his trim business suit: a politician among soldiers.
          Menenius steels himself then passes through the Roman
          checkpoint.
          He walks down the highway toward the distant Volscian troops.

<b>          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - DAY

          Menenius is blindfolded, roughly pulled by two Volscian
          soldiers.
          We hear some of the soldiers hooting at him. We stay close on
          Menenius' blindfolded face, sharing his feeling of
          disorientation and suspense.

          He sits in the barber chair. His head is completely shaved.
          His face is marked with martial face painting. These striking
          totemic markings also cover his scarred body.
          He is primitive. Inhuman. Like a dragon.
          The Angel of Death.
          His young warrior Acolytes -- similarly shaved and painted --
          are gathered around him; his personal bodyguard and cult.
          A long beat as Menenius stares at his friend, stunned at the
          pagan metamorphosis.
          Coriolanus just gazes back at him.
          Menenius finally pulls himself together and approaches, with

<b>                         FULSOME BRAVADO:
</b>
<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          The glorious gods sit in hourly synod
          about thy particular prosperity, and love
          thee no worse than thy old friend
          Menenius does! 0 Martius, Martius!
          He steps forward to hug Coriolanus. Two of the Acolytes stop
          him. He can approach no further.
          Menenius accepts this. No matter. He is completely confident
          he will be able to manipulate his protege. He always has in
          the past.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          Thou art preparing fire for us. Look
          thee, here's water to quench it. I was
          hardly moved to come to thee, but being
          assured none but myself could move
          thee, I have been blown out of your gates
          with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon
          Rome.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          90.
</b>          A long beat.
          Menenius waits for an answer. Grows uneasy.
          Then...

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Away.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          How? . Away?

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>

<b>                         MY AFFAIRS
</b>          Are servanted to others.
          Menenius can't believe this cold response--

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>
<b>                         SIR--
</b>
<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Therefore be gone.
          His frigid eyes slice into Menenius:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Another word, Menenius,
          I will not hear thee speak.
          Menenius stares at him, shaken to the core.
          The Guards pull Menenius away.
          Coriolanus doesn't even glance at him.

<b>          EXT. CHECKPOINT-HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
          Back at the Roman checkpoint, Menenius strides toward his
          limousine. He has been deeply shaken by his interaction with
          the transformed Coriolanus.
          General Cominius follows urgently, Menenius doesn't stop:

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
          He has wings; he's more than a creeping
          thing.
          He stops at his limo.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          91.
</b>          A beat.
          He turns back to Cominius. We see the pain in Menenius' eyes.

<b>                         MENENIUS
</b>          There is no more mercy in him than there
          is milk in a male tiger.
          He climbs into his limo. Shuts the door.
          The limousine drives off, sending up a cloud of dust that
          swirls around Cominius.

<b>          INT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY
</b>
          Menenius sits in the back of his limo as it speeds back to
          Rome.
          The rejection by Coriolanus has wounded him. Also he is
          plagued by guilt. He helped create this monster. He pushed
          Coriolanus into politics. And now Coriolanus has lost his
          soul, even his humanity, and Rome is to be put to the sword.
          All his fault.
          This preys on him.

<b>          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY
</b>
          Menenius' limousine pulls over by an isolated set of railroad
          tracks. Weeds springing up. Battered advertising posters. An
          old chain link fence.
          Menenius climbs out of the car and walks along the tracks.
          Thinking.
          He stops.
          He sits on the railroad tracks.
          Pulls out a little pocket knife and, in the Roman fashion,
          efficiently slits his wrists.
          He stares out over the hideous landscape.
          Blood begins to pool around his stylish shoes.
          From afar we see him, sitting on the railroad tracks, alone
          and forlorn in this surreal urban wasteland, like a Samuel
          Beckett character.
          He slumps over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          92.
</b>          Menenius is dead.

<b>          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - SUNSET
</b>
          The red glow of dusk is shining through the cracked and dusty
          windows.
          Coriolanus, still in the barber chair, broods silently.
          Aufidius sits nearby, watching him.
          The visit from Menenius is troubling Coriolanus.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          My partner in this action,
          You must report to the Volscian lords how

<b>                         PLAINLY
</b>          I have borne this business.
          Aufidius is curiously formal in his response, the
          estrangement he feels toward Coriolanus growing:

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Only their ends
          You have respected; stopped your ears

<b>                         AGAINST
</b>          The general suit of Rome; never admitted
          A private whisper, no, not with such

<b>                         FRIENDS
</b>          That thought them sure of you.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          This last old man,
          Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to
          Rome,
          Loved me above the measure of a father.
          Shouts and whistles from outside the factory draw their
          attention.

<b>          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - SUNSET
</b>
          Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius stride past the soldiers
          and mountains of military hardware. Volumnia leads, pulling
          the others by the hand.
          Some of the soldiers whistle. Some spit. Others laugh and
          make lascivious noises. Many just watch with grim dislike.
          Volumnia appears to be completely impervious to the whistles
          and cruel taunts. Her head is high, back straight, eagle eye
          forward. She was never more a Roman patrician.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          93.
</b>          She is magnificent.

<b>          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - SUNSET
</b>
          Coriolanus stands as Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius are
          led into the factory.
          He tries to register nothing, assuming a sort of glacial
          calm.
          Volumnia and the others stop -- taking in Coriolanus' savage
          new demeanor and appearance -- taking in the Acolytes and
          pagan totems.
          Volumnia just stands, peering sternly at her son. As if
          daring him not to crumble before her. He doesn't.
          Aufidius watches everything closely.
          It is Virgilia, finally, who bravely approaches:

<b>                         VIRGILIA
</b>          My lord and husband--
          He stop her, almost a warning, with:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          These eyes are not the same I wore in
          Rome.

<b>                         VIRGILIA
</b>          The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
          Makes you think so.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Best of my flesh,
          Forgive my tyranny, but do not say
          For that "Forgive our Romans."
          She shows great courage. Stepping forward and kissing him
          deeply. A long kiss.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          0, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as
          my revenge.
          It is a perverse response. In his monomaniacal imagination,
          his wife's kiss is obsessively equated with his revenge on
          Rome.
          He finally moves to Volumnia, simply can't resist her orbital
          pull.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          94.
</b>
<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          You gods I prate,
           And the most noble mother of the world
           Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, in the
          earth.
           He kneels before her. It is done with a sense of duty and
          protocol, not affection.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          0, stand up blest.
          He rises.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Then with no softer cushion than the

<b>                         FLINT
</b>          I kneel before thee.
           She quickly and dramatically kneels before him. It is a coup
          de theatre and a masterpiece of manipulation.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          What is this?
          Your knees to me? To your corrected son?

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Thou art my warrior;
          I hope to frame thee.
          She indicates Young Martius:

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          This is a poor epitome of yours,
          Which by the interpretation of full time
          May show like all yourself.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          (to his son)
          The god of soldiers,
          Inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that
          thou may prove
          To shame invulnerable.
          Volumnia pulls Young Martius down:

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Your knee, sir.
          She pulls Virgilia down:

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Even he, your wife, and myself,
          Are suitors to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          95.
</b>          All three kneel before Coriolanus. A pitiable sight. But he
          has no pity.
          He turns, sits in the barber chair.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          I beseech you, peace!
          Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
          Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or

<b>                         CAPITULATE
</b>          Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not
          Wherein I seem unnatural. Desire not
          To ally my rages and revenges with

          Volumnia stands, assuming again a position of strength.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          0, no more, no more!

</b>          Coriolanus' face is a study in aloof neutrality. Yet he is
          listening intensely and Volumnia's words are affecting.
          She fights back emotion. It is impossible to tell if this
          real or feigned.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA

          Young Martius stands as well and approaches his father,

          Coriolanus stares at him -- the intensity of the boy's
          aggression is disturbing. And familiar.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS

          Coriolanus does not respond.
          She softens...

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Speak to me, son...
          Still he does not respond.
          His emotions are roiling.
          Still she is soft and vulnerable...

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Why dost not speak?
          But softness is not a note she plays naturally. She knows it.
          Her natural aggressiveness comes out, anger and outrage
          gradually boiling to the surface:

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Thinks thou it honorable for a noble man
          Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak
          you.
          He cares not for your weeping. Speak
          thou, boy.
          Perhaps thy childishness will move him

          She is assaulting him now, on the attack:

          Coriolanus can take no more, turns and begins to walk away--
          Volumnia reacts like lightning -- grabbing Virgilia and Young
          Martius and dragging them to the dirt with her--

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Down! Let us shame him with our knees!
          She claws at the dirt -- like Hecuba -- keening -- a shocking
          explosion of raw emotion -- almost an incantation:

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Down! An end! This is the last. So we

          She remains kneeling, panting for air.
          Coriolanus looks at her. His noble mother. Clawing in the
          dirt like an animal. Filthy. Despairing. Her face wet with
          tears.
          She looks back up at him. She senses she has failed.
          It's over.

<b>                         VOLUMNIA
</b>          Come, let us go.
          She rises slowly, her age showing. Her spirit broken. Or
          seeming so.
          She stares at Coriolanus as she rips off the Roman Eagle
          medal she wears and flings it to the ground.
          The blood red sky of sunset behind her reflects her passion
          as she summons up all her strength for a lacerating and icy

          She turns and begins to go.
          But...
          We see finally Coriolanus crack.
          Like a great building crumbling.
          Like fissures cutting across marble.
          Emotion floods into him.
          He lunges forward and grabs her hand. Volumnia stops.
          Time stands still.
          He doesn't speak.

<b>                         THEN:
</b>

          What have you done?
          He falls to his knees, clutching her hand.

          He buries his head in her, like a lost child:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>           O my mother, mother! 0!
           You have won a happy victory for Rome;
           But for your son - believe it, 0 believe

<b>                         DEEPLY)
</b>          If not most mortal to him.
          She looks down at him. His meaning, his foreshadowing, is
          clear: she has saved Rome, but he knows he is doomed. Rome
          will live. He will die. This is the price for her victory
          today.

          A moment between them.
          He accepts his destiny.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          But let it come.
          He stands, regains his composure. He slowly walks to
          Aufidius.
          He leans close, speaking intimately:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
          I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good
          Aufidius,
          Were you in my stead, would you have

<b>                         HEARD

          Aufidius?

</b>
<b>                         (CAREFULLY)

          And, sir, it is no little thing to make
          Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good
          sir,
          What peace you'll make, advise me.
          We study Aufidius' face. He gives away nothing.
          Coriolanus turns back to Volumnia. Looks at her.
          She is victorious.
          The crimson sky looms over her ominously.
          And we go to...

<b>          INT. FORMAL MINISTRY HALL - DAY
</b>
          A solemn peace treaty signing ceremony.
          Coriolanus represents the Volscians. Cominius represents the
          Romans. They sit side-by-side at desks signing the treaty.
          Volumnia and Virgilia, gorgeously dressed, are present. So
          too Brutus and Sicinius. The press films everything.

</b>          It has the stiff formality of a White House ceremony.
          Cominius concludes signing:

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
          No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
          We have all
          Great cause to give great thanks.
          He looks to Volumnia.

<b>                         COMINIUS
</b>          Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
          She is erect and exalted. "The Life of Rome" personified.
          She ignores her son.
          Coriolanus will not look at her.

<b>          EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
</b>
           A rundown Truck Stop in an industrial wasteland.
          Garish, buzzing neon. Filthy 18-wheelers refueling. Music
          droning from a radio.
          Aufidius, his Lieutenant and seven of his men are waiting
          outside the dusty diner.
          The men with Aufidius are thugs and killers, the most brutal
          Volsces he could find. We note a couple of Coriolanus'
          Acolytes among them. They have turned with great venom on
          their hero.
          They are like a mafia hit squad, waiting for Coriolanus to
          return with the peace treaty.
          Aufidius is deep in thought.
          His Lieutenant breaks the silence:

<b>                         LIEUTENANT
</b>          How is it with our general?

</b>          I know it,
          And my pretext to strike at him admits
          A good construction.
          A beat. He continues more to himself than them, almost
          convincing himself.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          I raised him, and I pawned
          Mine honor for his truth; who being so
          heightened,
          He watered his new plants with dews of
          flattery,
          Seducing so my friends.

<b>                         (BITTERLY)
</b>          At the last
          I seemed his follower, not partner, and
          He waged me with his countenance as if
          I had been mercenary.

<b>                         LIEUTENANT
</b>          So he did, my lord.

</b>          For no less spoil than glory--
          Aufidius works himself into an intense, neurotic rage:

</b>          There was it!
          For which my sinews shall be stretched
          upon him.
          At a few drops of women's rheum, which

</b>          As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and

</b>          Therefore, at your vantage,
          Ere he express himself or move the people
          With what he would say, let him feel your
          sword,
          Which we will second.

          In the distance they can see a Roman military truck
          approaching. Clouds of dust billow up.
          They exchange a look. This is what they have been waiting
          for. They stand, stretch and prepare.
          The truck stops across the highway from them and Coriolanus
          gets out. He holds a copy of the peace treaty in a leather
          portfolio. He is unarmed.
          He stops.
          He sees Aufidius and the thugs. Waiting for him. Like a death
          squad.
          Coriolanus looks at them.
          He knows exactly what's going to happen.
          He is ready.
          He nods and the truck drives off.
          Coriolanus slowly crosses the highway to the truck stop, like
          a gunslinger walking down Main Street.
          There is something new to Coriolanus here. A sort of
          acceptance. He knows his time is past.
          Aufidius and the thugs go to meet him. The thugs spread out a
          bit, strategically, getting ready to strike. Coriolanus'
          experienced eyes miss none of this.
          They meet in the parking lot.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS

          He hands the treaty portfolio to Aufidius:

</b>          We have made peace

          Than shame to the Romans.

</b>          He hath abused your powers.
          Coriolanus is ready for Aufidius' ploy. He is amused at the
          obvious attempt to anger him:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Traitor? How now?

<b>                         AUFIDIUS

          He spins to the others, making the case against Coriolanus
          with cutting bitterness:

</b>          Measureless liar, thou has made my heart
          Too great for what contains it. "Boy"? 0
          slave.
          Coriolanus' eyes miss nothing a Volscian thug shifting
          a bead of sweat on another one secretly reaching into
          his coat for a weapon.
          Some of the Volscian thugs are clearly nervous.
          Coriolanus is ready. He prepares himself mentally to die. He
          is acutely controlled:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Cut me to pieces, Volsces.
          Men and lads, stain all your edges on me.
          It is a dare. A challenge.

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          "Boy"? False hound.
          If you have writ your annals true, 'tis

<b>                         THERE
</b>          That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I
          Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
          His gaze burns into Aufidius:

<b>                         CORIOLANUS
</b>          Alone I did it "Boy."

<b>                         AUFIDIUS
</b>          Let him die for it.
          At this command, his men move--
          Aufidius steps back as--
          The Volscian thugs attack--
          With knives, machetes and tire irons--
          Coriolanus fights bravely -- disarming two, grabbing their
          weapons, killing them, fighting back--
          Slashing and cutting his way through the killers-
          Closer and closer to Aufidius, who just watches--
          Blood spattering and spraying-
          But the thugs overpower Coriolanus, there are just too many--

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          106.
</b>          They stab him -- slicing with knives -- battering with chains
          and clubs -- finally emptying pistols him into him--
          It is graceless and brutal carnage.
          Slaughter.
          But still he comes on. Body riddled with bullets and cut to
          bits. He refuses to fall. Like something immortal. An obscene
          demon of blood.
          Finally the thugs move away.
          Coriolanus still stands. Teetering. His face is a swollen
          mask of blood and gore. Blood flows from his body, pooling
          around his feet, spreading across the parking lot.
          Aufidius steps forward.
          What is left of Coriolanus glares at him through blood.
          Aufidius slowly pulls his knife. The same knife he was
          sharpening so carefully at the opening of the story. It has
          finally found its purpose.
          Coriolanus looks at him.
          Then slowly Coriolanus tries to raise one bleeding arm
          this requires superhuman effort his slashed fingers
          clutch his shirt he rips it open exposing his breast.
          Ready.
          He locks eyes with Aufidius.
          Aufidius steps to him. Takes his neck. Pulls him onto the
          knife. Driving it into him. Cradling his head like a lover.
          They stand like this.
          Then Coriolanus falls.
          A pause.

<b>                         AUFIDIUS

          No one moves.

          Coriolanus' body is awkwardly tossed into the back of an open
          truck. Like a sack of potatoes.

<b>          EXT. TRUCK - SUNSET
</b>
          A crowd of Volscians are gathered around the back of the
          truck. They have come to see Coriolanus' body.
          We watch their faces. Normal people. A range of grim emotion.
          One raises a cell phone. Takes a photo.
          More phone cameras come out. Streaming video. Recording the
          moment.

          On the TV:
          The footage from the cell phone video.
          Coriolanus' body in the back of the trunk.

          Volumnia stands.

          Looking at her son.

          His body sprawled ungainly in death.

          No ritual or ceremony. No honor.

          Her face.

          Snap to black.

          The End.
