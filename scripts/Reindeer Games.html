<b>               FIGURE IN A SANTA CLAUS SUIT
</b>
               lies face-down in a nighttime expanse of snow. One of the 
               body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The 
               white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red.

<b>               REVEAL EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
               The figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               Dark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling 
               winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead 
               in the doorway.

               It's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes. 
               His face is missing.

<b>               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
               More snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third 
               BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of 
               an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed 
               through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.

               A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang 
               off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent.

<b>               INT. ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               A floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of 
               neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool. 
               The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now.

<b>               EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT
</b>
               where the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine, 
               which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously 
               atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.

               His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face, 
               late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN.

               He opens his eyes.

<b>               THE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND

               rises, as a TITLE appears: "SEVEN DAYS BEFORE..."

<b>               EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN STATE PRISON - DAY
</b>
               Snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the 
               Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile.

<b>               INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
</b>
               Rudy Duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling -- 
               where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.

               The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo 
               through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across 
               the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.

               He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage 
               self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family 
               photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful 
               Dodger.

<b>               A WALL CALENDAR
</b>
               Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.

               December 22nd is circled again and again.

               Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops 
               to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. 
               Turning back to the beds we reveal --

<b>               THE LOWER BUNK
</b>
               where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached 
               and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is 
               a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost 
               a mural.

               All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, 
               smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous 
               brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.

<b>               RUDY
</b>
               stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, 
               turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen 
               this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

<b>               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

               The two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick 
               absently whistles some "Silver Bells," then digs for a smoke.

                         Christmas on the outs.

               Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet, 
               hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his 
               cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.

               Nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the 
               prison's entrance road. Longingly.

                         those room service steaks... anything

               Nick grins. They stand there, shivering. It's freezing, but 
               the time they get outside is too precious to give up.

                         her, Nick? You hear sometimes they 
                         don't send their real pictures. Could 
                         be her cousin or something.

               Nick studies him.

               They trail off in silence. Nick looks out at the prison road 
               again. A snowy wasteland.

               Nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig, 
               reading sheets of pink stationery. With a new photo: of the 
               same GIRL, in a bikini by a lake. Vamping a childish pose.

               Nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling 
               at the latest letter.

               among his collage of pictures. Admiring his pen pal:

               Above, Rudy peruses the page Nick gave him. Some lipstick 
               marks pressed to the paper. He passes it back, closes his 
               eyes.

               GUARDS monitor PRISONERS as they file out of their cells for 
               the afternoon meal. Rudy and Nick are motioned out by a MEAN 
               GUARD, his bitter world etched in his face. They join the 
               line.

</b>                         Shit. Alamo's back.

               Across Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed 
               Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands 
               are the size of a man's skull.

               At that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy 
               swiftly looks away --

               The mean guard pulls his blackjack. Another guard's ready 
               behind him. They want Rudy to give them trouble.

               Rudy stops. Slides back into the line of prisoners. Looks 
               across Broadway. The Alamo's walked on up ahead. Rudy 
               swallows, heads toward the mess hall.

               A GLOOPY SPOON of CHUNKY RED AND GREEN JELLO gets splooshed 
               on Rudy's plate. Same with Nick. It's the cafeteria line.

               The ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. Nick 
               looks to Rudy, then turns back to the help:

               The ugly staffer curls his lip. Nick smiles. Rudy moves on, 
               taking his tray off the rail and turning --

               -- right into the chest of The Alamo. He looks up -- into 
               the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to 
               see. The Alamo's a lifer. Many times over.

               The Alamo strides into the cafeteria line. Rudy finally takes 
               a breath, as if he's dodged death. Nick's at his shoulder. 
               They share a grave and worried look. Trying to help:

               Rudy and Nick sit at a cafeteria table. Beside Rudy is a 
               frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, ZOOK. Zook sits alone, talks 
               to no one, always has the shakes.

               Rudy shrugs. He checks across the room, on the whereabouts 
               of The Alamo. The big Indian has his back turned.

               And Rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. A trio of GUARDS 
               descend, grabbing Nick's body as his life fades away. Dragging 
               his figure out of the melee. WHISTLES are blowing.

</b>
               Rudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the 
               skull for his trouble. He hits the jello-covered floor.

               And the world goes dark.

<b>               INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT
</b>
               Darkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his 
               head. The cell block silent for the first time.

               Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's 
               somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with 
               distinct pleasure.

<b>                                     RUDY

</b>                         Well. Least he won't be coming back.

               The guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him --

               -- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing 
               through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps 
               the cruel smile.

<b>                                     MEAN GUARD

                         you just give a holler.

               He puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling "Are You 
               Lonesome Tonight?" Several shadowed VOICES request that he 
               shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the 
               row.

<b>               RUDY
</b>
               turns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on 
               Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind.

<b>               THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY
</b>
               Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the 
               photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall.

<b>               RUDY
</b>
               takes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of 
               it.

               Rudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters.

               He trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages. 
               He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it.

<b>                                     NICK (V.O.)
</b>                         Rudy, man, here we go, here, what 
                         she wrote here: "The car's waiting. 
                         The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting.  
                         I've waited for so long. I'm burning

                         whole heart. I'm burning for you..."

               Rudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a 
               swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly.

               And puts the letter away.

</b>
<b>               EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY
</b>
               Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door 
               BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS, 
               make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered 
               in snow.

<b>                                     EXIT GUARD
</b>                         Your world and welcome to it, 
                         dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now! 
                         We'll keep the lights on for ya!

               Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill 
               hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in 
               summer.

               Secondhand shoes. No possessions.

               He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All 
               fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the 
               fenceway.

<b>               BEYOND THE GATE
</b>
               There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, 
               several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats 
               and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.

               The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks 
               the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.

               The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives 
               rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade 
               slaps on backs. Reunion time.

               The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head 
               down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he 
               can't help himself -- he glances up --

<b>               TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN
</b>
               bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball 
               on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners.

<b>               RUDY
</b>
               drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus.

<b>               INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Rudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes 
               a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. 
               Then the cons with relatives start to pile in.

               Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into 
               his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the 
               picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it.

               He rubs his window with his sleeve.

               Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and 
               that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing 
               onto the bus with their loved ones.

               The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the 
               gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming.

               Rudy watches her sadly.

               Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up 
               their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, 
               buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's 
               changed.

               The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball.

               Rudy looks at the bikini picture again.

               Then at the shivering bundle.

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         Don't do it, Rudy...

               The bus ENGINE starts up. In the seat beside Rudy, an EX-CON 
               makes out with his WIFE while his bratty KID punches his 
               leg.

               Out the window, the young woman is scanning the bus windows. 
               Then the prison again. She turns in a worried circle. Rudy 
               looks swiftly away. Closes his eyes.

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         Don't do it ...

               The bus door closes. It REVS and starts forward. Rudy sighs 
               with relief. The photo of Ashley falls to the floor.

<b>               EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               The young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy 
               road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.

               The door opens. And Rudy steps out.

               The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter.

               The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We 
               get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips 
               turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's 
               Ashley.

               She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow 
               obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them 
               shivering. Both of them standing there.

               And finally:

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         You Ashley?

               Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles.

</b>
<b>               INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
</b>
               Rudy and Ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. Coats still on. 
               Big rigs bluster by on the highway outside.

               Two untouched cups of coffee sit before them.

               She's watching him in silence.

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         I like your coat.

               Ashley says nothing. Rudy looks at his own:

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         This -- this is just something they 
                         gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing 
                         when we signed up, y'know?

               Ashley nods.

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         How's your coffee?

               Ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there. 
               She lifts the cup, takes a sip. Puts it down.

<b>                                     ASHLEY

               Rudy nods. Silence again.

                         they meant.

               Ashley nods. Rudy bites his lip.

                         maybe it's not the same as your

               Rudy goes silent. Whoa. Ashley considers.

               Another awkward pause. Rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside 
               the coffee, puts it to his lips. It gives him a wide white 
               mustache. He stares straight-faced.

               Ashley gives a bashful smile, covers it.

               It comes out too harsh. Ashley stops, a little hurt.

               Rudy softens, touches her arms:

                         want to see me.

               He kisses her. She nods, dismisses it, kisses back.

               Ashley's Chevy Nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside 
               joint. There's an artificial (silver) Christmas tree tied to 
               the roof.

               She and Rudy climb out; she heads for the office:

                         I get back in that room, you better

</b>                         No, lover. I'll see what you can do.

               She smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring 
               his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their 
               shopping score. Gifts and goodies.

                         pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...

               Loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags 
               on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside.

<b>               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Pitch dark. Rudy fumbles his way in:

</b>                         Hi, Nick.

               Rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky 
               black shadow, MERLIN, all 280 pounds of him, KICKS the door 
               shut --

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         What the fuck --

               -- and SWINGS a baseball bat toward Rudy's chest. Rudy gets 
               an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a 
               mother. Rudy HOWLS. Merlin comes at him again --

               -- and this time Rudy slips by. Merlin's bat SHATTERS a 
               dresser.

               Rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests 
               him to the ground. Grabs the bat --

               -- and gets DECKED from behind by another shadow, PUG, a 
               little white guy with a snarl. They go CRASHING onto the 
               bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor --

               -- where Rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries 
               and BASHES it backwards, shattering it over Pug's head!

               Pug lets go, as Rudy scrambles up, and Merlin's got him again 
               in a bear hug. Rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing 
               into one wall, then another, YELLING for help --

<b>                                     RUDY

</b>
               -- until he hears the PUMP-LOAD SNAP of a shotgun.

               Rudy stops still. A lamp clicks on.

               Standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a 
               sawed-off on him.

<b>                                     GABRIEL
</b>                         Welcome home, Nick.

               Another lamp comes on. Rudy, still in Merlin's choke-hold, 
               gets a look at the gunman, GABRIEL. Weathered face, stringy 
               hair, early 30's. Handsome in a scuzzy way. He's seen a lot 
               of road.

               Rudy stares, totally thrown. Pug, the little guy, bad teeth, 
               bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne.

<b>                                     PUG
</b>                         I owe ya a drink, ya fuck --

               -- and slugs Rudy in the gut. Merlin yanks him back up. 
               Merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. 
               Behind Merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced Indian 
               in a Grateful Dead longsleeve. JUMPY. Guarding the door.

               Gabriel's studying Rudy, up and down. Nods. Merlin relaxes 
               his choke-hold so Rudy can breathe.

               As the room's door gets kicked open --

               and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting 
               forced through with Ashley's grunts and groans --

               Merlin traps his jaw shut. The tree comes squeezing through, 
               followed by Ashley, face in branches --

<b>                                     ASHLEY

                         people want their houses smelling 
                         like the stupid woods...

               She's GRABBED from behind by Jumpy. Ashley screams, but he 
               slams her against the wall. The tree hits the ground.

               Rudy fights to help her, but Merlin's got him. Pug locks 
               Ashley's arms. She fights, muffled cries, but Jumpy and Pug 
               have her held firmly. Her face to the wall --

                         her taste in Christmas.

               Rudy's jaw drops. He looks to Ashley. Then to Gabriel.

               Ashley YELLS, enraged, kicking and clawing. Jumpy slams her 
               back against the wall for her trouble --

               Gabriel raises the sawed-off to Rudy's chest. Rudy flinches,

               Gabriel looks from her to him, then lowers his sawed-off,

               Gabriel RATCHETS him across the chin with the gun butt. Rudy 
               hits the floor. Gabriel spins on Ashley, enraged:

               Gabriel puts the gun to Rudy's head.

               Gabriel KICKS Rudy in the jaw. Ashley screams. Gabriel motions 
               to his boys: Jumpy and Pug drag her outside. Gabriel KICKS 
               Rudy again. Rudy lies there and takes it.

               Merlin lights a cig, examines Rudy and Ashley's grocery bags:

               Merlin nods, tucks the bags under his arms, leaves the room.

               Gabriel drops beside Rudy, with a sick smile:

               As we SWOOP DOWN onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway, 
               arcing into the blackness.

               CLOSING ON an 18-wheel tractor trailer, RUMBLING onward, 
               emblazoned with "Great Lakes Trucking." There's an airbrush 
               painting on the door to the cab, of a skeleton looking thru 
               a flaming radial tire, and the legend "Motor City Monster."

               Gabriel at the wheel, Merlin smoking, Jumpy eating cookies. 
               A TRUCK passes; Gabriel waves. A moment later, the CB

               eyes closed, dried blood, head rocking side to side. He 
               winces, waking, with the headache to end all headaches.

               Her hand strokes his face. Rudy's eyes struggle open.

<b>               ON FULL SCENE
</b>
               They're in the back of the truck. There's some packing mats, 
               rope, two tall storage lockers, and Ashley's Chevy Nova.

               Rudy's head is in her lap. He struggles to sit up, finds his 
               wrists tied with cord. He looks at Ashley, follows her gaze.

               In a corner, Pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. He's dipping 
               chewing tobacco, reading Road & Track, headphones on. Gives 
               Rudy a bored glance, then back to his magazine.

               Ashley nods. Rudy looks around, remembering.

               From the corner, Pug spits some chaw. Ashley wheels.

               Pug doesn't even look up. Still stroking Rudy's face:

               She reaches out for him; Rudy scrambles to his knees, tumbles 
               against the opposite wall of the trailer.

               Ashley runs at him, wraps her arms around him tightly. He 
               tries to fight her off. She won't let go.

               Rudy stops fighting. She has a terrified look in her eye. 
               Checks to Pug: he's watching them now, chewing slower. Ashley 
               turns them away from the little guy's view

               The truck shudders through downshifts, to a groaning stop. 
               Ashley embraces Rudy fiercely, holding on for the last.

               The trailer gate RATTLES open into the truck's roof.

                         watch for people stealing chips, 
                         counting cards, getting piss-drunk, 
                         that kinda shit. Indian place, they 
                         hired this reject outta Vegas to run 
                         it, got about as much business sense 
                         as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a 
                         fun place to run some numbers and 
                         play."

               Gabriel puts the letter down.

                         Nick...

               Rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward:

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         That's the guy I was in with, I did 
                         my last ten months with him. He rode 
                         a two-year bit for manslaughter -- 
                         split a guy's skull open at a bar 
                         for harassing his girl. That's Nick 
                         Mason. He worked at that casino. 
                         He's the one who wrote her letters.  
                         Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job 
                         was a Quickie Lube, I did five for 
                         lifting cars. I don't know shit about 
                         blackjack, I don't know shit about 
                         Indians. I'm not him.

               Gabriel stares at him. Then crumples the letter.

</b>                         Bury this guy.

               Merlin and Jumpy grab Rudy and THROW him from the truck. He 
               HITS the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound.

<b>                                     ASHLEY

                         we'd be gone! When he helped us!  
                         Loverboy don't want to play!

               Merlin and Jumpy drop to the snow, picking Rudy up.

<b>                                     ASHLEY

                         sweetheart to help!

               Rudy meets eyes with Ashley. She's caught.

<b>                                     GABRIEL
</b>                         He'd rather die than be with you, 
                         he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend 
                         anyway.
                              (to Merlin/Jumpy)
                         Bury him all over the place.

</b>
               She charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her 
               into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out 
               of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock.

               Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark 
               and snowy woods ahead...

<b>                                     MERLIN
</b>                         Beats prison, I guess.

</b><b>                         NICK!!! NICK!!! NOOOOO!!!
</b>
               Rudy struggles, desperate but held firm. Jumpy loads a 
               handgun, as he muses for the very first time:

<b>                                     JUMPY
</b>                         The problem with prison... is that 
                         it is founded on the fundamentally 
                         flawed perception of rehabilitation 
                         through punishment. A society can't 
                         hope to create a "changed man" by 
                         surrounding him with the worst in 
                         his fellow man; what it 
                         "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction 
                         that if he can survive the inhumanity 
                         of prison, what then, can he not 
                         withstand? He has seen man's darkest 
                         soul and kept his sight: what is 
                         left for such a man? What faith? 
                         What fear?

               At the woods' edge, Jumpy gives the gun to Merlin --

<b>                                     JUMPY
</b>                         Don't get no blood on my boots --

               The gun goes to Rudy's head. A bullet fills the chamber. 
               Ashley SCREAMS. Rudy shuts his eyes tight and --

</b><b>                         WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW!

               Merlin and Jumpy stop. Ashley stops screaming. Gabriel turns.

<b>                                     RUDY

                         you want to know!

               His guards look to Gabriel. Rudy nods, sweating.

                         Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want 
                         me, you got me. Whaddya want to know.

               Ashley gasps relief. Gabriel smiles.

               Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy back. Still on the ground:

               Rudy won't meet her eyes.

                         something.

               Rudy looks at Ashley. Her eyes plead forgiveness.

<b>                                     RUDY

                         be working together here.

                         Get him back in the rig.

               Merlin and Jumpy wrench Rudy backward. Ashley reaches out to 
               him, starts to speak. He looks right through her. She goes 
               silent, casts her eyes to the snow.

<b>                                     PUG (O.S.)

               Everyone looks to the truck. Weasel-faced Pug has sidled 
               next to Gabriel. Spits some chaw.

               It hits Merlin's boots. Merlin growls.

<b>                                     PUG
</b>                         Whole time you were driving, he was 
                         telling her he's not the guy, he's 
                         not the guy. I know why he'd tell us 
                         he's not the guy. why's he telling 
                         her he's not the guy? What if he's 
                         not the guy?

               Gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. Walks to Rudy:

               Rudy raises a finger sharply. Silence. He continues eating.  
               Scrapes the last of his pie crumbs.

               Rudy stares hard. Gobbles the crumbs, washes it down with 
               his hot chocolate. Savors it. Sets the mug down.

               Gabriel nods to Jumpy, who snaps his arm up, SMASHING his 
               knuckles into Rudy's face.

               a tiny windowless closet. Rudy kicks a stall door, pacing.

               He stalks a circle, grabs a sink, and stares at his reflection 
               in the mirror. He looks a wreck. He settles down.

               A COUPLE leaves the booth behind Gabriel's crew. Pug and 
               Merlin reach over, steal their leftovers and dig in. Ashley 
               fidgets.

               Jumpy regards the garlands painted on the windows beside:

</b>                         I've read where the retail industry 
                         does fifty percent of its business 
                         between December 1st and December 
                         25th. Half the year's business, in 
                         one month's time. It seems to me an 
                         intelligent society would legislate 
                         a second such gift-giving holiday, 
                         create, say, a Christmas Two -- late 
                         May, early June -- to further 
                         stimulate growth and prosperity. For 
                         who would protest such a holiday? 
                         Taking the fifty percent model, a 
                         Christmas Two would grow this 
                         country's annual per capita income

               Rudy crouches behind the door, a piece of iron pipe in his 
               grip, ready to strike. Listening... listening...

               AS the door SLAMS open, swinging fast and BASHING him in the 
               head.

               Rudy tags the floor, drops the pipe, knocked out.

               Merlin and Pug gaze down on him, shaking their heads. Pug 
               spits tobacco. Hits Merlin's boots again.

               Rudy's back, with a new facial bruise. Ashley reaches for

               A WAITRESS comes over, drops their check on the table. It 
               rests near Rudy. Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel.

               And pushes the check his way.

               The "Motor City Monster" RUMBLES along a two-lane blacktop. 
               Across barren Michigan tundra. A sign reads "You Are Now

               they pass a brightly neon-lit building, with a parking lot 
               full of cars. The Tomahawk Casino, with a red neon axe

               Gabriel tosses him a TV remote. Merlin rips the room's phone 
               out of the wall, takes it. They return to the hallway.

               The truckers leave. Rudy tugs at his ankle cuff, sighs, 
               collapses back on the bed. Ashley has remained.

               Rudy sits up, sees her.

               Ashley pulls away, walks to the door. Turns back, wanting to 
               say something, but Rudy's not even looking her way.

               With a fiery look, she strides from the room.

               Rudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. Checks the end 
               table, finds a Bible and a deck of cards.

               Out his second-floor window is a view of the rear parking 
               lot.

               Rudy watches as a Chevy Blazer parks and two drunk FISHERMEN 
               get out. The truck's bumper sticker reads "Ice Fishermen Do 
               It All Year Long."

               Rudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. He

               Rudy's in "disguise": paste-on goatee, tinted shades and 
               black cowboy gear. Very Nashville Network.

               He's wedged between Jumpy and Merlin, wearing handcuffs. 
               Gabriel, Ashley and Pug in the back.

               Rudy stamps feet, shivering in the cold, as Merlin unlocks

               Gabriel glares, turns to his crew. Mutters, rubs his fingers 
               together. Merlin, Pug and Jumpy reach for their wallets, 
               grumbling. Gabriel takes a few twenties from each.

               Rudy nods thanks as Gabriel hands him the cash --

               Rudy pockets the wad, hooks his elbow for Ashley to slip her 
               arm through. Grins with a drawl:

               The cascade of JINGLING and JANGLING COINS fills the brightly 
               lit, horrendously-carpeted space. Wooden-beamed ceilings 
               suggest a rustic theme, but the neon slots, lush green tables 
               and red wheels of fortune are pure Midwest Vegas.

               The Tomahawk is tiny by Nevada standards, about the size of 
               a large bingo hall. This morning, about FIFTY GAMBLERS mill 
               about.

               Skimpily-dressed COCKTAIL WAITRESSES, most of them Powahachee 
               Indians, pimp drinks. Bored DEALERS deal.

               in the system -- "Big, BIG Winners" and flips it over. Presses 
               play. The sounds of JINGLING and JANGLING return.

               An office overlooking the casino floor through smoked glass. 
               JACK BANGS, late 50's, silver-hair, capped teeth, shark suit 
               and high blood pressure, paces his office. He's got the air

               Tommarkin, one of those hacks. Right now he's all caffeine.

               out the layout. In reality, he's surveying the GAMBLERS.

               Passing the cage, he walks right by Jack Bangs and the Indian 
               governors. Jack Bangs is all smiles, while the governors 
               turn their backs an him and storm out.

               running figure now only fifty yards distant.

               ANGLE to show Merlin's striding right in Rudy's bootprints. 
               Pug FIRES off two shots.

               They KICK UP snow just behind Rudy, struggling, panting...

                         fifteen, twenty-hour days.

               Rudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush 
               away his footprints. Realizes it's useless.

               A BULLET whistles through the pine branches.

               Rudy takes a breath, crashes onward --

               -- then stops at the sound of a RUMBLING. Getting louder. 
               Closer. It's a car's engine.

               Rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out 
               a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale. 
               Another BULLET smashes treebark. Rudy runs for it.

<b>               EXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY

               As Rudy leaps out to wave down the car, as around the corner 
               comes a Chevy Nova --

               -- with Gabriel and Ashley inside. Gabriel's eyes widen, he 
               floors the gas, RACING right for Rudy.

               Rudy scampers toward the opposite roadside, a steep wooded 
               slope cradling a meadow and frozen river --

<b>                                     ASHLEY
</b>                         No!!!

               -- as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the 
               other way. Gabriel fights her for control --

               -- as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road, 
               hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom, 
               a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow!

               On the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel 
               leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road.

<b>               AT THE SLOPE'S BOTTOM
</b>
               Rudy pops to his feet, a dazed snowball.

<b>               BACK UP AT THE ROAD
</b>
               Gabriel grabs a rifle from the Nova, steps to the slope-top 
               edge and takes aim --

               -- as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind --

               Sending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding 
               and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp --

<b>               TO THE BOTTOM
</b>
               -- where they come to a tangled, snowy halt. Gabriel struggles 
               to clear the ice from his face --

               -- as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw.

<b>                                     RUDY

               He extends a hand to Ashley --

</b>                         Come on.

               -- and hauls her to her feet. Ashley beams. As Gabriel howls, 
               the two of them scramble away from the woods, Rudy with the 
               rifle, toward the meadow and its frozen pond.

               More GUNSHOTS ring as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug slide their way 
               down the ravine.

<b>               EXT. FROZEN RIVER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Rudy and Ashley race out across the ice. The traction's 
               slippery, but there's no way around. There's a highway bridge 
               two hundred yards away, with sparse truck traffic.

<b>                                     RUDY

</b>                         Nick, the ice is --

<b>                         HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
</b>
               He grips her hand tighter, as SHOTS crash into the ice at 
               their feet. Suddenly, the ground splinters and gives way --

               -- and Ashley goes plummeting through to the river! She 
               vanishes from sight in an instant!

               Rudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. He stares, stunned, at 
               the ripples in the freezing water.

               Ashley's not coming up.

<b>               RUDY
</b>
               Looks to the truckers in pursuit. Coming down the ridge.

               Then the highway. Safety within sight.

               But he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly 
               and LEAPS into the ice-hole --

<b>               EXT. RIVER BENEATH THE ICE
</b>
               -- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body 
               like needles. He writhes, spinning around --

               -- and sees Ashley ten yards away, desperately pounding at 
               the ice above her. Strength giving out.

               Rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights, 
               panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further 
               away from the opening.

               With Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm, 
               pressing the barrel against the ice above them --

               -- and FIRES. A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray-
               blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in. Ashley reaches 
               for a sheath of ice, splashing --

<b>               TO THE SURFACE
</b>
               -- clutching frozen ground, treading water. Rudy surfaces 
               beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge.

               Instinctively, they spin around --

<b>               TO FIND GABRIEL, MERLIN, JUMPY AND PUG
</b>
               -- standing right behind them. Guns trained.

               He extends his hand, a gesture of help. But menacing.

               Pitch black. We can barely make out a huddled, fetal form, 
               quaking and trembling. It's Rudy. Dripping wet, on the verge 
               of hypothermia. Trying to stay conscious:

               The trailer doors swing open, crashing harsh light upon him. 
               He squints into the light, shivering madly.

               Gabriel is hurling darts again, focused, expressionless. 
               Bullseye.

               Merlin and Jumpy haul Rudy in. He collapses at Gabriel's 
               feet, unable to stand. Still trembling.

               A couple KIDS scamper into the doorway --

               another bullseye, then retrieves his darts from the board.

               Gabriel strides back to him, with two darts.

                         help.

               He lifts Rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. Rudy's 
               fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to 
               wedge it in.

</b>                         May the best sportsman win.

               Gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his 
               dart. It thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring.

</b>                         Damn.

               He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, 
               trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, 
               tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws --

               -- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his 
               icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally 
               tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet.

               Gabriel smiles, steps close.

               into a chair, flanked by video games.

               Gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and 
               wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the 
               wall beside his ear.

               He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third 
               HITS the wall by his chin.

                              (frightening calm)
                         Did you tell your manager there's 
                         gonna be a robbery?

               Gabriel pulls the darts free. Backs away again.

               -- and then lowers it. Believing he's gotten a reprieve, 
               Rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control.

               Gabriel rears back and WHISTLES another dart. It plugs into 
               Rudy's chest. Rudy screams. Gabriel FIRES another, skewering 
               him in the ribs. Then a third, fourth and fifth.

               Rudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. Five 
               darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering 
               and spreading rivulets of blood.

               Rudy gets hurled inside by Merlin and Jumpy. He hits the 
               floor beside the bed, where Ashley sits prisoner. Pug sits 
               guard, watching "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" on TV.

               She falls to his side. Merlin cuffs Rudy's ankle again to 
               the bedframe. He and Jumpy head out --

               Pug snaps to. Shuts off the TV, spits some chaw on the floor 
               and gone. Rudy and Ashley are left alone.

               Ashley helps pull his shirt off, sees the wounds:

                         acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry 
                         buns...

               Ashley has leapt to the bathroom. She brings wet washcloths 
               back to clean and dress --

                         Why'd you save me?

               Rudy studies her hopeful face, attending to his wounds. still 
               weak and distant:

               Rudy touches a hand to her hair.

               Ashley stares, touched, still kneading the cloth into his 
               chest.

               Rudy struggles up, his face level with hers. She kisses him 
               tenderly. Lingering.

               And this time Rudy responds, mouth seeking, working down her 
               neck.

               Her eyes flutter closed.

               Ashley hesitates. Carefully strokes his chest. He's still 
               kissing her, softly, still somewhat delirious.

               As he returns to her lips, mouths joining. Ashley's eyes 
               close again, as they fold into each other...

               A medieval-themed biergarten. A happy FAMILY of five sits at 
               a booth, singing along to "Good King Wencelas."

               In the booth beside, Merlin and Pug are holding court. 
               Merlin's puffing smoke rings. Pug watches dully, chewing:

                         build him one outta silicon so the 
                         poor boy could talk. You ever see a 
                         motherfucker with a silicon fucking

               The Happy Family stops singing. Pug considers, spits a wad.

               The Happy Family trade discomfited looks. Merlin shrugs,

                         some silicon-fucking-lips?

               The Happy Family flees their booth. Pug and Merlin glance 
               over. And grab their leftovers. Rifling the grub:

               Behind them, Gabriel and Jumpy file into the biergarten, 
               leading Rudy and Ashley to the booth. Meeting commenced.

               Rudy, battered and freezer-burnt, gets shoved in first. 
               Gabriel throws down the casino map:

               Rudy takes the map, glances at Ashley, and then takes charge. 
               For the first time, he's giving the orders:

                         the guards. Place doesn't look much 
                         richer than when I worked there, so 
                         let's figure you're gonna have to 
                         deal with ten of 'em. There'll be 
                         two on the floor, walking the room, 
                         that leaves eight up above. Eyes in 
                         the sky. They see something up, 
                         they're the ones who'll hit the silent 
                         alarm and you're fucked.

               Rudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area:

                         you'll get security coming through. 
                         what you gotta do, is get inside

                         down till some backup can get there. 
                         There's a security camera room that

                         he's got no guns; room's accessed by

               His confident manner wavers. Gabriel notices, narrows his

                         me.

               She searches his eyes, not quite understanding. But smiles. 
               Rudy smiles back, nods toward the door. Ashley slips out.

               When she's gone, Rudy stands and turns to the window. Outside, 
               the Blazer with the "Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long" bumper 
               sticker still sits parked.

               Rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out-one of the 
               game room darts, flecked with blood.

<b>               HE GIVES IT A SOLEMN STARE
</b>
<b>               INT. RUDYS ROOM - MOMENTS L&TER - NIGHT
</b>
               Rudy lies on his back, under the bed frame, dart in hand. He 
               tears off the plastic feathering, to get at the cross-shaped 
               end, furthest-from the tip. Four protruding metal edges.

               He finds the Phillips screws on the bedframe, and tries to 
               work the dart-end into the grooves. It scrapes and jags, but 
               with pressure he's able to do a quarter-turn at a time.

               The screw starts spiraling out.

<b>               ANGLE ON BEDFRAME
</b>
               As two metal pieces split apart, and Rudy wriggles his ankle 
               handcuff off the frame.

<b>               ANGLE ON CLOSET
</b>
               As Rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips 
               the paper off, untwisting the wire.

<b>               ANGLE ON ROOM'S WINDOW
</b>
               As Rudy slides it open, and climbs outside.

<b>               EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
               Light snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window 
               into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He 
               stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer.

<b>               AT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER
</b>
               Rudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and 
               gear boxes in the back seat.

               He takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and 
               slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming 
               it around until it trips the door lock.

               The lock pops up; Rudy pops in --

<b>               INT. BLAZER
</b>
               -- and raids the gear box. Bait, reels, fishing wire. Boning 
               knives. A compass. A first aid kit. A switchblade.

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta 
                         be keeping a gun...

               He rustles around in the backseat. Ice cooler, open bag of 
               pork rinds, another gear box. Nothing.

               Some HEADLIGHTS sweep past the Blazer. Rudy ducks down, 
               pockets the switchblade. Munches some pork rinds.

<b>               EXT. PARKING LOT
</b>
               Rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. 
               And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing

<b>               MERLIN AND JUMPY
</b>
               stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way 
               toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear.

<b>               ON SCENE
</b>
               Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.  
               Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.

               Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, 
               heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances 
               back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem 
               to. They stand at the Nova, talking.

               Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs 
               turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. 
               He slips around the corner, out of sight.

<b>               AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL
</b>
               Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving 
               toward a side entry --

               -- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.

               Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling 
               water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this 
               wall.

               Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.

               Rudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting. 
               Because his breathing has stopped.

<b>               INT. HALLLWAY TO INDOOR POOL - NIGHT
</b>
               Rudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads 
               "Pool CLOSED. Open 9 am to 9 pm, No Lifeguard on Duty."

               Rudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. The 
               small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. From an 
               unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view --

               It's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface. Smiling 
               and splashing someone offscreen --

<b>                                     ASHLEY
</b>                         ...and he's saying "We're not gonna

                         gonna help him... we're gonna get it 
                         all...

               She splashes again. Taunting --

                         himself --

               As Gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward 
               her in the pool.

</b>                         No, baby. He wants me.

               Gabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. She smiles.

<b>                                     ASHLEY

               And they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples. 
               A steamy embrace.

<b>                                     ASHLEY

<b>               ANGLE ON RUDY

               in the shadows, hearing them. Staring into darkness.

<b>               IN THE POOL
</b>
               Gabriel turns with Ashley, wrapped together. Moving slow.

                         That's a book of love.

               They kiss again. Gabriel strokes her wet hair:

               still in the shadows, welling with betrayal.

               Rudy is gone.

<b>               INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Rudy strides a corridor, eyes dead ahead, passing a stairwell 
               on his way toward the "Exit" sign posted above a door. He's 
               almost there, marching fast --

               -- and Rudy dives to the stairwell, out of sight just as 
               Merlin and Jumpy stride back inside.

               Merlin trudges upward, while Rudy steps from hiding one flight 
               down.

               Rudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the 
               same Blazer. He jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free 
               the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro.  
               Stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact --

               Rudy jumps from the Blazer, looks at the lot, the highway, 
               the woods. His own footprints in the dusting snow.

               Realizing the answer, Rudy looks to his room's window. Forced 
               to race back. He tries clambering the wall, standing an 
               shrubbery, but he can't reach. He whirls, desperate.

               And his eyes find the Blazer.

               Rudy flings open the Blazer door, slams the emergency brake 
               down. Forces the gearshift into "Reverse."

               Merlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the

               Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding 
               on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front 
               bumper.

               The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs 
               ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space 
               below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up 
               speed, rolling on its own.

               Merlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key.

               The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his 
               feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper, 
               the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof --

               -- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs --

               -- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right

               -- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a

               -- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly 
               on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. 
               Spreading a deck of cards out before him.

               Starting a game of solitaire. He looks up.

</b>                         Hey.

               Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The 
               window's open. Rudy continues his card game.

               Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut.

               Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, 
               heart pounding. The cards go flying.

<b>               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
               The LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks 
               outside... and stops still. In parking lot...

               ...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's 
               seat. It's Merlin. Now watching.

               Rudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches 
               the falling snow. Caged again, after all.

               Pitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back 
               in.

               Seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket 
               over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him.

               Ashley closes her eyes. With a smile.

               A moment later, Rudy's eyes open. Turning to look at her 
               smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare...

<b>               EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
               The three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards 
               Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their 
               car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces 
               overnight.

               Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut. 
               Rudy hits the snow --

               Gabriel KICKS him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at 
               Rudy's head. Ashley screams, rushes him --

               -- as Gabriel's gun SHOOTS a thin stream of water into Rudy's 
               face.

               It's a forty-five caliber squirt gun.

                         got one.

               Gabriel tosses the water pistol onto Rudy's chest. Jumpy and 
               Pug haul him up. With venom:

               The Motor City Monster cruises the snowy landscape, with 
               Lake Superior beyond. Pug drives the Nova in convoy.

<b>               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG
</b>
               Gabriel hands copies of Rudy's sketched map to Merlin and 
               Jumpy.

               Rudy and Ashley are in the sleeper.

                         Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and 
                         John...

               Rudy watches them studying his made-up map. Ashley strokes 
               his arm, gives a loving smile. Rudy stares at her.

               He smiles right back.

<b>               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               The rig and the Nova blow by a roadsign: "Now Entering 
               Powahachee Indian Reservation Lands."

<b>               INT./EXT. TRAILER DAY - PREPARATION MONTAGE
</b>
               The storage locker with the Santa suits SLAMS open.

               Merlin's hands PULL automatics and shotguns from the weapons 
               chest. Pug's hands UNLOAD ammo.

               A red-and-white Santa coat gets PULLED ON and BUTTONED UP.

               Jumpy's hands apportion GUNS and AMMO on a picnic table.

               Black Santa boots STAMP TIGHT in the snow.

               A shoulder-strap ASSAULT RIFLE gets hidden under a Santa 
               coat.

               AMMO CLIPS are taped inside a fat black buckle-belt.

               A HANDGUN gets tucked under a Santa hat.

               And the rig's trailer doors come CRASHING SHUT.

<b>               EXT. LAKESIDE REST AREA - DUSK
</b>
               Lake Superior shimmers in the dying light. The rig's in the 
               empty rest area lot. On a nearby bank, four men in Santa 
               Claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic 
               tables, guns at their sides. Staring out at the lake.

<b>               RUDY AND ASHLEY
</b>
               sit apart from the rest. Rudy in a red suit, black boots, 
               cap in hand. Ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.

                         go...

               The Nova drives into the lot. Pug gets out, carrying several 
               fast-food bags. Hurrying to stay warm:

               As they continue chow dispersal, Rudy stares over the lake.

               Distant. Not even aware Ashley's there.

                         tomorrow. Little blaze in the 
                         fireplace. Mom's setting out the

                         singing along...

               Rudy smiles to himself. He's got a faraway look.

               sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white 
               cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast 
               beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a 
               savage bite.

               Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes.  
               Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water.

               Filled with the JINGLING, JANGLING slots, but there's only

               A ragged headquarters, looking down to the casino level 
               through smoked glass. Desks, file cabinets, pin-up 
               centerfolds. A room with video monitors to one side. Stairs 
               to a camera catwalk that rings the casino.

               Jack Bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. He opens a 
               battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the 
               bottle for himself. Walks over to his HEAD OF SECURITY,

               inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling 
               stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy:

               Rudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out.

               Gabriel's rig rumbles up the road.

               [NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end,

<b>               RUDY AND JUMPY

</b>                         Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you 
                         something. You have any problem with 
                         the fact that we're on our way to 
                         take millions of dollars from an 
                         Indian casino?

               The Native American considers. As they walk:

<b>                                     JUMPY
</b>                         Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's 
                         gone a long way toward restoring 
                         wealth and pride to communities who've 
                         been economically isolated and 
                         enslaved for centuries. Stronger 
                         infrastructure, better schools, higher 
                         employment... they're all the results 
                         of reservation casino success stories. 
                         Still, many natives believe that 
                         these are temples to a godless 
                         materialism and greed that will only 
                         infect the souls of indigenous peoples 
                         until their love of money has 
                         destroyed the spiritual values their 
                         ancestors died to protect and their 
                         homelands have become no different 
                         from any United States suburb, 
                         satellite city or industrial park.  
                         Destroying the Indian legacy once 
                         and for all and leaving behind a 
                         nation of selfish, angry natives, of

               Rudy grabs a wad of bills from his pocket, drops some to the

               Jovial ad libs as the Waitress brings Rudy's beer. Rudy 
               doubles down, busts, and gets belligerent:

               Jumpy has left the table, sidling to a change booth, glancing 
               at his watch. Passes a $100 bill:

               Rudy nods, slugging beer. He's becoming an unruly drinker. 
               The Old Timer motions to hit; but before the Dealer can pull 
               the card, Rudy slams the table, points to it:

               The dealer hits grandpa to twenty-one. Then hits Rudy and 
               busts him. Rudy stares darkly.

               -- as the other three guards FIRE back, forcing Merlin to 
               race behind the slots. BULLETS rip into slot machines --

               -- as GUNSHOTS ring out from the casino restaurant. Two of 
               the Guards spin to look behind them as --

               -- PUG storms in, contorted glee, twin pistols BLAZING, 
               popping a steel flurry into an outgunned Guard.

               Merlin spins from hiding behind the slots. He and Pug both 
               OPEN FIRE, blowing away the two remaining men from both sides.

               One of the guards falls in front of Rudy, gun in hand --

               -- but as Rudy-reaches for the guy's pistol --

<b>                                     MERLIN

                         gun's all you need.

               Merlin steps to him, gun aimed. He and Pug collect the Guards, 
               weapons.

<b>                                     MERLIN

               Rudy gets to his feet, pulls the water pistol from his pocket.

               Moves to round up the Old Timer, the waitress, the Poker 
               Players and the Fat Slots Women.

               The two Guards lie on the floor, with Security Boss and Video 
               Guard. And the ruined Jack Bangs.

               Gabriel storms to the video room's doorway. Slams a new clip.

               He OPENS FIRE, BLOWING AWAY the wall of monitors and VCR's 
               recording the robbery. SPARKS and METAL fly.

<b>               EXT. PARKING LOT
</b>
               Ashley waits in the Nova, checking her watch. Behind her a 
               RED WRANGLER rolls in and parks. A FIRE CHIEF and his DEPUTY, 
               just off-duty, stroll toward the casino, laughing.

               Ashley sinks low, panicked. Presses her HORN. The firemen 
               spin around but don't see her. They shrug. Keep walking.

<b>               INT. TOMAHAWK

               Rudy forces the gamblers and employees behind the bar. Onto 
               the floor with Bear the Bartender, whispering hard:

<b>                                     RUDY

                         My friends are disturbed --

               The hostages do as told. Rudy breathes relief, squirt gun in 
               hand. And then stares at the array of bottles around him.

<b>               IN THE CASHIER'S CAGE

               Merlin and Pug force the cashiers to the floor:

               Pug bangs the guy's head off the floor, stalks to the Count 
               Room door. Just a key lock. Pug BLOWS it away with his guns, 
               kicks the door open --

               -- and gets SHOT TO HELL by three COUNT MEN inside, pistols 
               blazing! Pug puppets, dead. A wad of chaw hits the ceiling.

               Stunned Merlin FIRES BACK.

               Merlin and Jumpy leap up, GUNS BLAZING, firing through the 
               cage bars at the Count Men. Killing all three just as --

               storm through the doors, pistols ready --

               Merlin and Jumpy are caught. Trade a look. And let their 
               weapons fall, turning just as --

<b>               THE CHEVY NOVA
</b>
               CRASHES through the casino doors, MOWING DOWN the firemen!

               The car SLAMS inside, crashing into slot machines. The slots 
               send SPARKS showering into the air. Which set off the casino 
               floor's SPRINKLERS. The room fills with watery spray.

               Ashley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle. Rudy stares 
               darkly at her. She knows he knows. And she doesn't care.

               Jumpy, Merlin, Ashley and Rudy step inside the Count Room. 
               There are stacks and stacks of bills.

               Ashley smiles wide, throws Jumpy three laundry sacks.

               Gabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage. 
               The taped jingle of slots still plays.

               Poor Jack Bangs lies on his desk, beaten to a pulp. Blood 
               runs down his face and shark suit. Tears and shock:

               Merlin and Jumpy lead Rudy in. Ashley follows. They carry 
               bulging money sacks. Gabriel stares Rudy down.

               Gabriel pushes Rudy's head toward the desk. Jack Bangs,

               Gabriel grabs Rudy, slams him against a wall. He glares at

               Gabriel steps to the liquor cabinet, feels at the shelves. 
               They split in the middle. And there is a combination safe 
               mounted in the back. Gabriel turns to Jack Bangs:

                         Pow. Wow.

               And Jack Bangs opens it --

               -- reaching inside in the same swift motion, so that as the 
               safe swings open to reveal it's a rack of WEAPONS that lies 
               inside, Jack Bangs already has an Uzi in hand --

               BULLETS as he turns back to the room --

               -- sending Gabriel, Ashley, and Merlin diving for the floor! 
               Jumpy can't get down, as BULLETS riddle him dead --

               -- and BLOW OUT the smoked windows overlooking the casino --

               Jack Bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle --

               -- BLOWING OUT the windows to the parking lot, shattering 
               the liquor, sending Rudy scrambling under his desk --

               He and Ashley both scramble for the windows, jumping out 
               with two of the money sacks --

<b>               TO THE CASINO FLOOR
</b>
               -- and landing on poker tables below, overturning them --

               Jack Bangs keeps FIRING, into the casino, SHREDDING the tables 
               but missing Gabriel and Ashley -- as he JUMPS right after 
               them.

<b>               BACK IN BANGS' OFFICE
</b>
               Merlin scrambles to his feet, whirling with his gun, looking 
               for Rudy --

               -- just as Rudy slams into him. Merlin's SHOT hits the 
               ceiling.

               The two of them CRASH down, wrestling and rolling toward the 
               parking lot window. Two guns spill to the floor. Rudy grabs 
               one, just as Merlin kicks out, leaping up --

               -- and freezes, seeing Rudy's got a pistol on him.

               Before Merlin can make a move, Rudy fires --

               -- and a thin stream of water shoots out. Leaving a stain on 
               his shirt. It's the water pistol. Rudy stares blankly.

               As Merlin swiftly snatches the second gun, a real gun, off 
               the floor. Rudy's dead to rights.

<b>                                     MERLIN
</b>                         Hell. I'm gonna take pleasure in 
                         this...

               With the gun on Rudy, Merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets.

               Pops it between his lips, raises a lighter's flame --

               -- and hesitates. Sniffing the air. Looking down.

               At the stain on his shirt. His lighter still lit --

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         Me too.

               -- and Rudy fires the water pistol again, this time catching 
               Merlin's lighter, which turns the stream into a ARC OF FIRE! 
               He's filled alcohol in the gun!

               FLAMING LIQUOR shoots into Merlin's face and eyes. He drops 
               the handgun. Rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun, spreading 
               the fire down his neck and chest. Merlin howls wildly --

               -- and staggers back, blind and helpless, pinwheeling himself --

<b>               OUT THE PARKING LOT WINDOW
</b>
               -- and CRASHING down on the hood of a Pontiac, head through 
               the windshield, boots on the bumper, dead. Flames flickering.

<b>                                     RUDY

<b>               IN THE CASINO
</b>
               Gabriel and Ashley have scrambled to the Nova, tumbling in 
               with the money sacks. Jack Bangs gets up, stalking toward 
               them, still FIRING and babbling.

               Gabriel FIRES back, hitting Bangs in the chest. He staggers, 
               but stays upright. His bullets RIDDLE the car, shattering 
               the windshield, but Gabriel and Ashley keep their heads down, 
               slamming it into reverse --

               -- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, 
               into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight.

               Jack Bangs stops shooting.

               He staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, 
               gun still raised.

               Rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. 
               He puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in Bangs, 
               face. The uzi drops to the ground.

               A silence. Even the slots have stopped.

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         I'm sorry.

               Jack Bangs stares blankly. Surveys the wreckage of his poor 
               man's empire. And gives a small shrug.

<b>                                     JACK BANGS
</b>                         That's why they call it gambling.

               He slumps against the bar and hits the floor. Dead.

<b>               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
               Rudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He 
               takes a few wary steps toward the road --

               -- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind 
               him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head.

<b>                                     ASHLEY

               Rudy shuts his eyes for the end.

<b>               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
               The Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in 
               reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley 
               collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab.

<b>               EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               The Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a 
               couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way.

<b>               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG
</b>
               Gabriel and Ashley inside, with the money sacks:

<b>                                     GABRIEL
</b>                         With the wrong fucking guy! We took

                         guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is 
                         that Christmas?!

               He grabs Ashley, kisses her wildly. Then turns back --

<b>               TO THE SLEEPER COMPARTMENT
</b>
               Where Rudy lies sideways, hands bound with his Santa belt.

<b>                                     GABRIEL
</b>                         God bless us every one...

<b>               EXT. RIDGESIDE ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
               A winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a 
               grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been 
               no traffic here for awhile.

               The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. 
               Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is 
               fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge.

               A hundred-foot drop into the ravine below.

               Gabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer 
               gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer 
               to five feet away from, the ravine drop.

<b>               IN THE CAB
</b>
               Gabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back --

<b>               TO THE RAVINE'S EDGE
</b>
               -- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is 
               in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with 
               a can of gasoline.

<b>                                     GABRIEL
</b>                         You almost got away with it, Santa. 
                         Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your 
                         car, got halfway to Canada till you 
                         caught some ice in the road. By the 
                         time you hit bottom down there, whole 
                         car was burning like a comet.  Musta 
                         burned up all that money too.

               Rudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls 
               of bills into the car.

                         was three, or four... or five. Four

                         hers.

               Gabriel smiles at him.

<b>                                     GABRIEL
</b>                         She told me 'bout the convict 
                         magazines. Had to figure there'd be 
                         some boys in the pen with some useful 
                         knowledge. With nobody to talk to. 
                         Nobody to listen. So we stocked up 
                         on stationery.

               Ashley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her.

               Rudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back.

               So cold. But Rudy doesn't pause.

<b>                                     RUDY
</b>                         Maybe this is where you wanted him, 
                         Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine, 
                         dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. 
                         Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause 
                         what you did for him was make him 
                         the happiest held ever been. You 
                         showed him hope and taught him mercy.  
                         And he died a peaceful man. You wanted 
                         to destroy some convict... and all 
                         you did was save his soul. Remember 
                         that. Love your money and remember 
                         that.

               Ashley shivers, a touch shaken. But steels herself:

               Gabriel hauls him up. Marches him to the trailer. Rudy stops 
               at the ramp. Gabriel pushes. Rudy doesn't move.

               He stares her down. Then stares at Gabriel.

               Ashley stares daggers. Shakes her head ruefully --

               -- and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart.

               Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of 
               shock. Blood spurts through his red coat. He stares at Ashley, 
               incredulous.

               She steps forward and PUTS another bullet in his neck. Gabriel 
               falls still.

               Ashley's breath frosts in the cold.

               Rudy watches her. Finally, she meets Rudy's eyes. They stare 
               each other down for a long moment, before:

               A silence.

               No one moves.

               And finally, the CRUNCH of footsteps from around the side of 
               the trailer. And WHISTLING. "Silver Bells."

               A shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon 
               steps into Rudy and Ashley's view.

               It's Nick Mason.

               Alive and well.

               Ashley smiles. Her muscles-and-mustache man pen pal is here.

               They share a passionate kiss. Ashley malts at the sight of 
               him, embracing happily. Then turns to Rudy:

               Rudy just stands there, his mind playing catch-up.

                         Duncan, I did almost a year with him

                         time, made him feel like he really

               Nick shrugs. Prods Rudy up the ramp. Into the trailer:

                         Keep your gun on him.

               Nick forces Rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and 
               lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel.

                         Said some nice things about me, Rudy. 
                         I appreciate it. But don't worry. I

                         had that right all along.

               Nick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car 
               into "Drive." Turns to Ashley:

</b>                         Sweetness! Let's light up the tree!

               Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick 
               steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.

<b>               IN THE CAR
</b>
               Rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his 
               wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of 
               his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point --

               -- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The 
               switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to 
               his right wrist!

               Rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through 
               the Santa belt --

               -- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either 
               Ashley or Nick to see --

<b>               IN THE TRAILER
</b>
               Ashley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick 
               is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp --

               The belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of 
               trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column, 
               RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free!

               As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races 
               over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the 
               dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy --

               -- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate 
               the right leads --

               Ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the 
               flaming car to the trailer's edge --

               -- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead --

               -- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire --

<b>               IN THE CAR

               Rudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him --

               Rudy slams the gearshift into "Reverse", grabs the wheel and 
               looks over his shoulder at shocked Nick behind him --

               As the burning Nova races backwards up the ramp, and back 
               into the trailer --

               Terrified Nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go --

               -- and the car SLAMS into the trailer's back, CRUSHING Nick's

               Ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage. 
               She grabs her handgun, OPENS FIRE --

               -- and Rudy SLAMS the gas again, shooting down the ramp --

               -- as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls --

               -- while the burning Nova COLLIDES with Ashley, throwing her 
               onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off 
               the ridgetop --

               -- arcing slowly as it PLUMMETS into the ravine, a smoking, 
               blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on.

               The shooting star hits Earth and explodes.

               Rudy staggers to his feet. Battered and dazed. Looks at 
               Gabriel's body. Then looks to the trailer.

               Inside, Nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist 
               down.

               Rudy climbs the tire ramp. And pulls the trailer gate shut.

               He climbs into the rig's cab. Starts the engine. Puts the 
               truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.

               Rudy listens to its TUMBLING SOUNDS all the way to the bottom. 
               He then looks up the road one way. Then the other.

               And notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow.

               He stares at them.

               A long time.

               roads and highways. And passing a roadsign that reads "Sidnaw -- 
               35 Miles."

               He passes rural roads and driveways, and every time he comes 
               across a mailbox... he puts a stack of cash inside. On the 
               soundtrack, the STRINGS and RUM-PUM-PUM-PUMS of "The Little 
               Drummer Boy" start to rise --

               With snow falling, he passes a new sign: "Sidnaw -- 27 Miles."

               With the sun rising, a PAIR OF CHILDREN huddle at a window, 
               seeing the man in the Santa suit at the end of their driveway. 
               Giving them something from his sack and ambling on.

               -- and we follow Rudy's march, stuffing presents into

               The Santa Claus shuffles inside, right past them.

               The Santa Claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room, 
               finding a dozen RELATIVES, laughing and eating. A table laden 
               with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and 
               wine.

               The relatives stop still. The room goes silent.

               The Santa Claus sits down at the head of the table.

               Yes, it's Rudy.

               Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes 
               a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings, 
               and sets it in front of him.

               And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence.

               His Mother and Father return to the dining room, gaping. The 
               other relatives look likewise.

               All staring at Rudy.

               Then, while he eats, without another sound...

               ...the Mother takes her seat at the table...

               ...and the Father pulls up another chair.

               They touch hands privately, and turn back to their plates.

               There's a CLANK of silverware, a SCRAPE of china, a CLINK of 
               glass, and one-by-one, the relatives resume their meals.  
               CONVERSATION picks up where it left off, SMILES return to 
               the table, LAUGHTER slowly rises in the room.

               There is Mr. Duncan and Mrs. Duncan, Aunt Lisbeth and Uncle 
               Ray, Aunt Mary and Uncle Pete, toddler Sasha and teenage 
               Sam, brother Mike and his girlfriend Jill, sister Stacy and 
               her husband Bill, Grandpa Walter, little Wendy Sue...

               ...and at the head of the table...

               Rudy Duncan.

               Home for Christmas.
