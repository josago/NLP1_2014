</b><b>1   A FLASH OF LIGHT                                            1
</b>    A radiant shiny something dazzling in EXTREME CLOSEUP.
<b>    BEGIN TITLES.
</b>    CAMERA very slowly PULLS   BACK. The sparkling surface
    turns out to be a lot of   carats. WE SEE the stone, then
    the ring, then suddenly,   in b.g., something HUGE SWEEPS
    by. REVEAL a mechanical    claw above the ring, hanging
    from a crane. The ring    sits in a sea of tiny dolls,
    joke eyeballs, and other   carnival junk.
    The claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes
    catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it --
    accompanied by OOHS and AAHS (O.S.) of hope and disap-
    pointment. INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man
    working the controls. The EYES of a young black woman
    watching him work. Another guy's HANDS digging in his
    pocket for change. QUARTERS going into the slot.
<b>                             MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>               This'll never work, Tommy.
<b>                             TOMMY (O.S.)
</b>               Be positive, Armando. Course it will.
    The claw inadvertently snags a rabbit's foot.
<b>                              TOMMY (O.S.)
</b>               Look.   See what a lucky fuck I am?
<b>                             WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>               He don't mean the ring, hon, he
               means the whole plan.

<b>                              TOMMY (O.S.)
</b>               So do I.
    The claw catches the   ring and closes on it. QUICK CUTS
    of their FACES as the   crane rises. A very pretty lady.
    A beefy Latino with a   two-day beard. Their apprehension.
    Tommy's confidence.    Then his exceptional smile. He gets
    the ring.

                      (returning to the
                       claw)
               You got quarters, Loretta?

<b>3   EXT. FLORIDA LUXURY HOTEL - DAY                             3
</b>    Palm trees. The smell of money. Valets in Foreign
    Legion khakis greeting arriving luxury cars.
<b>4   INT. HOTEL FUNCTION ROOM - DAY                              4
</b>    A big crowd of GUESTS at a cocktail reception. A lot
    of lime jackets, cherry trousers, and blue hair. People
    wear name tags.
    ON Tommy, in pastel bow tie and full waiter drag, con-
    firming orders for a group of guests. He speaks in a
<b>    PRISSY, OVER-SOLICITIOUS VOICE:
</b><b>                           TOMMY
</b>             That's a diet ginger ale, an extra-
             spicy virgin mary no salt, a club
             soda -- good choice -- a lime
             rickey, and a bourbon and a
             planter's punch. Five people,
             five drinks... it's Kismet!
    Tommy turns away, looking toward the entrance to the
    room.
<b>5   INT. LOBBY - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - THE RING                    5
</b>    glittering on Loretta's finger. LORETTA, stunning in
    designer clothing and accessories, enters. Her looks
    attract looks.
<b>6   INT. FUNCTION ROOM - DAY                                    6
</b>    Tommy, maintaining his vantage point, repeats another
    order, this time in a heavy CARRIBEAN ACCENT:
<b>                           TOMMY
</b>             That's a vodka tonic, a Pellegrino,
             lime and no ice, a gin Gibson
             straight up with ex-tra onions
             -- I am also fond of de onions --
             and a Chardonnary spritzer...also
             with extra onions -- no, no, do
             not worry, that is just a little
             joke. There will be no onions
             whatsoever in your spritzer!
    He LAUGHS HUGELY, rather amused with himself.   The guests
    aren't.
<b>                           GUEST
</b>             You don't need to write it down?

</b>             Mr. Memory?   Do not make me laugh!
    He LAUGHS HUGELY, turns, takes two steps away and makes
    absolutely no effort to get their drinks. He looks
    toward the door.
<b>7   INT. HALLWAY/ENTRANCE TO FUNCTION ROOM - DAY              7
</b>    Loretta approaches the function room, where pert  DEBBIE,
    wearing a JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS button, staffs a  felt-
    covered table. On  a nearby easel, a photo of a  silver-
    haired Man with a legend in blue and gold: JEFF   JOHNSON.
<b>    THE NAME YOU KNOW.

                    (consulting a list)
             Do we have your check yet?
    Loretta pulls a Mont Blanc pen and a checkbook from her
    bag.
<b>                           LORETTA
</b>             No, honey, I don't think you do, we
             just got in last night from our
             place in Barbados -- how much is it?

<b>                           DEBBIE
</b>             Five hundred a person.   Barbados?

             Yes, we're just down the beach
             from Mick Jagger and Jerry.
                    (looking up)
             You wouldn't turn down a couple of
             thousand, would you?
    A pleased smile from Debbie. Loretta opens the check-
    book, flashing the immense RING in front of Debbie.
<b>                           DEBBIE
</b>             Um, that's a lovely ring.

    ON Tommy watching Loretta. A Guest standing just behind
    Tommy -- wearing MRS. ZEKE BRIDGES name tag -- watches
    JEFF JOHNSON gladhand the room robustly.
<b>                           MRS. BRIDGES

</b>                    (chuckling)
             The sum' bitch looks terrific.

    Tommy, eavesdropping, joins Zeke's chuckle, which unfor-
    tunately turns into a wheeze and then a cough. Zeke
    turns to Tommy.
<b>                           ZEKE

    ON JEFF JOHNSON with his well-groomed wife, VERA, and a
    barrel-chested Man in full resort wear, wearing an OLAF

             it off   in the ladies' room to wash my
             hands.    I was just putting it on --
             I must   have dropped it.

</b>              It was my honor to serve in Congress with
              Jeff Johnson for a generation. No one
              could have been a better legislator. No
              one could have been a finer husband and
              father. And now --
     He presses the tips of his fingers together and looks
     skyward, as if communing with his memory of the deceased.

<b>                            DODGE
</b>              And now God has called his servant home.

              so like him -- working late into the

              Let a few days pass to show proper
              respect. But next week, I want to

              Vera. With your name, you can't
              lose. People around these parts

</b>              Dick, I was a Washington wife for
              twenty years. Twenty years of

              paved with gold. This is a town
              where the marks give you money
              before you ask. A town where they
              take you to dinner after you fuck
              'em. A town where when they need
              money, they just print more. This
              is a town where a guy bounced nine
              hundred checks and he didn't even
              have to skip town!!!

              You know how much a congressman
              makes? A hundred and thirty a year
              -- and that's just base pay for
              getting your ass elected. Then
              there are these things called PACs,
              and these lobbyists, whose whole
              point in life is to buy you off.

     Reinhardt runs up.

</b>              I got lucky at the Madison. Thank

              Uruguay. Their delegation just
              checked out.

</b>              So when does the House open for
              business?
     Reinhardt hasn't heard it put quite that way before.
     Reinhardt gets his courage up.

</b>              There's something I wanted to ask you.
              I know it's a big step, but -- I'd
              like you to consider me to be your AA.
<b>                            TOMMY
</b>              That's quite an offer, Reinhardt,
              very decent of you, but I'm just a
              social drinker.

     out on a brutally ugly courtyard. On the other side of

     fences crammed with junk -- and an occasional xerox
     machine, Mr. Coffee, and pitiful staffer at a tiny desk.

     Tommy was born to wear a  tux. In his  lapel, a red-and-

     shoulderless and nearly  backless gown, with three-quarter
     gloves. The other Women   in sight are far more conserva-

     She points at the food table. There's nothing but a
     few boxes of crackers and two huge mounds of herring --

</b>     The committee members -- all white males, except Tommy --
     mill around, awaiting the start of the hearings. As the
     TV cameras whir, Dodge shakes Tommy's hand warmly. Big
     smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs.
     Dodge breaks off and Tommy drifts over to Reinhardt.

     Dodge steers TJ to a preppy-looking man at the witness
     table -- BARCLAY "SKEETER" WARBURTON.
<b>                            DODGE
</b>              Skeeter, do you know Tommy Johnson?

</b>              "Tommy. Please. Been called

     on his left and right.

</b>     Capitol Hill is actually two worlds: the aboveground
     buildings that visitors and television cameras see, and
     the catacombs, the busy tunnels and corridors connecting
     the congressional office buildings and the Capitol.
     They're surprisingly unglamorous -- exposed pipes, white-
     washed brick walls, dumpsters, pizza carry-outs -- and
     through them move the legislators and their staffs.
     And here is Tommy, whistling ZIPPEDY DOO DAH. He loves
     this place. Passing a snack bar, he greets the Cashier.

                 office with Olaf Andersen of Gulf
                 Coast Power, and his lobbyist,
                 Mr. Tommy O'Connor --
                        (indicating)
                 these gentlemen here. Chairman
                 Dodge and I listened in astonishment
                 as Olaf Andersen offered us seven
                 figures -- that's one million
                 dollars, ladies and gentlemen.

</b>               I'll tell you who. Nobody! Nobody
               gets five hundred bucks an hour to
               lobby for the average Joe! There's
               no Shnook PAC! There's no National
               Association for Ordinary Assholes!
               Sure, everyone's against cancer, but
               "everyone" doesn't have an office
               on K Street!
                      (to committee Members)
               Don't you folks get it? We're
               supposed to be the people's lobbyists.
               Congress is supposed to be America's
               political action committee.

      APPLAUSE and SHOUTS of support. Several Members on the
      dais join the applause, seeing a winning issue.
      CELIA shakes her head in wonder.
      Tommy goes to Mickey and stands her up on a chair.

      Tommy is engulfed by people and lights.
      Dodge, Andersen, and O'Connor -- desperate, snarling --
      are pinned to the wall by the SHOUTING Press Corps.

      Tommy pulls it from his pocket, glances at it, and tosses
      it away.
