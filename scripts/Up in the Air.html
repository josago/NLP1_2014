           to feel the straps on your
           shoulders... You feel them?
           (gives us a beat)
           Now, I want you to pack it with all
           the stuff you have in your life.
           Start with the little things. The
           stuff in drawers and on shelves.
           The collectables and knick-knacks.
           Feel the weight as it adds up. Now,
           start adding the larger stuff. Your
           clothes, table top appliances,
           lamps, linens, your TV. That
           backpack should be getting pretty
           heavy at this point - Go Bigger.
           Your couch, your bed, your kitchen
           table. Stuff it all in... Your car,
           get it in there... Your home,
           whether you have a studio apartment
           or a two story house, I want you to
           stuff it into that backpack.

           your way to the people you trust
           with your most intimate secrets.

           cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get
           your sisters and your brothers and
           you parents. Get them all in that

          It was January and I had just
          gotten my driver's license. The
          lakes were frozen over, so we piled
          into my car and hit the ice to do
          donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit
          a soft spot and the hood of my car
          tilted up and I was sinking
          backwards into the water.

</b><b>                          RYAN
</b>          I literally started to drown.
          Within a few seconds, I black out.
          Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a
          helicopter, laying on a stretcher.
          This guy in a uniform is telling me I
          was minutes away from dying.

           (relives it for a second)
           So just as we're hovering over the
           hospital, I sit up. And from there,
           I could see the whole western
           horizon. We'd been flying twenty
           minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a
           city I'd thought of as remote,
           halfway across the state... a
           foreign capital.
<b>                          (A BEAT)
</b>           My parents had taught me we lived
           in the best place on Earth, but now
           I could see the world was really
           just one place and comparing didn't
           make much sense. And I remember
           thinking - Don't tell me this isn't
           an age of miracles. Don't tell me
           we can't be everywhere at once.
<b>

</b>           I don't know what originally
           sparked the back pack. I probably
           needed to be alone. Recently, I've
           been thinking that maybe I needed
           to empty the bag before I knew what
           to put back in.

</b>          And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous
          kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people
          kiss in the first place.
<b>                         
</b>          Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The
          motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the
          software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.

</b>           To whom it may concern, I can't even
           count the number of people I've fired
           in my lifetime. So many, that I've
           forgotten what it's like to actually
           hire somebody. We've never met, but I
           know you'd be lucky to have Natalie
           Keener. My advice? Take her and don't
           look back. She'll be the best
           decision you've made in a long time.

</b>          Ryan walks through the automated door. He looks like he did
          in the opening of the film. Maybe even wearing the same
          clothes. Something is different though.

</b>           Tonight, most people will be
           welcomed home by jumping dogs and
           squealing kids. Their spouses will
           ask about their day and tonight
           they'll sleep.
<b>                         
</b>          Ryan stops and looks up at a GIANT BOARD OF DESTINATIONS. An
          endless list of cities around the world. A menu of new lives
          departing every five minutes.

<b>                         
</b>          We look back at Ryan. His eyes lock on one of the cities. We
          don't see which one. He makes a mental decision and turns in
          the direction of the gate. He lets go of his ROLL-AWAY.

</b>           And one of those lights, slightly
           brighter than the rest, will be my
           wingtip, passing over, blessing them.
