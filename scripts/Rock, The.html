<b>BEGIN MAIN 'TITLE SEQUENCE:
</b>
An impressionistic montage:

A SILHOUETTED MAN in front of mirror dons his Marine dress blues.  Spit
polish shoes laced.  Medals clipped to jacket.  All in CLOSE-UP.  We
never see him fully.

The Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head.  EYES glint.

On the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA.  Three Purple Hearts, photos
of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales.  TIGHTER
into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL
<b>COMBAT.
</b>


IMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will
never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the
screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be...



IMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN...  Now we are the coffin
as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND.

Now we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY.  Images of the cemetery are reflected
in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF
THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus



A1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES.  Suddenly AN EXPLOSION
and we see --

A MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here
sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the
communication ...



AII  CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S EYES and FADE IN:

<b>EXT.  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - MORNING
</b>
Two groundskeepers on "ride 'em" lawn mowers, BENNIE and MARLIN, smoke
Camels and watch the MARINE OFFICER from the opening montage.  He's
alone, across the cemetery.



<b>						BENNIE 
</b>		You'll get used to him.  Every Sunday morning - rain, snow,
		holidays nothin, keeps him Away.



<b>ACROSS THE CEMETERY
</b>
Brig.  Gen.  FRANCIS XAVIER HUMMEL stands before a headstone: BARBARA
<b>MCLEAN HUMMEL 1946-1996.
</b>


<b>						HUMMEL
</b>		Hi Barb.  The house sold yesterday.  I know, I know, the market's
		depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area.  Some things I have to
		do.  Things I couldn't do while you were here.  Maybe you would have
		approved.  Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything
		and I can't seem to get their attention.  But now they'll learn how it
		feels on the other side.  Let's hope it elevates their thinking.



Hummel puts new flowers on the grave.  Walks off.

<b>EXT.  ACCESS ROAD TO ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Heavy rain.  A road next to a heavily guarded bunker facility.  A canvas
covered ARMY TRUCK blows a tire in the road.  The DRIVER gets out. 
Inspects the tire.



<b>INT.  ARMY TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
FOUR MARINES in black suits dive through a hole in the truckbed floor
into a MANHOLE IN THE ROAD.



<b>EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT
</b>
Three ARMY M.P.s at the front GUARDHOUSE.  GENERAL HUMMEL pulls up in a
SUBURBAN.  The M.P.s immediately recognise him and stand more rigidly.



<b>					ARMY M. P. 
</b>		General Hummel, sir.  It's an honour. Is the Colonel
		expecting you, sir?



<b>					HUMMEL
</b>		Held better be.  This is a security inspection.



<b>					ARMY M. P.
</b>		Yes, sir!

The M.P. waves Hummel in, saluting crisply.

<b>INT.  GRATED STORM DRAIN IN BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
The four marines from the truck are waiting, readying arms.  The leader
is looking at his watch.  Gives a hand signal to the others, and up they
go --



<b>EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
The four marines emerge from the storm drain and move toward covered
positions in the compound.



200 YARDS AWAY - TWO ARMY "MAGAZINE CHECKERS" emerge from a building
with clipboards, on routine check.


<b>INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
The Army M.P.s escort General Hummel inside.  THREE ARMY GUARDS spring
up from their SURVEILLANCE MONITORS.  Everyone's nervous, in awe, rigid
at attention.  COLONEL CALLAHAN emerges from an adjacent room,
sleepy-eyed.



<b>					COLONEL CALLAHAN 
</b>		General Hummel!  This is a surprise!



<b>				HUMMEL 
</b>		That's the idea, Colonel.



<b>EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - WATCH TOWER - NIGHT
</b>
Two marines position themselves outside the door to the bunker
compound's elevated watch tower.



<b>â€¦EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Below the watch tower, the ARMY MAGAZINE CHECKERS approach.  Marines 1
and 2 spring out, armed with M-16s with over/under grenade launchers
They shoot BEAN BAG projectiles at the Army Guards, who collapse, dazed.



<b>INT.  BUNKER COMPOUND WATCH TOWER - NIGHT
</b>
Marines 3 and 4 burst inside the watch tower.  The guards inside spring
up.  BOOM BOOM, they're hit by bean bag projectiles, propelling them out
the windows of the watch tower.  They fall 10 feet and lie unconscious.



<b>EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Marines 1 and 2, now in MAGAZINE CHECYERIS UNIFORMS, move to the BUNKER
DOOR.  They open the door with the Magazine checker's CODED CARDS.



<b>INT.  CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - NIGHT
</b>
Two ARMY GUARDS, playing poker, look up at the entering marines. 
Marines 1 and 2 walk straight up to the Army Guards, holding them at bay
with M-16s.  Before any words are spoken, one of the marines injects
each of the guards with a VACCINE PISTOL.



<b>INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Four more marines led by SGT.  CRISP enter, holding Col. Callahan,
General Hummel and the Army Guards at bay.



<b>					SGT.  CRISP
</b>		This is a security exercise, sir. We've fully breached and
		infiltrated your compound.  I'm afraid you and your men are my
		prisoners, sir.

The marines begin cuffing the Army Guards to the radiator and taping
their mouths.



<b>					SGT.  CRISP 
</b>		Sorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.



<b>						HUMMEL 
</b>					(to Callahan) 
		Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there
		doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel.  Here
		you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator.  This is not a
		tight ship.  I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.



Sgt.  Crisp hits the FRONT GATE'S OPEN BUZZER and follows Hummel out of
the room.



<b>EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT
</b>
The gate swings open.  TWO HUMVEES enter the compound.

<b>EXT.  CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - NIGHT
</b>
The marines use a 'rabbit tool, (hydraulic, compact and powerful) to pry
open the bunker's steel doors.  They rush down a hallway.



CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - INTERIOR HALLWAY - The marines rush up to
another steel door and quickly pry it open.



<b>INT.  C.B.W. BUNKER - NIGHT
</b>
A refrigerated storage room for chemical weapons.  Storage tubes are
labelled: V.X. POISON GAS.  Across the room are rockets labelled: 55 115
<b>MM BOLT ROCKETS.
</b>


Using the TRACK HOOK SYSTEM in the bunker's ceiling, the marines move
the V.X. CHEM ROUNDS and BOLT ROCKETS to the waiting humvees.  It's very
fast, like clockwork.



<b>EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOLIND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT
</b>
The Humvees, followed by Hummel in his Suburban, roar out of the
compound.  CUT TQ:



<b>INT.  H " EL'S SUBURBAN - NIGHT
</b>
Hummel on a c.b. radio: A textbook exercise, gentlemen. Rendezvous in
eleven hours.


<b>EXT.  F.B.I. FIELD OFFICE, FT.  DIETRICK, MD. - DAY
</b>
Establish headquarters for chemical/biological weapons.

<b>INT.  F.B.I. OFFICE - CHEMICAL/BIOLOGIAL DIVISION - DAY
</b>
A WINDOWED DOOR stencilled "Chemical/Biological Weapons Division." A
RUBBER DART hits the glass and drops into A TRASH CAN next to the door.


<b>					ISHERWOOD
</b><b>					 (V.O.)
</b>		Son of a bitch...

<b>					GOODSPEED
</b><b>					 (V.O.) 
</b>		You owe me five dollars, Marvin.



ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL GOODSPEED, 30, and partner/trainee MARVIN
ISHERWOOD, 25, feet up on desks, with toy guns.  This is Man's Boredom. 
A ceiling fan circles.  Isherwood yawns; scratches neck with his gun
barrel.



GOODSPEED reloads.  Aims.  Fires.

THE DART hits A CARDBOARD TARGET across the room which activates a Rube
Goldberg series of events ending in a PLASTIC GIRL being ignited in a
<b>PAN OF CHEMICALS.
</b>


GOODSPEED, without even getting up, casually sprays the pan with flame
retardant foam.



<b>					ISHERWOOD
</b>					 (yawns) 
		I was told this was exciting work.



<b>					GOODSPEED 
</b>		Patience, Marvin.  It has its moments.



A KLAXON sounds.  Isherwood smiles excitedly.

<b>INT.  F.B.I. CHEMICAL WEAPONS - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
Isherwood follows Goodspeed down a grimy, off-white corridor illuminated
by antiseptic light.  This is an older building.  Hasn't been
refurbished and shows it.



<b>INT.  F.B.I. CHEMICAL WEAPONS - LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
A medium-sized laboratory, where 5 F.B.I. TECHNICIANS are bent over
tables of beakers, test-tubes, Bunsen burners, etc.  The room and
equipment are old and used; could be 1976 rather than 1996.



Along one side of the lab is a plexi-glass wall. Inside the plexi-glass
is an airlocked GAS CHAMBER. F.B.I chemists LONNER and LING motion to
Goodspeed.

<b>					DR. LONNER
</b>
		C'mere, Billy. 
			(points inside gas chamber) 
		A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian 
		refugee camp.  Could be detergent, could be seran gas.



INSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE next to a TABLE OF
<b>POISON DETECTION INSTRUMENTS.
</b>


<b>					ISHERWOOD 
</b>		Bosnian refugee camp?  I don't get it.



<b>					GOODSPEED 
</b>		Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians
		don't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out
		your hand.



Isherwood does so.  It's shaky.

<b>					ISHERWOOD 
</b>		I'm okay.  Really.  Let's do it-



Hold on Goodspeed's uncertain look, and CUT TO:

INT.  GAS C ER - DAY - MINUTES LATER The door HISSES open.  Goodspeed
and Isherwood, in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets, enter. 
They go to the INSTRUMENT TABLE before the crate.



A GLASS VESSEL with tiny air holes (like a salt shaker) descends from
the ceiling.  Inside are COCKROACHES. .



<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.



<b>						DR. LING
</b> 					  (into mike) 
		We have airlock, Bill.  Proceed.



<b>						GOODSPEED
</b>					(into helmet mike) 
		July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william
		Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a
		wooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside.



Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries
open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they
gingerly lift the lid.

INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with "UNICEF" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts
out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a
POISON SENSOR past each.



<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts
		out a sweatshirt) ... old clothes.


<b>						ISHERWOOD 
</b>		This is thrilling.


Isherwood lifts out a DOLL.  Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes
crazy... !


<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Careful, goddamn it Marvin!



The doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting
Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm.



OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked "exhaust" and
another marked "emergency."



A KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit.


IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST
FANS begin to suck it up.



IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and
explode, guts splattering the vessel walls.



<b>						ISHERWOOD 
</b>		What's hap...  what's happening....?



DR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel.

<b>						DR. LING 
</b>	Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear.  You're
	okay.



Goodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and
grabs A SCALPEL.  Cuts open the doll's chest.



<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		I've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news
		is the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits.



ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble
and corrode.



<b>						DR. LING 
</b>		What's the really bad news.



GOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES.

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas
		to kill everybody in the building.



Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting.

<b>						ISHERWOOD 
</b>		The acid's eating...  it's eating my fucking suit...



<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Chill, Marvin. 
					(yells outside) 
<b>		WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS?
</b>


Dr. Lonner flips on the sprinklers.  The pipes KNOCK.  A FEW PATHETIC
DROPS trickle from the SPRINKLER HEADS.



<b>						DR. LONNER 
</b>		Something's blocking the pipes, Bill.  When in Christ's name
		are they gonna give us a new building ...



<b>						DR. LING 
</b>		Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin.



Isherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several
6 inch needled SYRINGES.



<b>						DR. LING 
</b>		You die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it.
			(Goodspeed continues to inspect-the device)
		Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote.



Isherwood fumbles with a huge syringe.

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Get that away from me. 
				      (to himself)
		I hate needles.



<b>						DR. LING 
</b><b>		INJECT YOURSELF!
</b>

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b><b>		LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER?
</b>

The pipes are KNOCKING, now they're COUGHING.

<b>						DR. LONNER 
</b>		It's coming, it's coming ...


ISHERWOOD sinks to his knees, holding the huge syringe in front of his
heart, hari-kari style, hands trembling ...

GOODSPEED concentrates on the device; his calm is unsettling.  His hands
flash, grabbing instruments and performing precise, deft, functions.  He
snips a wire and splices it.  Another.  Another.



<b>						DR.  LING 
</b>						(sweating it out)
	Ten seconds, Bill.



Isherwood moves the syringe closer to his chest.

<b>						ISHERWOOD 
</b>		Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY
<b>		IT'S REAL.
</b>


ISHERWOOD drops the syringe.  Fumbles for another... GOODSPEED,
ice-cold, continues on the device ...



<b>						DR. LING 
</b>		Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ...



GOODSPEEDIS RUBBER GLOVE is stretched to transparency. we see
GOODSPEED'S FLESH through the acid-eaten rubber.  He makes one final
cut-and-clamp.  THE DETONATOR on the poison gas turns off.



<b>						DR. LING 
</b>		Three, two...  the gas is clear!



OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - GREEN LIGRTS FLASR on the control panel and A
TORRENTIAL SPRAY soaks GOODSPEED AND ISRERWOOD.  Isherwood is wide-eyed
and trembling.  Goodspeed glares at him.



<b>						DR. LING 				
</b>		Next time use the atropine!



<b>						GOODSPEED
</b>		I don't like needles.


<b>EXT.  GEORGETOWN - STREETS/ALLEYWAY - DAY
</b>
The bohemian part around Georgetown U. Goodspeed heads down an alley
between two townhouses.  LOUD COUNTRY MUSIC emanates from an apt. above.
Goodspeed ascends.



<b>INT.  GEORGETOWN - GOODSPEED'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
A young woman stands in the middle of the living room, belting out a
Carlene Carter tune in cowboy boots, rhinestone blouse and skirt.  CARLA
PESTALOZZI, 20's, is playing guitar, accompanied by a boom box.


<b>						CARLA 
</b>		Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing
		about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, (notices Goodspeed)
		Wanna keep you locked up at home ...


Goodspeed walks past her into the kitchen.  Carla turns down the music. 
Goodspeed re-enters with a Budweiser.


<b>						CARLA 
</b>				(New Jersey accent) 
		Hey there.



<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Hey honey.


<b>						CARLA 
</b>		Wrote a new song.  Wanna hear it?



Goodspeed sits heavily on the couch.  Rubs his temples. 

<b>						GOODSPEED
</b>		Not now.

<b>						CARLA 
</b>		Boy, somebody's in a bad mood.



<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood.



Carla changes the c.d.: A PUCCINI OPERA plays.

<b>						CARLA 
</b>		Better?

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Much better. She sits with him.  Puts her arm around him.

<b>						CARLA 
</b>		What happened baby.  Tell me.


<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Had a close one.

<b>						CARLA 
</b>		You want to talk about it?


<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Not really.

<b>						CARLA 
</b>		You know how I feel about what you do.

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Could we change the subject?

<b>						CARLA 
</b>		That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Hey!  Now there's some good news.

<b>						CARLA 
</b>		You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed
		for the Mona Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
						 (smiles) 
		I hope that's a compliment.  I could change my name.  How 'bout
		Bobby Sue Pestalozzi?  Billy io Pestalozzi?



<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Stick with Carla.

<b>						CARLA 
</b>		Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? 
				(GOODSPEED frowns) 
		Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.



<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down,
		inside and out ...



<b>						CARLA
</b>		Billy, this probably isn't the best time ...
		Bill, I'm uhhh.


<b>						CARLA 
</b>		I'm pregnant.



<b>						GOODSPEED
</b>
		You're what ... ?

She holds Up a positive home pregnancy test and CUT TO:

<b>EXT.  DESERT AREA (SOUTHWESTERN U.S.) - DAY
</b>
TWO = Y GUNSHIPS roar over camera and land next to the two Humvees.  The
Huey's doors open.  Marine Captains FRYE and DARROW, both late 20's,
drag out two MARINE LANCE CORPORALS, bound and gagged, and sit them
down.  Other marines roll gurneys laden with chem rounds, rockets and
other equipment onto the Hueys.

They Hueys ascend and SCREAM off across the desert and CUT TO:

<b>EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - AFTERNOON
</b>

Establishing shots of San Francisco and Alcatraz Island in the middle of
San Francisco Bay.


<b>EXT.  ALCATRAZ ISLAND - AFTERNOON
</b>
A PARK RANGER (JOE) leads a group of 80 TOURISTS across the prison
exercise yard.  In the background looms the city of San Francisco and
Golden Gate Bridge.



<b>						PARK RANGER JOE 
</b>		Alcatraz - "the Rock" - is the most famous, and was the
		most feared, prison ever built.  Here the inmates were allowed one hour
		of daily exercise.



<b>						FEMALE TOURIST 
</b>		Is it really true no one escaped?



<b>						PARK RANGER JOE 
</b>		True, madam.  From 1936 until the prison's closing in
		1963, there were fourteen attempts but no one's believed to have made
		it to shore - alive at least.



The tourists file off toward the MAIN CELL HOUSE.  Bringing up the rear
are Gen.  Hummel, Maj.  Baxter, Sgt.  Crisp, Capt.  Hendrix, and Pvts. 
Scarpetti,.  Royce, Gamble and Starling, all in civilian clothes.



Hummel motions to Crisp, who bleeds off with Scarpetti and Royce. 
Hummel and the others continue with the group.



<b>INT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</b>
Cell Blocks B and C, which inmates called "Broadway." A long corridor
with three tiers of cells on each side.



The Ranger leads the tourist group inside.

<b>					PARK RANGER JOE 
</b>		Al Capone; Machine Gun Kelly; Robert Stroud, the Birdman
		of Alcatraz; all lived in these cells.



The Ranger pulls the CELL DOOR OPEN/SHUT LEVER (recessed in the wall at
the end of cell block).  All the cell doors on the first floor slide
open.


<b>					PARK RANGER JOE 
</b>	Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the U.S. Park Service
	cordially invites you to become inmates of Alcatraz - temporarily of
	course.



The tourists laugh and move inside the cells.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - WHARF - AFTERNOON The side across from San Francisco. 
The TOURIST BOAT is docked in front of the U.S. PARK RANGERS' OFFICE.



Sgt.  Crisp and Pvts.  Scarpetti and Royce walk up to the Ranger's
office.  They look left and right, then enter.



<b>INT.  ALCATRAZ - U.S. PARK RANGERS OFFICE - AFTERNOON TWO PARK RANGERS
</b>and a SECRETARY look up.

<b>					ALCATRAZ PARK RANGER 
</b>		You're not supposed to leave the tour, guys.  Is
		there a problem?



<b>					SGT.  CRISP 
</b>		Big problem.

<b>INT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL BLOCK - AFTERNOON
</b>
The tourists are in the cells, looking around.  Park Ranger Joe notices
Hummel, Baxter, and the other marines standing behind him.  Smiles:

<b>					PARK RANGER JOE
</b>		Don't want to be locked up, fellahs?

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Not today.  You go ahead.

<b>					PARK RANGER JOE 
</b>		I don't think so hah hah.

Baxter draws a .45 and places it to Ranger ioe's head.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		I think so.

Startled, Park Ranger Joe backs into a cell.  Baxter grabs the cell door
open/shut lever and yanks it.  The cell doors CLANG shut.  Hummel,
Baxter and the others walk off.



<b>					TOURISTS 
</b>		Hey, what are you doing... ? -- wait a minute, what's going
		on... ?

<b>EXT.  ALCATRAZ - PARADE GROUND - AFTERNOON
</b>
Hummel and Baxter walk up to the PARADE GROUND as THE TWO HUEY GUNSHIPS
approach.  They hover above the parade ground.  Cpts.  Frye and Darrow
rope-deploy from the Hueys.  They stand at attention, saluting Hummel
and Baxter.

<b>					CAPTAIN FRYE 
</b>		General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Deploy as planned, Captain.

				(unison) 
		Aye, aye, sir.

<b>FRY AND DARROW
</b>
They hand signal to the Huey pilots.  The Hueys take off around the back
of the island.  
<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
A MONTAGE of short INTERCUT scenes, all AFTERNOON:

THE INFIRMARY, UPSTAIRS ROOM A former hospital room will be the command
and communications center.  PVTS.  GAMBLE and STARLING set up a portable
desk, chair, and an array of communications equipment (including

The tourists are now panicked, confused, and making a commotion. 
Shouting and yelling.  A woman is crying.

Suddenly a .45 is fired.  Total silence.  Hummel and Baxter, followed by
Pvts.  Gamble and Starling (pulling a gurney stacked with MARINE FIELD
RATIONS), walk to the middle of the cell block.

<b>						HUMMEL
</b>		Hello Ladies and Gentlemen.  You are my prisoners.  I have no intention
		of harming you.  You will be fed regularly.  That is all you need to
		know for now.

Gamble and Starling begin passing out the field rations. 53 INT. 
WASHINGTON D.C. - J. EDGAR HOOVER BUILDING - NIGHT F.B.I. Director JAMES
WOMACK exits his office in a tuxedo, trailed by MARGIE WOOD, a young
F.B.I. Agent.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Can it wait till morning, Agent Wood, I'm going
		to hear Bruce Springsteen ...


<b>						AGENT WOOD 
</b>				(re: Womack's tux) 
		In that?

<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Christ, the concert's for the Prince of Wales or
		somebody ...

<b>						AGENT WOOD 
</b>		I really think you should take this call personally.

They stare at each other and CUT TO: 54 INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - DIRECTOR
WOMACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT -- Womack, grabbing his phone. F.B.I. DIRECTOR
WOMACK F.B.I. Director Womack.

<b>						HUMMEL 
</b><b>							(V.O.) 
</b>		First:	I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on
		Alcatraz Island.  Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the
		media or there will not be eighty.  Second: fifteen guided rockets armed
		with V.X. poison, are currently aimed at the population of San
		Francisco.  I will call again at 0-hundred hours and state my demands.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Wait.  Who is this?

<b>						HUMMEL 
</b>		Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel.

CLICK.  Womack stares at the phone: calls to outer office:


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Mary Jane, get the Pentagon! (to Agent Wood) Call
		the San Francisco office.  It seems Alcatraz was just re-opened.

Agent wood gives him a curious look and CUT TO:

<b>INT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY/COMMAND CENTER - AFTERNOON
</b>
Cpts.  Hendrix, before Hummel.

Frye, and Darrow, and Sgt.  Crisp at attention Maj.  Baxter at Hummells
side.



<b>						HUMMEL 
</b>		At ease, Gentlemen.  It is traditional for me to meet with my
		officers before an operation.  The heart performs one thing, the legs
		another, the brain another - all better function together or the body
		becomes ill, is prone to disease. (beat) Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and I
		have been on the front lines since 'Nam.' Captain Hendrix was my
		adjutant in the Gulf.  Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a
		beatnik. 
			(the crew-cutted HENDRIX smiles Captain Frye, Captain Darrow.) 
		You and your men are new to me.


<b>						CAPTAIN FRYE 
</b>		Would the General like a recitation of our service records?


<b>						HUMMEL 
</b>		I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are
		excellent.  I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here.  You
		both stand to profit from this.


<b>					CAPTAIN FRYE 
</b>		Profit is not my motive, sir.  I am here to redress a
		wrong.


<b>					CAPTAIN DARROW 
</b>		Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.


<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain
		Darrow: They are called courts of law.  In the military, they are called
		Courts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned.  They
		are called schools.  Am I confusing you?


<b>					CAPTAIN DARROW 
</b>		Well, sir, frankly ...
		EL I see that I am ' 
						(beat)

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason. 
		Plain and simple.  An insurrection against a government to which we have
		sworn allegiance.  Everyone in this room must understand that.

Hummel looks from face to face, studying each.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		The question is what kind of traitor are we.  Coward or lion? 
		Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson?  I have posed that question to
		myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear.  Have all of you?



<b>					HUMMELS' OFFICERS 
</b>		Yes, sir.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not
		return.  All of you can live with that?

<b>					OTHER OFFICERS 
</b>						(unison) 
		Yes, sir.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Well, I cannot.  So, regardless of what happens on this island in
		the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances.

<b>					CAPTAIN HENDRIX 
</b>		But General, you'll be prosecuted.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Yes, Captain.  And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will
		make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason." Take
		your posts, gentlemen.  Semper fi.
<b>	
</b>Hummel's men fall out and exit.  Baxter, the last to exit, salutes
Hummel.

<b>INT.  PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Many people around a table, each with a DOSSIER on Hummel:

F.B.I. Director Womack (still in tuxedo), F.B.I. agent Margie Wood,
White House Chief of Staff HAYDEN SINCLAIR, National Security Advisor
LOUIS LINDSTROM, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs GENERAL ALBERT KRAMER, Air
Force General PETERSON, and C.I.A. Director MILTON AMWAY.



<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of
		a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets.  It wasn't
		discovered until the shift change this morning.


ON THE SCREEN - A YOUNGER HUMMEL in Vietnam.


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time.



MORE SLIDES OF HUMMEL in various international theaters.

<b>					HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>		Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm. 
		Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal
		of...  Jesus. 
					   	(looks up) 
		The man is a hero.



<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		A legend.  During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C.
		single-handedly.  Saved his whole company.  Hence the nickname
		"gunfighter."



<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam? 
		Anybody read it?


<b>					RAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>		No.  Give me the skinny.


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have
		either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting
		American lives.  I happen to share General Hummells view.



The door opens.  A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in.

<b>					NAVAL ATTACHE 
</b>		General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the
		table.

<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		Frank, this is Albert Kramer.


<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Hello Al.  Howlre Judy and the kids?


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		They're fine.  I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I.
		Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom,
		and C.I.A. Director Amway.  You've got a lot of people worried, Frank. 
		Can you help us out?


INTERCUT - PENTAGON and ALCATRAZ as necessary.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three
		Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. 
		Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ...


<b>					HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>		Southern China?  We never admitted we sent troops into
		China.

There is a pause.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Who is that.  Identify yourself.

Everyone stares at sinclair.

<b>					HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>		White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.



<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.



<b>					RAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>		I'm thirty-three.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday
		I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed
		that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat,
		ignorant mouth.  He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time.



Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again,
who hands him a phone and whispers:



<b>					NAVAL ATTACHE 
</b>		The President calling from Moscow.

Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking
sotto voice.


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		Continue Frank.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and
		El Salvador.  Remember the Gulf War.  Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures
		on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets.  Ten were left to rot outside
		Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu,
		gentlemen.  No benefits were paid to their families; no medals
		conferred.  These men died for their country and they weren't even given
		a coddamn military burial. 
					(beat) 
		This situation will not stand: you
		will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading
		Company" account to an account I designate.  From these funds,
		reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83
		marines, families.  The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's
		expenses.  Am I clear?


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is
		that?



<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Identify yourself.


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		F.B.I. Director Womack, General.



<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the
		Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.


<b>					WOMACK 
</b>					(stunned) 
		Is this true?

General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes.

<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney
		General and the boys down at Justice where it came from.  Good luck.


Hayden Sinclair returns to the table.


<b>					HAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>		General, I've just spoken to the President and he is
		clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care
		if ...


<b>					HUMMEL 
</b>		Someone please gag that man. 
					(beat) 
		Alert the media, I launch the gas.  Refuse payment, I launch the gas.
		It is just after midnight.  You have 36 hours - all of today and half
		of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money.  Don't even consider
		the standard counter measure, General.


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket
		armed with V.X., General Peterson?


<b>					GENERAL PETERSON 
</b>			In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...


<b>					RAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>		Well that's not so bad ...



<b>					I GENERAL PETERSON 
</b>		Thousand.  Seventy thousand.  Dead. one teaspoon will
		kill all living organisms in a three story office building.  Get the
		point?



<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		What did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General?

<b>					GENERAL PETERSON 
</b>		Napalm.  Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm.  
		It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation.  The problem is
		that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. 
		Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General.


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		'Course he does. 
					(explaining to others) 
		"Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still 
		in its test phase.  It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X. 
					(dawning on him) 
		That explains Hummells time frame.  He knows we're not
		operational.  What would it take, General?


<b>					GENERAL PETERSON 
</b>		To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36
		hours?  An act of God. 
					(off Kramer's look) 
		All right, we can try.  But
		view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		Then on to our primary initiative. (hits intercom button)
		Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. (to F.B.I. Womack) Who's your
		best chemical biological man?



<b>					AGENT WOOD 
</b>					(rises) 
		I'll find out.



<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
</b>		Tell him to pack a bag for San Francisco.



EXT.  GOODSPEED'S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT Tarpaper and gravel roof. 
Candles burning.  Loretta Lynnls "Stand by Your Man" on the boom box. 
AMONGST THE RUSTY SUPPORT SCAFFOLDS of an old sign from the 120's --



CARLA and GOODSPEED are, to put it delicately, madly passionately
athletically fucking.  Standing up.  They both have robes on.  A
CORDLESS PHONE RINGS.  Again.

<b>					CARLA 
</b>		Don't stop...  do no stop.

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Shit, shit, shit what time is it. 
					(fumbles for phone) 
		Hello.
					(pause) 
		I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.



GOODSPEED hangs up.  The couple stares at each other. Carla's seen this
look before ...


<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		I've got to go to San Francisco.


<b>					CARLA 
</b>		No. I'm sorry, but NO.  I need you here with me.  We need to talk
		about this...


<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't...  I
		cannot deal with this right now ... (softly) Bill, I am very Catholic. 
		And very pregnant.  And very unmarried.  Help me with this.


She turns away from him.  He pulls her back...


<b>					GOODSPEED 
</b>		I love you.  I will marry you.  I just didn't plan on this,
		that's all.  Tell you what: come to San Francisco.


<b>					CARLA 
</b>		Really? 
					(smiles) 
		Really?


<b>					GOODSPEED 
</b>		It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel,
		order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...


<b>					CARLA
</b>		... We'll finish what we started.  Baby, are you sexy in those
		boots ...


GOODSPEED walks off in COWBOY BOOTS, robe and boxers,..

INT.  PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT U.S.N. commander CHARLES
ANDERSON, 35, just the hardest looking man you've ever seen, stands
before the group.  Anderson is a Navy S.E.A.L., an Incursion Team
Leader.  Before Anderson are AERIAL RECON PHOTOS of Alcatraz.


<b>					COMMANDER ANDERSON
</b>		 A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. 
		Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might
		launch.  My second in command is working on an attack from within the
		prison. 
					(beat) 
		The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison,
		undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind -
		take their rocket positions without a shot fired.  But I need better
		intelligence.


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		You've studied the architectural plans.


<b>					COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		They're useless.  Alcatraz was originally a Civil War
		fort.  It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years.  Under there is a maze
		of shit, excuse my language. 
					(beat) 
		What I need is personal, firsthand
		intelligence on the island's tunnels.


CAMERA FOCUSES ON F.B.I. Director Womack, who gives a very significant
look to C.I.A. Director AMWAY.


<b>					GENERAL KRAMER 
</b>		The former warden?


<b>					AGENT WOOD 
</b>		Died in 1979.  The guards we contacted are useless.  There
		was a janitor, "Alcatraz Al". He worked there for twenty years, but he
		died in 1983.


<b>					GENERAL PETERSON 
</b>		Didn't three guys escape?  I thought I saw a movie about it.


<b>					AGENT WOOD 
</b>		It's a Hollywood myth.  No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived.


F.B.I. Director trades a very significant look with C.I.A. Director
AMWAY.  Amway clears his throat.  He is older, very old school. 
Everyone turns to him.


<b>					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
</b>		There is someone who can help us.


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		The C.I.A. Director and I have something to
		discuss in private.

Womack and Amway rise and exit together.  Everyone else sits there,
confused.

INT.  PENTAGON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT Womack and Amway exit into the
corridor.  They huddle tightly against the wall.  Sotto voice:      -


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		You're not actually suggesting ...

<b>					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
</b>		The man spent every night for six months making a
		dry-run of his escape.  He knows every inch of that island.  We have to,
		Jim.


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		I am very uncomfortable about this.


INT.  WOLFBURG PENITENTIARY - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT A long row of cells. 
CAMERA slowly DOLLIES past cell after cell.  Sullen INMATES stare
blankly at us ...



<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b><b>					(O.S.) 
</b>		I knew, I knew someday, this would come
		back to bite us.



CAMERA moves through a door marked "ISOLATION." At the end of a gloomy
corridor is a CAST-IRON DOOR.



<b>BACK TO THE PENTAGON CORRIDOR
</b>
<b>					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
</b>		it won't bite anyone - if handled correctly. 
		When was the last time you saw him?



<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		when he escaped from San Quentin.



<b>					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
</b>		The man was an S.A.S. trained killer.



<b>BACK TO WOLFBURG - IN THE ISOLATION CELL
</b>
TWO FEDERAL MARSHALS open the cell.'s steel locking bar.  They push open
the door.  Dark inside.  A MAN sits on the bed.

<b>					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
</b>		Can we risk letting.him out?

A SHAFT OF LIGHT cuts across the cell floor.

<b>					C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY 
</b>		The question is: can we not?

THE SHAFT OF LIGHT slices the face of JOHN PAUL MASON.  He is British,
at least once was, imprisoned without trial for 33 years on U.S. soil. 
For now, we have no idea why.



<b>EXT.  WASHINGTON D.C. - DULLES AIRPORT HANGAR - MIGHT
</b>
Raining.  An F.B.I GULFSTREAM 4 JET sits on the tarmac.

<b>EXT.  F.B.I. GULFSTREAM - NIGHT
</b>
F.B.I. Director Womack sits with FRANCIS REYNOLDS, 30, an Assistant U.S.
Attorney from the Justice Dept. GOODSPEED sits across the aisle.


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		I'm told you're our best chemical weapons man, Goodspeed.  
		What's your education?


<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		B.A. Columbia.  M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry
		and toxicology.


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Excellent.  What do you know about V.X. gas?

Pause. GOODSPEED stares at Womack.

<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		This isn't a training exercise, is it sir.


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		No Goodspeed.  It's not a training exercise.


HOLD ON GOODSPEED'S reaction, and CUT TO:

<b>EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - FEDERAL BUILDING - DAWN
</b>
Dawn breaks over San Francisoo.  A BLACK SEDAN and BLACK SUBURBANS pull
up to the F.B.I.'s West Coast office.  Goodspeed, Womack and Reynolds
get out, go inside.



<b>INT.  F.B.I. - OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING
</b>
We watch MASON being led into an INTERROGATION ROOM, his legs in irons,
his hands cuffed behind him.


'We are watching through a TWO-WAY MIRROR, and WIDEN TO: Womack,
Goodspeed, Reynolds and ERNEST SANCHEZ, S.F. Bureau Agent in Charge, are
watching Mason.  Sanchez is a gruff guy with the subtlety of a heart
attack.


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		The following is a state secret.  Disclose it to
		any party and you will be subject to prosecution.  His name is John
		Mason.  A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962,
		escaped in 1963.


<b>					AGENT SANCHEZ 
</b>		Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ...


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez.  Do not
		argue and do not question.  He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin,
		from which he escaped in February, 1976.  He's been held at Wolfburg
		since.  He has no identity.  He does not exist.  Understood? 
					(turns to Sanchez) 
		I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the
		route he took through the island's tunnels.


<b>					AGENT SANCHEZ 
</b>		You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?


<b>					F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Don't even entertain it.  This man laughs at
		strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either.


<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Why's he going to help us now?


<b>						U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS 
</b>						(hands Womack PARDON) 
		Mason's papers are in order, sir.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Because I'm willing to give him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon.



<b>						AGENT SANCHEZ 
</b>		Steep price for some information. (waves pardon away) I
		don't need that to get what you want.



<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Sanchez - try subtlety.

<b>						AGENT SANCHEZ 
</b>		It's my middle name. 
						(to Goodspeed)
		Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something.



Sanchez exits.



<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>						(grumbles)
		I ask for an interrogator and what do I get ...



IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON looks around.  He focuses on the
mirror.  He stares right through at GoodsDeed. GOODSPEED is fascinated, 
unnerved.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>						(to himself) 
		Jesus look at this guy.



INT.  F.B.I. - INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING Sanchez walks in, sipping
coffee.  Mason sits there, eyes forward.


<b>						SANCHEZ 
</b>		I'm F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge Sanchez.


Sanches sits.  Mason stares at the table.

<b>						MASON 
</b>		In charge of what?  Fucking me over for another three decades?



<b>						SANCHEZ 
</b>						(congenial) 
		Hey.  Easy.  I just want to talk.



<b>						MASON 
</b>		You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez?  Fucking Bloody Idiots. 
		I don't want to talk to you.



A pause.  Sanchez glares at Mason.

<b>						SANCHEZ 
</b>		Just some questions about Alcatraz.  It's a tourist attraction
		now.  You remember Alcatraz, Mason.

The word "Alcatraz" registers with Mason.


<b>						MASON 
</b>		Do I remember Alcatraz.

<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		Not the island itself.  The tunnels underneath it.


<b>IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Real subtle, SANCHEZ...


<b>IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>

<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		There's no harm in cooperating with us.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		Who's "us?" F.B.I.? C.I.A.? Why should I do that?


<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		Maybe there's a gift in it for you.



<b>						MASON  
</b>						(to the mirror) 
		Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.


<b>THE OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
GOODSPEED smiles slightly:

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."



<b>THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>
<b>						MASON  
</b>		Are you capable of reading, Sanchez?


SANCHEZ is getting flustered.


<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		I don't have time for this shit... 
						(pause; stares at mason) 
		Yes. I can read.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		The story of Alchimadus.  Know it?


<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		No.

<b>THE OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>						(to himself) 
		Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his
		king.

<b>THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>
<b>						MASON  
</b>		Thomas a Beckett.  Heard of him?


<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		Maybe.  Not really.

<b>THE OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>						(to himself) 
		Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and
		executed by Henry the Second ...



<b>THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>
<b>						MASON  
</b>		Solzhenitsyn.  I've a sneaking suspicion you've heard of him.



<b>THE OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>						(to himself)
		 Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.



<b>THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>
SANCHEZ draws a blank on Solzhenitsyn.

<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		Look, I'm asking the fucking questions here. 
						(beat) 
		You can trust the F.B.I.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		That's a good one, Sanchez.  What do you call and F.B.I. Agent who
		can't tell a lie?  A mute.


MASON  turns away.  As if SANCHEZ  
no longer exists. Suddenly, over a
wall-mounted INTERCOM:



<b>						U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS  
</b><b>						(V.O.) 
</b>		Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word
		with you?


<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail.


SANCHEZ tosses a quarter on the desk and exits.


<b>IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>

<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Impressive, Sanchez.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		You mind if...  uhm....  I take a shot?



<b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		He'll eat him alive.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		He's already had you for the first course. 
					(hands GOODSPEED the pardon)
		Go.


GOODSPEED takes the pardon, goes for the door.

<b>THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>
GOODSPEED enters.  He's completely out of his element, has no idea what
he's doing, and is-suddenly face-to-face with this.... MASON creature.


The two men regard each other.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Take his cuffs off.

The Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists.  MASON rubs his wrists, staring now
at Goodspeed.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa?



So much for Goodspeed's confidence.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed. 
						(rallys) 
		Mr. Mason, we really need your help.  That's a pardon and release 
		contract from the Attorney Generals office.  It makes you a free man,
		provided you cooperate.


He slides a ballpoint pen across to Mason.  MASON looks at the pen, then
Goodspeed.



<b>						MASON  
</b>		What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>						(lying) 
		I'm a field agent.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		Tell me what you really do.


<b>IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>

<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Don't answer that, GOODSPEED ....



<b>IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>
<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I'm a chemical biological weapons expert.



MASON registers this information.... 73 IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM F.B.I.
DIRECTOR WOMACK Stupid, stupid, stupid ....



<b>IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM MASON  
</b>stares at the pardon contract, thinking.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		You said I'd be a free man.  Define free


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Uhm, well, emancipated.  Unfettered.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		I know what the fucking word means, idiot.  In this context.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I don't understand....

<b>						MASON  
</b>		During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Well yes I suppose ...

<b>						MASON  
</b>		You suppose?

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Yes.  You'll be outside.

<b>IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Don't give away the farm, Goodspeed.



<b>IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>
<b>						MASON  
</b>		What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed?


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		A hostage situation.  A matter of life and death.


MASON thinks.  He picks up the pen.


<b>						MASON  
</b>						(looks at mirror) 
		Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in
		the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists.  I want a shower and a new
		suit of clothes.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I think we can arrange that.


With that MASON picks up the pen and signs the pardon contract.  He
hands it to Goodspeed, who exits.


MASON turns toward the mirror, staring right through.

<b>INT.  F.B.I. ~ OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY SANCHEZ  
</b>and GOODSPEED enter. 

GOODSPEED hands U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS the signed pardon contract.

<b>						
</b><b>						SANCHEZ  
</b>		Why didn't you throw in a trip to Fiji?


<b>						U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS  
</b>		I'll have this forwarded to the President,
		Director.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		No. You'll give it to me. 
						(pause) 
		Give it to me, Reynolds.


Reynolds reluctantly hands the pardon to Womack.

<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>							(to Sanchez) 
		Show Attorney Reynolds outside there's a car waiting for him.  And SANCHEZ - 
		I'll handle the next stage.


SANCHEZ leads the perturbed Reynolds out. GOODSPEED 
and Womack are alone now.  And WOMACK tears up the pardon

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Sir, that's a legal document.

<b>						
</b><b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		I'll decide what's legal, Goodspeed.

Over WOMACK'S SHOULDER, GOODSPEED 
<b>WATCHES AS --
</b>
<b>IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON
</b>
places THE QUARTER on the floor.  He raises his metal chair; SLAMS it
down on the quarter.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>Sir, those references to Alchimadus, Beckett, Solzhenitsyn:
all had something in common.

<b>IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON  
</b>picks up the coin.  It has a DEEP BURR
in it.  He moves to the mirror; begins carving into the glass.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		They were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong.  What's going
		on, sir?


GOODSPEED watches MASON over Womack's shoulder.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		You're out of your depth, Goodspeed.  You are on
		a need to know basis and you do not need to know.


MASON has etched a circle in the mirror.  He slams his elbow against it.
The glass caves in, CRASHES to the floor.


GOODSPEED and Womack whirl around, startled.  MASON  
leans into the observation room.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		one more thing: a shave and a haircut. 
						(sees Womack) 
		Hello Womack.


MASON and Womack stare at each other and CUT TO:

EXT.  MOJAVE - DESERT FLATS - MORNING A hot desert-vista.  Miles of
nowhere.  A DODGE sits under a tripod.  Suspended from the tripod, a
<b>BLINKING DEVICE.
</b>

The device DETONATES, showering the car with WHITE HOT BURNING LIQUID
and amazingly, the car melts into a pool of molten steel, disintegrating
to ash, which blows across the desert.


50 YARDS AWAY - U.S.A.F. LT.  JIMMY FISK and CPT.  LARRY GILER (both
late 20's) emerge from the heat waves in heat-refletive suits, walking
toward A HEAT PROTECTIVE BUNKER (a wall coated with heat reflective
metal.)

A van with no windows.  MASON is shackled to a steel loop at one end of
the seating bench.  GOODSPEED sits across from him, a CELLULAR PHONE at
his ear.


THREE F.B.I. AGENTS (CORD, STAR and HUNT) sit down the bench, talking
amongst themselves.


<b>						CARLA 
</b><b>						(V.O.) 
</b>						(recorded voice message) 
		Hi! Bill and Carla ain't in!

<b>						MASON

		Francisco?


GOODSPEED doesn't answer.  He notices the F.B.I. AGENTS staring at Mason
and him. He straightens up.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.

<b>						
</b><b>						MASON  
</b>		You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed?

The van STOPS: the rear doors open to the FAIRMONT HOTEL SERVICE
<b>ENTRANCE.
</b>
INT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY Top floor suite with a
private elevator.  Grand, with French doors leading to a balcony. 
Director Womack, GOODSPEED 
and F.B.I.Agents Star and Hunt are in the
room.  Jackets off, shoulder holsters on.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		I personally picked this suite. 
						(points at elevator) 
		Only one exit.


<b>IN THE SUITE'S BATHROOM
</b>
Steamy, from the shower.  F.B.I. Agent Cord sits on the sink.  MASON'S
VOICE emanates from the shower.  He's singing some ditty off-key.  But
MASON isn't washing.



INSIDE THE SHOWER STALL -- Mason's tampering with the BELL HOUSING of
THE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE on the shower wall.


MASON pops off the bell-housing. he pulls out the nylon clothesline cord
(it's thick, about 10 ft.) and rips it from the bell housing.  Tests its
strength.


Satisfied, he knots A NOOSE on one end of the clothesline cord, then
coils.


<b>IN THE BATHROOM - MASON  
</b>emerges from the shower wearing a huge hotel
bathrobe.


Cord hands him a SUIT OF CLOTHES.  MASON  
inspects them.


<b>						MARSHAL CORD 
</b>		Put 'em on.  You've got forty-five minutes.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		You going to stand there and watch?



<b>						MARSHAL CORD 
</b>		That's right.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		well if it excites-you ...



<b>						MARSHAL CORD 
</b>		Put the goddamn clothes on.



IN THE SUITE'S LIVING ROOM Womack is dumping the contents of a BARBER'S
BAG on the sideboard.

Hands THE HOTEL BARBER, a swishy guy, a COMB, ELECTRIC TRIMMER and BIB. 
The BARBER frowns.


<b>						BARBER 
</b>		I can't do a decent job with these.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		That's all you get.

<b>						BARBER 
</b>		I'm an artist, not a barber.

<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>						(holds up scissors) 
		without these he can't stab you in the throat.

MASON, dressed, emerges from the bathroom.  Motions the barber toward
the balcony.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		Shall we do this outside?  In the sunshine?

The barber gulps.  Follows MASON onto the balcony.

<b>ON THE SUITE'S BALCONY MASON  
</b>sits in the sun on a balcony chair.  Bib
on.

<b>						BARBER 
</b>		How would you like it sir?

<b>						MASON  
</b>		whatever's in style.

<b>						BARBER 
</b>		oh fabulous.  You look shabby.  Shall I snip and cut the
		shabbiness away?

The barber begins trimming Mason's hair...

THE BALCONY - SOME MINUTES LATER Mason's hair and beard are neatly
trimmed.  The barber holds a mirror up; MASON  
examines himself.



<b>						MASON  
</b>		Good.  Thank-you.

The barber stands.  Clears his throat.  Rubs his thumb and forefinger
together.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		Yes of course.  My secretary will take care of you.- 
						(to Agent Star)
		See to the good man will you?

Agent Star, glaring at Mason, leads the Barber out.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		What say we bury the hatchet, Womack.

MASON extends his hand.  Womack looks at it.  As Womack reluctantly
takes Mason's hand, MASON slides the noose over Womack's wrist.  He
yanks it tight and shoulders director womack bodily over the balustrade.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		In your head.

Womack plunges, HOWLING, 9 stories to his death.  No, he only falls 10
feet.  SPROOOOOING he stops, hanging by his wrist off the side of the
building, held there by --

<b>-- MASON  
</b>on the balcony, clutching the other end of the nylon
clothesline, staring at Goodspeed.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Jesus...  JESUS CHRIST....


GOODSPEED fumbles for his gun.  Finally unholsters it. DIRECTOR WOMACK,
hanging below, is SCREAMING.



<b>						MASON  
</b>		- Drop the gun or I'll drop your boss.



EXT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY Two F.B.I. AGENTS,
loitering by their vehicle, look up at WOMACK, dangling off the side of
the building.



<b>						F.B.I. AGENT 
</b>		Holy shit, we got a jumper.

		bolts from the balcony into the suitels library.

AGENT STAR sprints onto the balcony.  Star and GOODSPEED 
begin hauling Womack up as -- .

MASON steals through the suite, through the vestibule, and into the elevator.


ON THE BALCONY - Agent Star and GOODSPEED 
hoist Directory Womack, red-faced and sputtering, over the railing.  			
GOODSPEED grabs Star's walkie-talkie.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		All units, this is Caretaker.  WE'VE GOT A SIGNAL SIX. 
		Mason's in the elevator!  Let me know where he stops!



<b>INT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - BASEMENT - HOTEL KITCHEN - DAY

MASON exits the elevator.  The kitchen is bustling with COOKS AND
BUSBOYS.  MASON moves toward the side exit.  Two F.B.I. AGENTS enter. 
MASON ducks into the dishwashing room.  Waits for the Agents to run
past.



MASON emerges, running right into..... GOODSPEED.

WHAMM.  MASON'S FIST slams into Goodspeed's jaw. GOODSPEED 
goes down on the huge dishwasher.  MASON moves off quickly toward the side exit.



<b>EXT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - SIDE EXIT - DAY

the other cars.


EXT.  THE STREET AHEAD - DAY MASON'S HUMVEE plows through traffic,
hitting the left and right bumpers of the cars in front of it, knocking
them aside.  It blows through ten cars like ten-pins.


GOODSPEED'S FERRARI slaloms through the Humvee's wake of dented cars and
accelerates after the Humvee.


TWO POLICE PATROLMEN scramble into their cruisers, throwing on the
<b>CHERRY TOP LIGHTS.
</b>

The CRUISERS charge after the Humvee and the Ferrari.

INT.  S.F. POLICE CRUISER - DAY Two S.F. PATROLMEN.  Their eyes widen
too as -- THE SPARKLETTS BOTTLES are bouncing now, roll down on them at
45 m.p.h. A BOTTLE SMASHES through the windshield, showering the
Patrolmen with glass.



EXT.  SAN FPANCISCO STPEETS - (MIDWAY UP HILL #1) - DAY Chaos.  Bottle

of the hill.

EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - (BOTTOM OF HILL #2) - DAY At the
intersection here, TWO S.F. ROAD WORKERS are sliding a STEEL PLATE over
a 6 ft. deep ditch cut in the asphalt (for a water main or equivalent).


The Road Workers, hearing the WAIL OF MASON'S HUMVEE, look up and dive
away just at THE HUMVEE blasts over he steel plate, dislodging it from
its positioning.  It TEETERS on the lip of the ditch.


THE F.B.I. SEDAN hits the teetering steel plate, which collapses --
causing the sedan to be swallowed up halfway into the ditch, it's rear
end sticking up in the air.  Seconds pass, then --


THE SECOND F.B.I. SEDAN SLAMS into the frontrunning SEDAN'S..EXPOSED
UNDERCARRIAGE.  Both vehicles are obliterated.


GOODSPEED'S FERRARI, in the most hair-raising slide ever filmed, veers
and misses the mangled F.B.I. sedans.


Now it's just MASON and GOODSPEED and CUT TO:

<b>EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - (TOP OF HILL #3) - DAY
</b>

MASON'S HUMVEE, with GOODSPEED'S FERRARI close behind, races down a
street on the crest of a hill.

IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD - A CABLE CAR is turning down the hill. 
Mason's Humvee also turns down the hill, but as the Humvee rounds the
corner --

AN OLD WOMAN starts crossing the street.  MASON  throws the wheel
swerving to avoid her, and --


-- THE HUMVEEIS BUMPER catches the BACK OF THE CABLE CAR, dislodging its
rear steel wheels from the CABLE CAR TPACKS.  With the front wheels
still lodged in the tracks, the cable car becrins to slide sideways.


GOODSPEED'S FERRARI clears the cable car's sliding back end and sprints
after Mason's Humvee.



<b>EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - MIDWAY DOWN HILL #3 - DAY
</b>
the Humvee and Ferrari blast down the hill.  The street is thick with
vehicular traffic.


So THE HUMVEE swerves, leaving the street.

onto the sidewalk.  Where... SNAP SNAP SNAP it knocks down every parking
meter, then hits A LADDER in a cordoned off area.  On the ladder, a
LINEMAN is fixing a MUNICIPAL POWER LINE.  The ladder collapses; THE
LINEMAN falls, flailing through the air.


GOODSPEED slams on the brakes.  The Ferrari spins 180 degrees and
lurches to a stop facing uphill.


INT.  GOODSPEED'S FERRARI - DAY THE AIR BAG'S exploded in Goodspeed's
face. 
<b>						GOODSPEED 
</b>		Shit shit SHIT SHIT ...



<b>EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - MIDWAY DOWN HILL #3 - DAY
</b>
GOODSPEED looks up the hill.  GOODSPEED'S EYES bug.

GOODSPEED'S POV - THE CABLE CAR is still sliding down the hill sideways.


THE SLIDING CABLE CAR, its wheels SPEWING SPARKS down the hill.  The
LAST PASSENGER dives. it's now empty and sliding straight for
Goodspeed's Ferrari ...


<b>INT.  GOODSPEED'S FERRARI - DAY
</b>
GOODSPEED grabs the Ferrarils CELLULAR PHONE and tries the door latch. 
The goddamn airbac is all over him.... So GOODSPEED 
shoots the fucking air bag.


<b>EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - (BOTTOM OF HILL 33) - DAY
</b>
THE TUMBLING CABLE CAR hits the Toyotals rear.  The Toyotals gas tank
EXPLODES, lifting the cable car.


The Ferrarils door flies open. GOODSPEED dives away as --

-- THE CABLE CAR, aflame, cartwheels in mid-air and lands with a WHUMP
on the FERRARI, crushing it like a tin-can.



GOODSPEED, dazed, wheels away from the wreck, shielding his eyes from
the smoke and fire.

A YOUNG KID ON A MOTORCYCLE rolls up.


MOTORCYCLE KID You just fucked up your Ferrari, man.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		It's not mine.

<b>						MOTORCYCLE KID 
</b>		Way cool. 
						(smiles)

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Neither is this.


GOODSPEED shoves the kid off the Motorcycle.  Speeds off into traffic. 
The kid stands there dumbstruck.

</b>
Goodspeed, driving through traffic on the kid,s motorcycle, flips open
the cell phone.  Punches numbers.

GOODSPEED ROARS off on the motorcycle and CUT TO:

EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - 32 STENSON DRIVE - DAY A single family house. 
Across the street --

GOODSPEED watches the house.  The door opens.  JADE ANGELOU exits. 
She's 19, tall, pretty, purposeful.


<b>EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - PIAZZA DES ARTES - DAY MASON  
</b>stands next to a massive column, writing on a piece of paper: 
<b>"ST.  MICHAEL'S CHURCH, FORT WALTON, KANSAS.  FRONT PEW.  RIGHT LEG.  HOLLOW."
</b>

ACROSS THE PARK - JADE ANGELOU enters a city park with a rotunda of
classical design.  A walk-way under massive Corinthian columns.  She
moves through the rotunda.


MASON  sees her.  He steps behind the column as she passes. There is a
moment of indecision.  MASON looks at THE PIECE OF PAPER in his hand.



<b>						MASON  
</b>		Jade.


Jade Angelou stops cold.  Slow-ly turns.  And regards Mason.


ACROSS THE ROTUNDA - GOODSPEED sees MASON  and Jade. he stealthily moves
toward them.



BY THE COLUMN - MASON AND JADE Jade approaches MASON  
tentatively.  He is stunned by her. By her beauty, her bearing, her 
likeness to'him.



<b>						MASON  
</b>		Hello.  Yes.  It's me.



<b>						JADE 
</b>		I uhm...  I'm not quite sure what to say. This is all a bit much
<b>		...
</b>

Several POLICE CARS ROAR past, sirens BLARING.  MASON  
pockets the PIECE
<b>OF PAPER.
</b>

<b>						MASON  
</b>		Let's uhm...  let's walk a ways.


They walk off next to a TALL HEDGE. GOODSPEED 
follows on the other side of the hedge.  INTERCUT between MASON  
and Jade, and Goodspeed eavesdropping. GOODSPEED 
pulls out his cellular phone, begins punching numbers.


<b>						JADE 
</b>		So  how long have you been out?

<b>						MASON  
</b>		A while.

<b>						JADE 
</b>		A while.  And you didn't call?  You are free now, right?


<b>						MASON  
</b>		I'm here with you, aren't I?

<b>						JADE 
</b>		Why now?  I mean why today.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		I was driving through San Francisco.  I decided it was time.


<b>						JADE 
</b>		Well there's not a lot I know about you other than you escaped from
		San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and I'm the result. 
		You can imagine I'm pretty confused.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		I tried to explain in my letters.
<b>	
</b>
<b>						JADE 
</b>		Ahh.  Your letters.  They weren't very easy to follow.


She fishes in her pocket.  Pulls out A LETTER.  WHOLE SECTIONS OF THE
LETTER have been scissored out.  Mason. frowns.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		I see. 
						(grumbles) 
		Bloody prison censors.


<b>						JADE 
</b>		How about explaining now?


In the b.g. we HEAR POLICE SIRENS.  MASON  
looks around.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		Maybe this isn't the best time... 
						(off her look) 
		Jade.  Here sitdown.


MASON and Jade sit on a bench.  MORE SIRENS in the b.9. MASON  
looks off
nervously.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		All will be explained.  You must trust me on this. Someday very soon, 
		after I get a few things settled, I will come back for you.  What I 
		need to know is: do you want me in your life?


<b>						JADE 
</b>		How can I answer that?  I don't know if we can.... after 19 years,
		just start like that.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		We are the same blood.


<b>						JADE 
</b>		But I don't know you.


<b>						MASON 
</b>		where to begin. 
						(sighs) 
		My name is John Paul Mason.  I'm Scottish.
		I attended Dartmouth Naval College.  My favorite color is green.  I
		like books.  I like a good joke.  At one time I shot a pretty fair round
		of golf.  I'm in my 60's and I've been in jail half my life. 
						(Jade looks away) 
		Maybe it's better I go.

She smiles.  Puts her hands on his.

<b>						JADE 
</b>		No. You're doing okay.


Police sirens BLARE.  And the entire park.is suddenly surrounded by
<b>F.B.I. AND POLICE VEHICLES.
</b>

<b>						JADE 
</b>		You lied to me.


GOODSPEED approaches.  MASON makes no attempt to move.  Jade turns to
him.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>						(flashes his I.D.) 
		F.B.I. miss.  Your father is working with us.  He's helping us resolve a.... 
						(looks at Mason)
		.... dangerous situation.


<b>						JADE 
</b>		He is?


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Yes madam.  We've got to go, John.

MASON  extends his hand to Jade.  She takes it.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		Jade - remember what I said.


They hug.  Then MASON walks off with GOODSPEED and --

-- Jade opens her hand, revealing the PIECE OF PAPER upon which Mason
wrote his instructions.


ACROSS THE PARK - F.B.I. AGENTS STAR and CORD run up.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>						(sharply) 
		No cuffs until we get to the cars,


They continue toward the waiting cars.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		You surprise me, Goodspeed.  Now I'm going to surprise myself:
		thank-you, you could have handled that differently.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>						(tight) 
		You almost got me killed.  Twice.



<b>						MASON  
</b>		Hows your jaw?


GOODSPEED wheels on MASON and swings.  SNATCH.  MASON  
catches Goodspeed's fist.  Three inches from his face.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		It hurts.


SANCHEZ, DIRECTOR WOMACK and the F.B.I. AGENTS approach. Womack's arm is
in a sling; he's in a volcanic rage.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		You cocksucker you dislocated my shoulder and
		cost the city of San Francisco ten million dollars.  You try to escape
		again and Agent Chaney here will break your legs.


AGENT CHANEY, large and mean, comes to Mason's side.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		Pleased to meet you.

INT.  PIER 39 - F.B.I. COMMAND CENTER - DAY Night is falling.  A large
warehouse room with windows looking out to Alcatraz Island.  Looks like
<b>N.A.S.A.
</b>
<b>AT A RECTANGULAR TABLE - MASON  
</b>sits at the head of the table 122 in
front of a SCALE MODEL OF ALCATRAZ.  COMMANDER ANDERSON and ten NAVY
S.E.A.L.s look toward Mason.

Anderson is agitated, staring at Mason.


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Okay, one more time: down this second fork
		fifty-seven paces to a septic chamber.  Turn left at the water pump,
		then forty-two paces to the prison showers ...


<b>						MASON  
</b>		No. Forty-two paces to the septic chamber.  Fifty-seven to the
		showers.



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>						(pointedly) 
		That's not what you said three minutes
		ago.



<b>						MASON  
</b>						(innocently) 
		It's not?


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>					(dagger stare at Mason)
		Excuse me. 
						(rises)
		Womack.


Womack follows Anderson aside.  They confer heatedly.


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's
		tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play "twenty
		questions."


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		He knows every inch of those tunnels, Commander.



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Then he's keeping it to himself.  He's fucking with
		me and I don't have the time.



<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>						(pause; he thinks) 
		What if he went with you?



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Out of the question.  He'll endanger the mission -
		he'll endanger my men.  He's a security risk.  Who says he won't bolt as
		soon as we turn our backs on him?

<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		I'll handle that.  Chaney.

The hulking Chaney escorts MASON over.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		You're not cooperating, John.  Maybe this will
		help.  I'm sure you're curious about what's happening on Alcatraz. 
						(no response) 
		Twelve United States Marines - a terrorist rogue force - have
		seized it.  They've aimed fifteen poison gas rockets at the city. 
		Enough poison gas to kill every man, woman and child in San Francisco.
						(smiles) 
		Yes, John, including your daughter.


<b>						MASON  
</b>	You son-of-fucking-Satan.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOA WOMACK 
</b>		Mr. MASON has a strong incentive to help us,
		Commander Anderson.


MASON boils.  Then springs at Womack.  Chaney grabs Mason, headlocking
him.  So MASON  knees Womack in the balls.  Womack doubles over. 
Recovers, coughing.


<b>						F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>		Get him some gear.  He's going to the Rock. 
		Goodspeed!


<b>ACROSS THE ROOM - GOODSPEED

3-D images of different angles of a V.X. ROCKET.  He walks over to the
table.  Anderson and the other S.E.A.L.s stare at him.


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		The goal is to take out the launchers and neutralize
		the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed.  Tell us what you know.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas. 
		Here.  The prison morgue. 
						(points)
		It's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense.  V.X. gas 
		begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		No sir, but I've studied them ....



<b>						COMMANDER  ANDERSON 
</b>						(sarcastic) 
		That's great, Goodspeed.  You're in the
		Bureau, so you've had weapons training.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		A little, sir.


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		So you've never been in a combat situation.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		No sir. 
						(beat) 
		Should I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Won't be necessary.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Sir, these are very complicated devices...


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		I know they are, Goodspeed.  That's why you're going
		with us.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Sir?


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>						(to S.E.A.L. Reigert)
		Get him some gear.

MASON stares at Goodspeed.

<b>						MASON  
</b>		Wait just a minute.  This little twat's going to deal with the

MASON walks off muttering.

S.E.A.L. Dando stands at a urinal. GOODSPEED bursts in and lunges for

</b>		You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill,

</b>		Chemical Weapons isn't a cakewalk, Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED splashes cold water on his face.

The move across the staging area to --

A CH-53 SEA STALLION and two HUEY COBRA ATTACK GUNSHIPS, their BLADES
whipping with ferocity.


S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD stands in the Sea Stallion's door.  The S.E.A.L.s

The S.E.A.L.s begin to don their scuba apparatus.


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		You know what you're doing?


<b>						MASON  
</b>		Yes.  Little fancier than I'm used to.


MASON examines the equipment.  It's more modern, but not foreign to him.
 He adjusts his depth and oxygen gauges.  Goodspeed, having a hard time,
watches Mason.

The S.E.A.L.s stand.  Each checks the gear of the man in front of him. 
Straps tightened.  Weapons checked. -

IN THE REAR OF THE HOLD-- FOUR S.E.A.L.s ready two high-tech 139B 3-man
submersibles called 'IS.D.U.sll (Seal Delivery Units), also known as
"Seal Subs."


MASON is ready to go, calm and steady, eyes forward. GOODSPEED'S still
behind.  He has his scuba tanks shouldered, but he can't get the 
lst of the tricky cATcHEs on the shoulder harness secured ...

MASON reaches over and secures, with a METALLIC DLINK, the catch. 
Goodspeed, embarrassed, nods.


<b>AT THE BACK OF THE HOLD
</b>
139F SHEPHERD, with a nod, directs MASON  
to sit down on the S.D.U.
behind S.E.A.L. BOYER, the S.D.U.ls driver.


MASON does so.  Chaney then sits behind Mason.  S.E.A.L. Dando then
begins buckling Shepherd and MASON  
onto the sled with harnesses (the unit's version of a seat-belt.)

sits on the SECOND S.D.U. behind S.E.A.L. REIGERT.  S.E.A.L. Dando begins 
buckling in Goodspeed.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Wait a minute.
						(Dando stops buckling) 
		What if this thing crashes ...


Dando looks at Reigert.  They laugh.  This remark they
obviously find very funny.  Dando continues buckling GOODSPEED 
in.


<b>						MASON  
</b>		Smile Goodspeed.  Live a little.  Life is short...  especially
		yours.


And the S.D.U.ls are released, rolling out of the Sea Stallion on a set

Hummel raises binoculars.  Scans the bay.

HUMMEL'S POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE HUEYS AND SEA STALLION, flying
low, SCREAM toward the island.


BACK TO SCENE - HUMMEL lowers the binoculars, clicks on his
walkie-talkie.

CLOSE-UP on BOYER, the three-man S.D.U.ls driver, intense, determined.
CLOSE-UP on Boyer's fluorescent green INSTRUMENT PANEL charting their
approach to the island.


They've drawn close to the island.  ' COMMANDER ANDERS6N swings an
UNDERWATER SPOTLIGHT, which reveals --


A LARGE WATER INTAKE PIPE jutting out from the Island's bedrock, 7 ft.
in diameter, covered by a GRATE thick with rust, barnacles and seaweed. 
There's a SMALL JAGGED HOLE, presumably through which MASON  
escaped 33
years earlier.

WOODEN CISTERN in the middle.



The S.E.A.L.s emerge in the cistern and climb out.  The room . has one
exit, sealed with a HEAVY IRON door.



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us
		to a room with no exit.



<b>						S.E.A.L. BOYER

</b>						(points)
		Under there.


UNDERNEATH THE STEAM ENGINE is a tiny crawl space. 10 STEAM RELEASE
VALVES periodically emit BURSTS OF STEAM.


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		You are shitting me.  You catch one of those steam
		bursts and you're a corpse.



<b>						MASON  
</b>		True. 
				(unshoulders his equipment)
		I memorized their timing.


MASON sits on the edge of the crawl space.  F.B.I. looks inside the
crawl space: WHITE HOT BURSTS of 500 degree Fahrenheit steam BLAST DOWN.



<b>						S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD 
</b>		Uhh sir, you said never leave his side ...



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		You're not required to follow, Lieutenant Shepherd. 
		This man is going to die.

BURST another evolution STEAM BURST another revolution STEAM BURST


MASON  rolls to a stop on his side.  STEAM BURSTS on either side of him.

are precise, from memory.  He rolls past.each burst, any imprecision
certain death ...

</b>		Welcome to the Rock.

The Incursion Team files through the door and CUT TO:

INT.  TUNNELS UNDER ALCATRAZ - NIGHT Here, the tunnel moves up a steep
incline to a LOCKED STEEL BULKHEAD.  S.E.A.L.s REIGERT and DANDO check
it out.



<b>						S.E.A.L. DANDO 
</b>		She's at least three inches thick sir.



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Shit.  Burn it.

Dando unpacks an ACETYLENE TORCH.  Reigert turns on the ACETYLENE VALVES
(tanks rigged to Dandols gear) and sparks the torch.  IT FLAMES UP,
white hot.


Dando starts toward the bulkhead.  MASON steps past him, bending his
KITCHEN FORK into an awkward shape.  He fishes the fork in the lock;
twists it, and...... POP.


MASON  throws open the thick bulkhead door.  And climbs through the
bulkhead.


<b>						MASON  
</b>						(muttering) 
		Guys are worthless.

<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Who is this guy... ?

INT.  DRAINAGE PIPES LTNDER MAIN CELL HOUSE - NIGHT The team arrives at

						(MASON nods yes) 
		After you.



MASON and the S.E.A.L.s climb into the drainage pipe.

INT.  DRAINAGE PIPE UNDER SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT The S.E.A.L. team, Mason
leading the way, climbs toward a FAINT LIGHT emanating from a DRAINAGE
GRATE above.


S.E.A.L. REIGERT readies a FIBRE OPTIC SEEING DEVICE; he pushes the
fibre-optic camera up through the grate.

something of interest ~-

A MOTION DETECTOR (a blue beam flashed from a transmitter to 161A a
receptor) across the grate.



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Motion sensor.

Anderson gingerly lifts the grate.  Reigert wiggles his hands past the
edges of the grate and nudges the beam transmitter (with one hand) and
the beam receiver (with the other) away from the grate.



<b>INT.  INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
</b>
A SILENT ALARM next to Pvt.  Royce blinks on.  Royce turns to Maj. 
Baxter.



<b>						ROYCE  
</b>		Sir.  Anti-disturbance temblar tripped in the shower.  We got

The grate pops open.  S.E.A.IL.s BOYER and REIGERT, wearing NIOHT VISION
GLASSES, emerge taking defensive positions back-to-back.  Commander
Anderson follows.  Then, one by one, the rest of the S.E.A.L.s emerge.



<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>			(to Lt.  Shepherd in the drainage pipe) 
		Stand fast. We'll secure the area.



ANDERSON directs Boyer and Reigert to a TILED COLUMN.  They creep across
the tiled floor, taking "check and defefid" positions behind the
shower's TILED COLUMNS.  But suddenly, shockingly.....FLOODLIGHTS flash
on.  Coming from the mezzanine above.


The S.E.A.L.s whip off their night vision goggles.

The S.E.A.L.s, terrified, hesitate but do not drop their weapons They
stand back-to-back, weapons trained at the catwalk. squinting into the
white light.


The S.E.A.L.s behind the tiled columns take cover. we cannot yet see
Hummel and the marines.  This plays with as much tension as possible. 
The situation is chilling:

HUMMEL looks down at the S.E.A.L.s. Baxter's text to him.  The other
marines are at positions around the mezzanine perimeter, M-16's trained
and ready.

<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		Sir, we know why you're out here.  God knows I agree
		with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to defend this country against
		all enemies.  Foreign, sir, and domestic. (shouts now) General, we've

</b>		Don't do anything stupid, Commander. No one has to die here.


<b>						COMMANDER ANDERSON 
</b>		You men following the General: You are United States
		Marines and under oath you forgotten that?  We all have shipmates we
		remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that
		doesn't give you the right to mutiny.



<b>						HUMMEL 
</b>		That's a nice speech, Commander.  I heard plenty like it in the
		Pentagon and on Capitol Hill.  They all added up to zero.  Pretty words
		aren't gonna get you out of this, Commander.  Now abort this mission. 
		Goddamn it, abort.


BEHIND THE COLUMN - S.E.A.L. BOYER, just 20, having never seen combat,
is trembling with fear, indecision.


<b>						S.E.A.L. BOYER 
</b>		It's us or them, Reigert, fuck they're gonna waste us ...

<b>						S.E.A.L. REIGERT 
</b>		Get a grip on yourself ....

ON THE MEZZANINE - PVT.  COXIS BOOT nudges a TILE which has come loose
from its mortar.  The tile inches to the edge of the mezzanine.  Then it
falls ......


BOYER, reacting to THE FALLING TILE, brings up his machine gun and fires
A SUSTAINED BURST in its direction --


And all hell breaks loose.  THE MARINES fire in unison.  A cruel
withering fusillade.


--- THE S.E.A.L.s in the middle of the floor take the brunt of it. They
gamely return fire.  But they're hit.  Again.  Again.  Again.


IN THE DRAINAGE HOLE - Goodspeed, Mason, and Lt.  Shepherd listen (and
watch, when the view allows) in utter horror to the firefight above.


Lt. Shepherd scrambles up the ladder. GOODSPEED 
grabs him. Tries to pull him down.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Don' t do it.


<b>						S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD 
</b>		Let go of me.


Lt.  Shepherd climbs the ladder.

IN THE SHOWER ROOM - ANDERSON takes a bullet in his leg.  His automatic
blazing, he takes a bullet in the forearm.  The chest.  The shoulder.

-- THREE MARINES on the mezzanine are hit and killed.

-- LT.  SHEPHERD climbs out of the drainage pipe and comes up firing. 
He instantly takes a bullet through the visor, killing him instantly.

Goodspeed, indecisive at first, clambers down after Mason.

MASON walks off.  Suddenly stops.  THE SATCHEL EXPLOSIVE has fallen at
his feet.  MASON turns, looks at Goodspeed.  And they sprint back, the
way they came.

IN THE TUNNEL BEHIND THEM - A MONSTROUS EXPLOSION blows in the tunnel
and knocks MASON  and GOODSPEED to their feet.

The fire is looking for an escape, hunting and burning everything in its
path.

toward them.  MASON  
grabs Goodspeed.

They dive into a pool of stagnant water, submersing as the WALL OF FLAME
blows through the tunnel over their heads.


Mason, then Goodspeed, drags himself out of the water.

</b>		Come on.  And keep your mouth shut.

MASON  hurries off, GOODSPEED on his tail.



<b>EXT.  ALCATRAZ - SUBTERRANEAN CIVIL WAR RUINS - NIGHT

</b>		Now what?

MASON moves to the bricked-up wall.  Feels around the mortar.  Smiles. 
Removes a brick. another.  Another.  A WHOLE CLUMP of bricks falls,
revealing A HOLE.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		Came out right through there. (squeezes through the hole; mutters)
		'Course I've gained a few since ...



GOODSPEED follows MASON through the hole.

It's about 3 ft. deep.

</b>		Across that, then 50 yards to the morgue. 
			(off Goodspeed's blank stare) 
		You said that's where the fucking poison is, Goodspeed.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I don't get it.  You're going to help me?

</b>		No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		All right, all right.  Don't call me idiot, okay?



MASON what did I do to deserve this?  What God did I offend .....



GOODSPEED begins to wade into the pool.

<b>MASON  
</b>Stop. 
(GOODSPEED stops) 
There.  And there.



GOODSPEED squints.  The water slithers with COTTONMOUTHS. MASON  
unpack the QUART OF MOTOR OIL in spray bottle.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		Cottonmouth snakes.  They breath through their skin.  Oil clogs
		it.  They hate the stuff.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		sprays the motor oil across the pool.  The snakes scatter.  The
		pool's now coated with an OIL SLICK.  MASON  
		wades in.  Goodspeed follows.



The COTTONMOUTHS, repulsed by the oil, stay away. GOODSPEED 
tries not to look at the snakes.  They make it across.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Something's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're
		the convict, and you have all the guns.



MASON slaps the .9 MM pistol into Goodspeed's hand walks off. 
GOODSPEED follows.



<b>INT.  ALCATRAZ - TUNNEL UNDER PRISON MORGUE - NIGHT

MASON  and GOODSPEED 
arrive at a fork in the tunnel. _

DOWN THE FORK IN THE TUNNEL - is the PRISON MONO-RAIL SYSTEM: a single
rail suspended from the tunnel ceiling, upon which SMALL CARTS are
suspended.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		The morgue?



MASON  nods.  Moves to a STEEL-RUNGED LADDER leading to a GARBAGE CHUTE
against the wall.  			GOODSPEED 
follows.


<b>INT.  ROOM ADJACENT TO MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
MASON and GOODSPEED emerge from the garbage chute.  They hear VOICES in
the next room.

<b>INT.  MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
PVTS.  GAMBLE and STARLING are guarding the poison. Starling's walking
around.  Gamble's seated on a MORTICIANIS TABLE, smoking.


The door bursts open.  MASON stands in the doorway.  GAMBLE dives away. 
STARLING whirls, raising his M-16.


MASON'S HAND flashes.  THE SAW-TOOTHED KNIFE flies the length of the
room and buries in Starling's neck.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		Never hesitate.

Gamble fires from his position around the corner.  MASON and Goodspeed
dive for cover behind a cabinet. GOODSPEED fires from cover without
looking, his gun raised over the cabinet.  Mason, underneath the
cabinet, fires at GAMBLE'S FOOT.  Gamble, shot, hits the deck.



GAMBLE unclips a GRENADE.  Before he can pull the pin....

MASON FIRES HIS CLIP EMPTY at the AIR CONDITIONER MOUNT on the ceiling
above Gamble.  The mount gives; the ENORMOUS AIR CONDITIONER falls,
crushing Gamble.  Gamble's GRENADE, still secured with the pin, rolls
away.



GOODSPEED rises.  Looks at Gamble under the air conditioner.  Just HIS
LEGS stick out. (Note: the rest of the scene's action plays out around
Gamble's legs.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		You didn't learn that in prison.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		No, and I used to be a lot quicker.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I've got some questions for you but they can wait.



GOODSPEED opens the CORPSE DRAWERS revealing the V.X-. CHEM ROUNDS
(shaped like big tennis ball cans).



GOODSPEED carefully lifts out a chem round.  MASON  
grabs one, accidentally knocking it against the drawer.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Careful.  The second you don't respect this, it kills you.

GOODSPEED and MASON set the V.X. chem rounds on the mortician's table. GOODSPEED 
pulls out his EQUIPMENT KIT.  Begins detaching the tops of the
chem rounds.



GOODSPEED reaches inside a chem round and carefully pulls out..... a
STRAND OF V.X. POISON PEARLS: ping-pong ball sized glass bubbles filled
with poison.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I need a hand here. 
			(MASON looks anxiously at the poison pearls.)
 		Mason.  Now.



<b>GOODSPEED 
</b>hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.  MASON  holds it like a string 
of wind chimes.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		What...  exactly does this do to you?



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge
		at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system.
			(hands over another poison pearl strand) 
		Then loss of muscular function.
		Then you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled
		on the floor, then your skin turns black...



MASON stares uneasily at the pearl strands.

<b>			MASON  
</b>		Sounds like my first marriage.



GOODSPEED  has the chem round's GUIDANCE SYSTEMS exposed.  Inside are
tiny GUIDANCE SYSTEM MICRO-CHIPS. GOODSPEED 
plucks the chip from each chem round and pockets it.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>			(into tac radio) 
		Pier 39 come in.



<b>			SANCHEZ  
</b><b>			(V.O.) 
</b>			(tac radio) 
		Goodspeed?  Where the hell have you been. Talk to me.

</b>		We're in the morgue.  I'm removing the rocket's guidance
		system chips.
			(to Mason) 
		Without em the rocketslll fly about 500
		feet and splash down like a wounded duck.

<b>GOODSPEED 
</b>moves on to the third and fourth chem rounds. Suddenly there's
a BEEP. GOODSPEED and MASON whirl.  Pvt. Gamble's WALKIE TALKIE is
talking to them:


<b>			HUMMEL 
</b><b>			(O.S.) 
</b>		Gamble, Starling.  Come in.

MASON and GOODSPEED exchange a nervous look.

<b>			HUMMEL 
</b><b>			(O.S.) 
</b>		Privates Gamble and Starling, come in.

</b>GOODSPEED goes faster; his hands are
sweating, trembling.  It's like he's lost his spine. 
(And thinking about Carla, perhaps he has.)


<b>			MASON  
</b>		C'mon c'mon....  faster ....


GOODSPEED nearly drops a chem round.  MASON  
recoils.

<b>			MASON  
</b>		I thought you were cool under pressure.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Shut up; you're making me nervous.


<b>EXT.  ALCATRAZ - BETWEEN CELL HOUSE AND MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
Hummel and his men race toward the morgue.

<b>INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>GOODSPEED  has dealt with eight chem
rounds.  There should be seven more, but there's not. GOODSPEED 
counts them ....


<b>			MASON  
</b>		They'll be on us in twenty seconds.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Wait a minute.  Fuck.  Hummel stole fifteen chem rounds. 
		There's only twelve here.  Here.  Quickly.  Do these last four.


MASON raises the poison pearl strands from each of the remaining four
chem rounds. GOODSPEED quickly plucks the chips from the guidance
systems.

THE GRENADE PROJECTILE shoots down the monorail tunnel.

<b>IN CART 1 - MASON  AND GOODSPEED 
</b>duck as the GRENADE PROJECTILE wings
over their heads, continues down the tunnel
and DETONATES against the tunnel wall.



CART 1 roars through smoke and debris left by grenade explosion.  As it
rounds a corner, MASON  
grabs A SPLINTERED TIMBER and releases from the
cart.  CART 1, with GOODSPEED 
alone continues down the mono-rail.



MASON  yanks down a 5 ft. long BROKEN SECTION OF SEWAGE PIPE and presses
himself against the tunnel wall.



AS CART 2 rounds the corner...

WHAM!!  MASON  swings, hitting Scarpetti flush in the forehead, killing
him and blowing him off the cart.  Cart 2, without Scarpetti, continues
down the mono-rail.



MASON  waits.  As CART 3 rounds the corner

MASON  swings again But Hendrix is waiting for it. Hendrix grabs the
swinging pipe and pulls MASON  
into Cart 3!



<b>IN CART 3 - HENDRIX AND MASON

Mason's sprawled on the floor of the cart.  Hendrix levels his M-16. 
MASON whipsaws the legs under Hendrix, bowling him over, the M-16
falling away from the cart.



MASON and Hendrix get to their feet.. They trade blow after blow as the
Cart ROARS through the tunnel.

<b>IN CART 1 ~ GOODSPEED 
</b>looks over his shoulder at MASON  
and Hendrix locked in mortal combat.  He pulls the CART BRAKE.  Cart 1 begins
slowing down.  CART 2 (Scarpettils) rams into it. Now Carts 1 and 2 are
together.  And on comes --

CART 3 - Hendrix knocks MASON  
to the floor of the cart.  Hendrix dives
atop Mason, strangling him. mason's head is bent over the front lip of
the cart.  MASON looks down the mono-rail track.  To his horror he sees
CARTS 1 and 2 slowing down ...

<b>IN CART 1 - 			GOODSPEED 
</b>realizes that his cart is going to ram Mason's
outstretched head.  He releases the brake, and Cart 1 picks up speed ...

IN CART 3 - Hendrix draws the knife.  Hendrix raises the knife.  With
his last strength, MASON rolls away.  Hendrix plunges the knife down,
missing Mason, him momentum carrying his head and shoulders over the
front lip of the cart.  MASON SCREAMS at Goodspeed.

<b>						MASON  
</b><b>		BRAKE! ! !
</b>
<b>IN CART 1 - GOODSPEED 
</b>pulls the cart brake and --

-- CART 3 SLAMS into CARTS 1 and 2 at 20 m.p.h., crushing Hendrixls head
and torso between Carts 2 and 3.


The collision knocks MASON  
off Cart 3, SLAMMING his head against the
tunnel wall.  MASON  falls unconscious.to the tunnel floor, while --


-- CART 1 is shoved by the collision across.a DITCH OF WATER in the
tunnel floor. GOODSPEED 
groggily gets to his feet. Jumps down from the cart.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Mason!

In the midst of this PVT.  ROYCE  
runs up.  Sees MASON concussed,
helpless.  Royce draws his GLINTING KNIFE.  Kneels over Mason.  He's
going to cut his throat.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Wait.

Royce lowers the knife.  Looks across the ditch at Goodspeed.  The ditch
is 20 ft. wide and filled with dank, stagnant water and we've seen dank,
stagnant water before.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Pretty easy killing an unconscious man. How about trying me? 
		Punk. 
			(beat) 
		What're you waiting for?  Limp dick.

<b>			ROYCE  
</b>		I am going to fuck you up something fierce.  You rolled the wrong
		number, shithead.  You crapped out.

And ROYCE begins to wade into the ditch.  And GOODSPEED 
is looking at the water, waiting... ROYCE is waist deep now.  
Royce feels something. He winces.  Looks down at --



FIVE COTTONMOUTH SNAKES, fangs wide and white, plunging into him.  Royce
screams.  His knees buckle.  He falls to his knees in the water.  A
COTTONMOUTH stuck to his neck... Royce SHRIEKS again ...



And slides gently under the water.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I rolled snake-eyes.  Shithead.



Goodspeed, hand over hand on the monorail, eases the cart across the 
stagnant ditch.  Hops out.  MASON gets to his feet.  The two exchange a look.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		Limp dick?

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>It's all I could think of.



They stumble off down the mono-rail tunnel.

		Hell...  hello.

<b>EXT.  ALCATRAZ - PRISON EXERCISE YARD - NIGHT
</b>
LARRY HENDERSON, 48, stands at the end of the exercise yard in a SPOTLIT
AREA.  Capt.  Darrow has his .45 placed against Larry's left temple.



<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		Tell them your name and age.



<b>			LARRY HENDERSON 
</b>		My n...name is L... larry Henderson.  I'm forty-eight.

Larry's quivering voice trails off.  Replaced by:

<b>			HUMMEL 
</b><b>			(V.O.) 
</b>			(loudspeaker)
		Convinced?  Mr. Henderson hopes so. You have
		two minutes.



GOODSPEED turns to Mason.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I'll go.

<b>			MASON  
</b>		Wrong.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		What, vou?

<b>			MASON  
</b>		I'm not the chemical weapons expert.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Good point.  Okay here, take 'em.


GOODSPEED unpockets the V.X. ROCKET'S GUIDANCE CHIPS.  Hands them to
Mason.  MASON heaves them into the bushes.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		What are you doing?

<b>			MASON  
</b>		Now they only have three rockets left.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		What about Mr. Henderson?



<b>			MASON  
</b>		Hummel's a soldier, not a murderer.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Wait.

<b>			MASON  
</b>							(stops; turns) 
		Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men
		guarding them.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I... I don't know if I can do this.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		There's only one way to find out.  I'll try to give you time.  And
		Goodspeed.... 
				(tosses GOODSPEED his ATROPINE SYRINGE) 
		Don't be an idiot. Put that on.



MASON moves off into the night.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Well thank-you, thank-you very much.



GOODSPEED creeps toward the China Alley rocket launcher.

<b>EXT.  CHINA ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
GOODSPEED moves under the grated, multi-level
structure of china Alley.  Looks up through the grate.  The ROCKET
LAUNCHER sits on the grate on the level above him.

</b>
MASON  walks down the middle of the cell block toward the opening to the
exercise yard.



<b>EXT.  ALCATRAZ - PRISON YARD - ONE MINUTE LATER - NIGHT
</b>
Darrow with his gun to Larry Henderson's head.  Hummel paces in the
background.  MASON emerges ftom the cell block.


MASON  walks up to Hummel.  The two stand there a moment, regarding each
other.


<b>			CAPTAIN DARROW
</b>		Gotta be kidding me.  They send an old man.


MASON gives Darrow a hard-eyed glance.  Hummel takes a lap around Mason,
sizing him up.


<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		I thought I'd been in the service a long time.  Name and rank,
		sailor.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		John Paul Mason. 
							(stares at Hummel) 
		Royal Navy.  Commander.


<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		You're a long way from England, Commander Mason.


<b>			MASON  
</b>		I feel strangely at home.



<b>			HUMMEL 
</b> 		How's that?

<b>			MASON  
</b>		You wouldn't believe me if I told you.


<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility,
		Commander Mason?



<b>			MASON  
</b>		Quite unique.



<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		How's that?



<b>			MASON  
</b>		I was a guest here.

Glances all around.  Someone laughs.  Everyone laughs.

<b>EXT.  CHINA ALLEY ROCKET LAUNCH STATION - NIGHT 
</b>
Pvt.  COX mans the
launcher.  Suddenly a voice:

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b><b>			(V.O.) 
</b>		Freeze. 
			(Cox freezes) 
		Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly.



Pvt.  Cox drops his weapon.  Slowly turns.  Goodspeed, one hand on his
gun, the other on HIS TOOLS, begins to unscrew the V.X. CHEM ROUND
<b>FACE-PLATE.
</b>
<b>ON THE GRATED LEVEL ABOVE GOODSPEED 
</b>- PVT.  MCCOY appears. Looking down,
he sees GOODSPEED and Cox.  He cinches his REPELLING CLIP to the steel
railing.



<b>EXT.  ALCATRAZ - PRISON YARD - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		Well you're some kind of joker, Mason.  Maybe you're a lunatic.

</b>		I'm not threatening the lives of a million innocent people.  You
		are.



Hummells demeanor changes.  Hard now.  Tight.


<b>			HUMMEL 
</b> 		Give me the guidance chips.


<b>			MASON  
</b>		I threw them in the bay.



<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		That was stupid of you.

		Would you have shot him7

<b>CUT TO:

The marines look at Hummel, wondering the same thing. 220  EXT.  CHINA
ALLEY ROCKET LAUNCHING STATION - NIGHT GOODSPEED, still holding Cox at
bay, pulls the V.X. chem round from the rocket.  The going is slow. he
begins to lift the POISON PEARL STRANDS from the chem round.  His hand
reaches to unclip the GUIDANCE SYSTEM CHIP.


Suddenly PVT.  MCCOY repels to the level behind Goodspeed. Goodspeed
grabs the chip and dashes off, slamming through an OLD WOODEN DOOR into
the CIVIL WAR RUINS.



<b>EXT.  PRISON YARD - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</b>
MASON and Hummel.  The previous question dangles in the air: Would you
have shot him?
<b>		
</b>
<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		You seem like a bright man, Commander. Bright men understand
		necessity.


<b>			MASON  
</b>		Bright men also obey the law. "Wherever law ends, terror begins."
		John Locke.


<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		"Where there is no law, there is no transgression." The Bible. 
		Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.

</b>		Article 7, American Constitution?  "Treason against the United

		I see little difference in my motivation.

Goodspeed, inside the Civil War ruins, levels his gun at the door.  The

Suddenly GUNSHOTS.  Coming from China Alley.  Hummel and men whirl
around, startled.



<b>			HUMMEL 
</b>		Frye, Crisp, go!


<b>EXT.  CHINA ALLY ROCKET LAUNCHING STATION - NIGHT
</b>GOODSPEED wildly
discharges his gun until CLICK, the clip is spent.  Cox and McCoy step
through the doorway.


GOODSPEED shoves the guidance chip in his mouth.


<b>			MCCOY 
</b>		Swallow that and I swear on my Aunt Myrtle's grave I'll cut your
		belly open and pull it out.

McCoy and Cox spring at Goodspeed.  McCoy whips the butt end of his gun
against Goodspeed's head. GOODSPEED crumples, unconscious.  McCoy jams
his fingers in Goodspeed's mouth.

MCCOY He bit the fuckin' thing.  It's shot.


<b>INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - CELL BLOCK 'ID" - MORNING

GOODSPEED squints through painful eyes, gaining consciousness. he looks
around, taking stock of the start cell on 'ID" block.  Gets to his feet.
 Goes to the bars:

</b>		Mason. 
						(no response) 
		Mason?

<b>			MASON  
</b><b>			(V.O.) 
</b>		It's about time.

</b>		Above you. 
						(under his breath)
		 Literally and figuratively.


WIDENING, we see that MASON'S MATTRESS has been ripped into long strips.
<b> MASON  
</b>is BRAIDING THE STRIPS into a long rope.  The rope is quite
finely constructed.  Mason's been at this several hours.


INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO CELLS (and during the following, MASON  
keeps busy with his rope braiding).


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		This is tiny.


<b>			MASON  
</b>		You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of
		your anatomy ....

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		The cell, Mason.


<b>			MASON  
</b>		Five feet by seven.  Try living in one for a year.  What happened?


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I only got one chem round.  There are two left.  I fucked up.


<b>			MASON  
</b>			(sarcastic) 
		Surprise, surprise.

<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.

<b>			MASON  
</b>		An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.


<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon.  Tell me.


<b>			MASON  
</b>		Let's say our countries had a little dispute.  They both knowingly
		shafted me.

under the wings of an F-16.



ACROSS THE HMGAR - General Peterson and Captain Giler brief FOUR F-16
<b>TOP GUN PILOTS.
</b>


GENERAL PETERSON The target.  Alcatraz Island.  This is not a precision
strike.  The entire island is to be blanketed.



LWO F-16 PILOT Sir, we hit that Island with Willy Peter and it's going
to look like Iwo Jima.  No one can survive it.



GENERAL PETERSON (grimly) That's why this is a volunteer mission,
Captain.  If any of you have doubts you can carry it out, speak up.


The pilots look at each other.  Silence.

<b>			GENERAL PETERSON 
</b>		Captain Giler?

<b>			CPT.  GILER 
</b>		We jerry-rigged a release lever.  You'll find it on the left

GOODSPEED stares blankly into space.  INTERCUT between the two cells
again.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Jesus. 
			(thinks) 
		Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau
		where the microfilm was?  Make a trade?



<b>			MASON  
</b>		Some trade.  They'd get the microfilm and I'd get a bullet in the
		head.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		I see your point.  Something's been on my mind.  About your
		escape.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		What?

MASON  rises.  Lifts the bed.  Pulls off the bed's heavy ROLLING CASTER. 
Knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		You went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the
		power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe -
		that much I've got ' But... howld you get out of your cell?


MASON leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell
block.  The braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>			(cont'd) 
		I only ask because, in our current situation, it
		might be useful information ...



The result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the
rolling caster tied to it.  MASON  holds the other end of the rope 
through the bars of his cell.

<b>			MASON  
</b>		Trade secret, Billy, I'll tell you this:	it was easier than
		getting in.

<b>MASON  
</b>fiercely yanks the rope toward him.  The heavy rolling caster
jerks from the floor.  The CASTER, pulling the rope, flies past Mason's
cell --


-- shooting in an arc around the corner of the cell block, still pulling
the rope, where --



-- the caster-pulled ROPE catches the CELL RELEASE LEVER against the
wall.  The rope coils, WRAP WRAP WHAP, around the release lever handle.



<b>MASON  
</b>tugs the rope taut like he's just snagged a fish. Then he pulls
slowly and delicately.



THE CELL DOOR RELEASE LEVER pulls down and --

-~ MASON'S CELL DOOR (and all the doors on that tier) open at once.  And

Suddenly Goodspeed's cell door opens. GOODSPEED exits the cell.  MASON
stands there.



<b>			MASON  
</b>		You're on your own, kid.  Your gear's over there.



MASON  motions to a HEAP OF THEIR GEAR (clothes, weapons, flares) in the
corner of the cell tier.



<b>			GOODSPEED 
</b>		Shit....

<b>GOODSPEED 
</b>grabs his guns and gear and follows after
Mason. 225  EXT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel

Suddenly the HEAVY STEEL DOOR creaks open and --


-- A SATCHEL EXPLOSIVE flings out, sliding across the corridor floor
toward Mason.  MASON

s printing the other way.

crumbled cinder block.

Darrow drops his gun.  Pulls out a TITANIUM BLADED KNIFG.

<b>			CAPTAIN DARROW
</b>		You know how this shit works?


Darrow advances on Goodspeed.  The only route to GOODSPEED 
is between the rocket and the window.  Darrow continues advancing., GOODSPEED 
eyes the launcher's IGNITION SWITCH.  As Darrow passes between thewindow and
the launcher ....

POISON PEARL STRANDS, his hand shaking.  With the other hand, he unclips
the ROCKET GUIDANCE CHIP.



The COPPER STRANDS holding the pearls are corroded.  A strand BREAKS. 
Four PEARLS fall. GOODSPEED 
catches three.  The FOURTH drops, hitting
his SHOE.  It rolls along the rooftop. GOODSPEED 
sets aside the other
pearls and dives, grabbing the stray pearl an inch from the roof,s edge.



Suddenly THE HUGE LIGHTHOUSE WINDOW behind GOODSPEED 
EXPLODES, showering GOODSPEED with glass.



ON THE ADJACENT ROOFTOP ~ PVT.  MCCOY, wielding a smoking .60 Cal
MACHINE GUN.  McCoy fires a wicked, long, sustained burst, emptyinc his
entire ammunition belt.


THE LIGHTHOUSE SEARCHLIGHT FRESNEL blows to shreds.
GOODSPEED rolls away, GLASS SHARDS raining down on him, cutting him-.  
He's a sitting duck.



MCCOY casts aside the .60 Cal and unshoulders a SNIPER RIFLE.  Draws a
bead on GOODSPEED 
again.  GOODSPEED, bleeding, terrified, cowers,
awaiting death.


A SILHOUETTE APPEARES behind McCoy.  It's MASON, dirty and bloodied. 
McCoy spins.  MASON  
bats the rifle aside, KNEES McCoy in the solar
plexus, grips McCoyls NECK -- SNAP! -and HURLS him off the roof.  McCoy
falls 5 floors.

punches.  On comes Cox.  He's huge and menacing.  He hits MASON  
again. Again.  Again.  Cox has MASON  backed up to the stairwell. -

<b>INT.  NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING - DAY
</b>
Goodspeed, frantic, sprints across the floor, SPLASHING through puddles.
He loses his footing. falls and slides across the floor, clutching the
guidance chip an,d pear.

He gets to his feet.  LIMPS behind some RUSTY MACHINERY.

FRYE enters.  Sees RIPPLES IN PUDDLES left by Goodspeed. Frye creeps
across the floor.  Following the ripples.

<b>INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY
</b>
Mason's nearly through.  Backed up against the railing.  Cox comes in
again.  WHAM WHAM.  MASON spits blood and teeth. MASON'S moves to
his pocket.  As Cox comes in for the death blow --



MASON  pulls the MOTOR OIL from his picket and sprays it in Cox's eyes. 
The big man is dazed, blinded.  MASON  
steps aside and rams Cox over the
railing.  Cox falls to his death on the floor below.  MASON  
looks down
at him.


<b>MASON  
</b>Snakes hate the stuff.


<b>INT.  NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING - DAY
</b>
Frye creeps close to Goodspeed's hiding place. GOODSPEED 
lunges from
behind the machinery, jamming his fingers into Fryels mouth and ramming
home the POISON PEARL.


GOODSPEED HAMMERS his fist into Fryels JAW.  We hear the glass breaking
in Fryels mouth.  Fryels eyes widen.  GREY SMOKE SPEWS FROM HIS MOUTH
AND NOSTRILS.  His eyes bulge.


GOODSPEED tries to step away.  Frye bearhugs him, pressing his face
close.  Frye open his mouth, spewing forth a CLOUD OF POISON in
Goodspeed's face.


<b>			CAPTAIN FRYE 
</b>		You're comin, with me.


GOODSPEED shoves Frye away.  Frye drops, his body quivering.  Blood
pours form his ears and nose.  Frye spasms in a sickening dance of
death.


GOODSPEED reels away,.  COUGHING.  Dizzy, he falls to his knees.  He's
gassed and knows it.  Desperately, he rips at his PANDLEG.  A SYRINGE
taped to his calf.  ATROPINE.


He pulls it free and hesitates.  A beat, then -- He PLUNGES the long
needle into his chest.  Into his heart.  Depresses the plunger.

		Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.

understanding.
