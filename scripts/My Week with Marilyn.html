           Over a DARK SCREEN we see the caption:
           "This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space,
           which nevertheless was real" - Colin Clark.
           Then, FADE UP ON:
           Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH
           arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited
           crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop
           to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER:

           Gone With The Wind star Vivien
           Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a

</b>
           It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark
           family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting
           sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,
           complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling
           of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something
           profoundly English.
           We are a very long way from Hollywood.

           COLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he
           is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a
           beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak
           doors.

</b>
           As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front
           of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter,
           Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a
           woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the
           painting.

<b>                          KENNETH
</b>           ... and this is one of Carracci's
           earlier works and one is able to
           see the emergence of his now famous
           Baroque style, which is clearly
           rooted in the tradition of high
           renaissance and antiquity...
           COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the
           scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The
           whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams
           affectionately.

<b>                          KENNETH
</b>           Colin! Come in. Have you met James
           and Anna? Two very brilliant
           pupils.
           He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a
           little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no
           time to waste.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm leaving for London now, Pa.

<b>                          KENNETH
</b>           Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear
           boy...
           He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to
           walk him back to the door.

<b>                          KENNETH
</b>           I can always get you a research
           position at the V&A when you've
           grown up a bit and got this film
           idea out of your system...
           COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into
           the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Kenneth, you might have told Cook
           we were another two for dinner.
           What is everyone supposed to eat?
           Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling,
           there you are...

           She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress,
           eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a
           dozen things at once.

<b>                          COLIN

</b>           My job interview, remember..?
           But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles
           hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as
           COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.

           JANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch up.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Can't you stay for dinner? There's
           nothing to eat but I'm sure the
           conversation will be charming.

</b>           I don't want to be late in the
           morning.
           As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an
           elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning
           evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be
           a famous film director in no time.
           I know your father's put in a word.

</b>           I wish he hadn't done that. I can
           manage on my own.
           She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks
           around the garden with a frown.

<b>                          JANE

           prunings and we'll lose the tea
           roses for ever.
           And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't
           help smiling at the madness of it all.

           The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle.
           COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in
           the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but
           racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her
           attention fully to him for the first time.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Now go and have a lovely time,
           darling. We're always here when
           you're ready to talk your future.
           COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out
           JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house
           with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook
           and ask her how many pork chops we
           need for tonight. Then bring the
           car round. I must get to the
           village before the shop shuts...
           She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an
           afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes.
           COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house.
           We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly
           his need to get away.
           He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of
           the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun,
           the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for
           the road ahead.

           A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside.
           It is early morning in the heart of London's West End. The
           streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and
           raincoats stream from the tube stations.
           COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in
           Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home
           here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes
           by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in
           measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave.
           COLIN waves back.

           outside the imposing facade of 144 Piccadilly. A plaque
           outside the door announces: LAURENCE OLIVIER PRODUCTIONS.
           Colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure
           everything is correctly in place, then goes to the door and
           rings the bell.

           The reception area is luxurious - deep pile carpets and

           A new morning. COLIN perches restlessly on the sofa.
           Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started. The
           seconds pass in dull silence. He is beginning to think his
           campaign will fail. But then, in a heartbeat, everything
           changes.
           He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR
           LAURENCE OLIVIER strides in with his wife VIVIEN LEIGH on
           his arm.

<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 10.

          At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his
          fame. He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is
          scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star
          remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating.
          Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they
          are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them
          with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone
          who comes into contact with them.
          VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet
          them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable
          bluster and bonhomie.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Do you know, Hughie, it is simply
           impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on

           spends the entire day asleep. But
           great beauty has its way...
          He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic
          response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices
          COLIN hovering by the sofa.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           Hello, boy... remind me?
          He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.

<b>                          VIVIEN
</b>           You remember Colin, darling. You
           met him at the Clarks' party.

<b>                          OLIVIER

           your film.
          OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his
          pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of
          cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Have a cigarette. Keep the pack.

           in?
          He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they
          disappear together into Perceval's office.
          VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks
          dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees
          they are called "Oliviers". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in
          amusement.

</b>           I suppose he's all right.
          VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a
          handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly,
          getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of
          Marilyn's charms as she strokes COLIN's cheek.

           Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation.

           OLIVIER looks hunted. There is no way out. He glances back
           at PERCEVAL as he comes in.

           and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold-
           up screen in the corner of the room.
           Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the
           film's lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF. They take no notice
           of Colin.
           He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up,
           hair and wardrobe tests for the film. MARILYN MONROE in

           The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting
           silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in
           costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she
           wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking
           wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon.
           It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches,
           fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still
           holding the tray -

           COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to

           He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot

           There is a flash of sudden anger in her expression.

</b>           Oh, don't be such a boy!
           COLIN looks shaken and she touches his hand in contrition.

</b>           I'm 43, darling. No one will love

           He goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his
           lips, her smile quickly restored.

           The Dog and Duck is a rundown pub in an out of the way lane
           near the studios. It is a rough, local place utterly devoid
           of glamour or comfort. COLIN stands outside, staring at it
           grimly, his bag in his hand.

           A few hard-core LOCALS stand nursing their pints at the bar.
           One is idly throwing darts. The wallpaper is faded yellow
           with cigarette smoke, stale sandwiches curl in a display
           case. COLIN looks around, his heart sinking. BARRY, the
           landlord looks him up and down, disparagingly.

<b>                          COLIN

           BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it
           around for COLIN to sign.

<b>                          BARRY

          COLIN can't help looking a little pleased with himself.

<b>                          COLIN

          The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed.

<b>                          BARRY
</b>           What film's that?

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           It's called `The Sleeping Prince'.
          The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains
          steady.

<b>                          ANDY

          ANDY doesn't look away from his game.

</b>           Can't be bothered.
          COLIN tries to impress.

<b>                          BARRY
</b>           Oh, will you now?
          The regulars grin unkindly into their pints. ANDY doesn't
          look away from his game, as he offers laconically:

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           The Queen and Prince Philip popped
           in for a pint earlier. Pity, you
           just missed them.
          There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS.
          COLIN takes it on the chin. BARRY hands him a key.

<b>                          BARRY

           week in advance. You're in number
           two.
          COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with
          perfect deadpan timing:

<b>                          BARRY (CONT'D)

           COLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room
           above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the
           furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp.
           Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag
           on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He
           looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot
           under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion.

           The principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still
           known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the
           half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in
           their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first
           amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied.
           DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very
           much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully.
           RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin.

           COLIN hurries along the corridor and stops outside

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Miss Monroe?
           The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman
           in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG.

           mirror, her reflection framed in the lights. She wears
           little or no make-up. PAULA looks at him sharply.

           MARILYN glances up at COLIN in the mirror and smiles with
           unexpected simplicity.

           sneaks a glance at her. She has a vulnerable, lost
           expression. COLIN can't help staring at her until he
           notices PAULA looking at him and quickly glances away.

           dark glasses on throughout. OLIVIER rises to greet her.

           PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an
           empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables. She
           looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to
           the empty one.

           She smiles kindly at MARILYN who smiles back tentatively from
           behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as
           he makes his opening speech of welcome.

<b>                          OLIVIER

           little fraternity. (Pause, looks
           around) We may seem a little
           strange and quaint to you at
           first, but I hope that in time
           you may come to find your method
           in our madness.
           Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he
           gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely
           sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN
           also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned
           but clumsy joke.
           Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a
           sentimental flourish.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)

           He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes
           discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK.
           There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of
           eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the
           reading.

           wearing only his thin summer jacket. He blows on his hands

           The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on
           one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging
           shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly
           beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her
           head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work
           on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware
           of the scrutiny of the crew.
           She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the
           weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her
           face.
           She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her

           OLIVIER is in front of the camera with MARILYN, who
           flutters her hands nervously in an odd calming gesture.
           PAULA mutters a last few words in her ear, reading her
           lines to her from her small brown notebook.
           COLIN watches intently. A bell rings and the red light goes

           She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the

           Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few

          herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR.
          ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas.

           OLIVIER scowls at COLIN, who gives him a cigarette. MARILYN
           finally emerges with PAULA at her elbow. OLIVIER advances
           on her, his anger simmering.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Marilyn, darling you are an
           angel, and I kiss the hem of your
           garment, but why can't you get
           here on time for the love of
           fuck?

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Oh... you have that word in
           England too?
           She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite
           there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence.

<b>                          PAULA

           She has to find in herself all

           Acting isn't just a case of
           putting on a costume or some
           ludicrous false nose.
           OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's
           hand, leading her forward like a child.

           reddens with humiliation.

           This poor girl hasn't had your
           years of experience. She is in a
           strange country, acting a strange
           part. Now, are you helping or
           bullying?
           OLIVIER looks aghast at being so roundly rebuked. COLIN
           looks on, startled.

</b>
           OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS
           watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They
           watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the " The Coconut
           Girl" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is
           dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is
           an effective but theatrical performance.
           MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back
           row watching her performance from the same scene. She
           fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses,
           looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand
           tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming
           and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's
           look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and
           reassurance.

<b>                          MILLER
</b>           That one's pretty damn good. You
           knocked it out of the park.
           MARILYN glows at his praise.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           When Marilyn gets it right you
           just don't want to look at anyone
           else.
           OLIVIER frowns. For all his greatness as an actor he will
           never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive
           Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his
           heart.
           At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches
           MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn
           entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on
           screen he begins to see things differently.

           He sneaks a look at her in real life. She is holding
           MILLER's hand tightly, looking tense and vulnerable as one
           disastrous take follows another.

</b>           COLIN bursts into the dressing room without knocking.
           Clothes are strewn carelessly all over the floor. There are
           pill bottles, full and empty, on every surface, along with
           empty bottles of champagne and bunches of flowers. COLIN
           rummages around on the table, moving piles of scripts and
           books. No luck. He walks casually through the half-open
           door into the inner chamber.
           And stops dead in his tracks.
           MARILYN stands by a chair, a towel wrapped around her head.
           She is completely naked.
           She looks at him in astonishment.
           He stares back, equally astounded.
           He sees her script, heavily covered in handwritten notes,
           lying on the table next to an open bottle of champagne and
           a bottle of pills.

          MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is
          surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A
          feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come
          running to look, pushing and shoving to see.
          MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin
          with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the
          cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press
          towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it
          becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream
          Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face.
          A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back
          against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on
          her face.

          COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what
          they can to keep the excited fans at bay.
          They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open
          and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is
          pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around
          her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the
          front, with Milton running alongside the moving car to dive
          in beside Marilyn.
          People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in

           great performance. You should
           give her as long as it takes.
           Chaplin took eight months to make
           a movie.

           kill myself.
          Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN
          watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective
          gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming
          gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar
          put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to
          allow her to sit down). PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN
          looks up at her in anguish.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I can't do this. I can't.
          PAULA looks at her adamantly.

<b>                          PAULA

           You will have more pain, you will
           suffer more but you will create.
           All you need is time.
          MARILYN looks at her, desperately wanting to believe it.

           MARILYN's smile is a grimace of terror. COLIN can hardly

           There is a stunned moment. WATTIS gapes and MARILYN looks
           around uncertainly. Did she say it? OLIVIER gestures
           frantically from behind the camera that she should carry
           on. She hesitates...
           ... there is an agonising beat...
           ... and then she panics and bolts for the side of the set.

           He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the
           set, lowering his voice, trying to conceal his exasperation
           with a honeyed tone.

          OLIVIER is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her

           mirror with MILTON GREENE. COLIN unobtrusively fetches
           whisky and cigarettes for them both as OLIVIER abruptly

           MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks
           up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of
           pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it

           MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall
           only a few feet away from Colin. She is wrapped in a pink
           bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank
           and sedated. By her side is an open spiral bound notebook,
           its pages closely crammed with handwriting.

           She stares at COLIN. It is not even clear she knows he is
           there. COLIN gazes back at her, paralysed. MILLER's voice
           comes again, flat and tired.

           and let's get some sleep.
           Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it
           to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders
           she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door.
           As the light snaps off COLIN breathes for the first time in
           what feels like minutes.

           wearing a bathrobe, her face in shadow. Pill bottles are
           scattered across the dresser at her elbow. There is a long

</b>           Are you all right, Miss Monroe?
           He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But
           then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge.

</b>           Colin? Whose side are you on?
           COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and
           vulnerable in the shadowy light. There is only one answer
           anyone could give.

           He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks
           so lost and vulnerable. Perhaps he means it. Perhaps he is
           on her side now.

           MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance
           routine. Released from the need to remember any words she
           takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in
           her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky,
           mildly silly and charming all at the same time.
           The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina
           isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates
           joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and
           MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the
           actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the
           doorway.
           Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one
           can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely
           joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn
           is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his
           face as he watches.

           The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit
           in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours
           whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both
           men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about.
           MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it.

<b>                          MILLER
</b>           I dreamed last night I could hear
           singing. And then I realised it
           wasn't a dream. There was a male

           under our window. At two in the
           morning. It's a circus. A freak

           Sleep. It's what she lives for.
           Sleep is her demon.

          OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head.

<b>                          MILLER (CONT'D)
</b>           She thought I could smash all her
           insecurities with one magical
           stroke. That I could make her a

          He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully.

</b>           She wants me to protect her but I
           can't. I can't even protect
           myself. (Pause) She read some
           notes I made. They were nothing.
           Just a few ideas.

<b>                          OLIVIER

          He looks up and nods slowly.

<b>                          MILLER
</b>           She took them the wrong way.
          He leaves a long, uneasy pause.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           But you do love her? Your new

           Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks
           at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and
           relaxed, relishing every second of their attention.

           CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock
           misery.

           of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is
           totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN
           comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out.
           VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and
           she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade
           of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at
           him with bitter disappointment.

</b>           Oh, Colin. Not you too.
           He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away.

</b>           COLIN pushes open the door to the projection booth. The
           screen is lit up with the rushes of the scene in The Prince
           And The Showgirl where a startlingly beautiful MARILYN, in
           gorgeous close-up, eats caviar and drinks champagne in a
           toast to the American President.

          OLIVIER and VIVIEN stand in the shadows of the projector
          beam. COLIN freezes in the doorway to the projection booth
          holding a pile of film cans. VIVIEN is crying abjectly.

<b>                          VIVIEN
</b>           I didn't think she would be so

</b>           Only because she didn't want you.

<b>                          OLIVIER

           didn't think the little tart
           could resist the great Laurence

          She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred
          seething in her expression.
           VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           But she saw through you, didn't she

           without a script.

           COLIN hurries to offer him one of his "Oliviers". OLIVIER
           grimaces wryly.

</b>           Not one of those awful things.
           COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to
           OLIVIER, who lights it with a shaking hand. He inhales
           deeply.

           The set is dressed and the crew are waiting but once again

           PAUL HARDWICK amongst them, sit apathetically in full

           hell didn't she call me?
           His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast
           to OLIVIER, who looks at COLIN with a new interest,
           wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that
           can work to his advantage. He smiles calmly.

           He looks at COLIN dubiously as he goes out. COLIN is
           nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself. He
           looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and
           is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the
           brandy and picks it up -

           COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway,
           casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a
           pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy.

           She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away
           from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his
           gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks
           up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the
           decanter from his hand.

          She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself
          sinking into her gaze.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm only the third. Just a

          He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She
          stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self-
          conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens
          and coughs. She laughs.

          She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The

           turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own
           laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes
           shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be.
           He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in
           irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself

           barely under control.

           COLIN can't help joining her.

           COLIN looks at MARILYN but she shakes her head between
           giggles. He turns back to the phone, barely able to get the
           words out between snorts of laughter.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go.
           He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN
           smiles.

           we can find any more reporters in

           She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes
           his arm.

           There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks.
           MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the
           path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical
           closeness.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I didn't know it was so pretty
           out here.

</b>
                         
           MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a
           friendly way as they walk.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           I wanted to be an artist. To
           grow as an actor. I was so proud
           to be working with the great
           Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks
           I'm the enemy.
           She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           He doesn't understand your kind
           of actor. He's hated the method
           ever since Vivien worked with
           Elia Kazan. It's all too new and
           strange. You're the future, and
           it frightens him.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Every time I walk into the studio
           I feel this sense of doom come
           over me. He looks at me like
           he's smelling a pile of rotten
           fish. And the crew hate me.
           Paula is the only person I can
           trust. (Pause) Except for you
           now, maybe.
           She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses
           swim as he stares into them...
           ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.

</b>           Phone call for you, Miss Monroe.
           It's Mr. Miller.
           MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing
           back briefly at Colin.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for
           telling me the truth.
           COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises
           that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.

<b>                          ROGER

</b>           I didn't spend the night with
           her. We just had a chat.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           I heard them chuckling.
          OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.

</b>           Perhaps if Colin is very
           diplomatic Marilyn is more likely
           to behave herself.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           She just wants a chum, that's
           all.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           A chum? Jesus Christ, what is
           this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up,
           kid.
          He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
          OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror
          and sighs abruptly.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           I thought working with Marilyn
           would make me feel young again.
           But I look dead in the rushes.
           Dead behind the eyes.
          He gazes at himself thoughtfully.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           Perhaps I'm angry with her
           because in my heart I know my own
           career is in a terrible rut. I
           wanted to renew myself through
           her but all I see reflected in
           that magnificent face is my own
           inadequacy.
          He leans back.

</b>           You know, I admire Marilyn. I

           She has taken everything
           Hollywood can throw at her and
           triumphed.
          COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him.

           Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at
           the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is
           greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS,
           PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.

<b>                          SOUNDMAN

           It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely

           There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner
           only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him.

           A brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as
           MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume
           attended to by LUCY.

           It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date
           with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently
           behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an
           angry MILTON.

           jealous...
           ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind
           the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.

           the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like
           the idea being dismissed so lightly.
           Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.
           Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them
           in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and

           are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.

           COLIN crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and
           collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats
           up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands
           then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to
           block it out.

           The studio is quiet at the weekend. COLIN walks along,
           snatching a moment for a cigarette. As he reaches the doors
           to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside
           him. ROGER SMITH is at the wheel.

           COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and
           MILTON emerges. He glances darkly at COLIN and ROGER.

<b>                          MILTON

          COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his
          cigarette and hurries to the passenger door.

<b>                          MILTON

           forward to it, haven't we, Colin?
          COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON
          frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           Okay, well, have a nice time boys.
          Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER.

          He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back
          gleefully.

           Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running
           back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.

           He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries
           herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over
           into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and
           the car roars off.

           COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN
           emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing.

           COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back

           make room for him.

           She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands
           meshed together.
           ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his
           eyes.
           In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches

           ROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to

           and gentleman for the day. They'd

</b>           Christ, is that..?

           COLIN and MARILYN emerge. A small crowd of POLICEMEN,
           SERVANTS and CASTLE WORKERS has gathered. There are cheers
           as they see her. COLIN looks nervously at MARILYN but she
           smiles and winks at him, mocking herself gently.

           She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out,
           shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn
           "look". The delighted crowd bursts into cheers. COLIN
           stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a
           star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be
           leaving with him. One of the spectators turns to him.

           MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into

           clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed
           behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and
           MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water.

<b>                          MARILYN

           He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under
           the water. She holds her head up to him.

<b>                          COLIN

           She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and
           suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before
           he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.

           She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self-
           conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats.
           Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the
           shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances
           away, embarrassed.

          COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his
          erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.

          He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering
          as she tries to dry herself. COLIN goes to take her in his
          arms.

          She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He
          rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only
          barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes
          more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than
          rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her

          She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo
          of a lost childhood.
          He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.
          As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans
          forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as
          sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.
          The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching
          gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine
          behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him
          with a radiant smile.

           cough and ROGER appears.

</b>           But she was wonderful yesterday.
          MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his
          hostility in barbed politeness.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           I don't know what you did to her,
           kid, but she got nervous. I had
           to give her some pills to calm
           her down.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           She doesn't need pills! She just
           needs someone to care for her.

<b>                          MILTON
</b>           Someone like you?
          COLIN reddens. MILTON shakes his head patronisingly.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           I told you, I'm not in love with

</b>           Spare me the bullshit. I know
           everything.
          COLIN stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth.

<b>                          MILTON (CONT'D)
</b>           You messed her up, kid. Confused
           her.
          He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded.

<b>                          MILTON (CONT'D)
</b>           I've got every penny I ever made
           tied up in Marilyn. She owes me.
           If it wasn't for me she'd still
           be on contracts that make slave
           wages look good. I gave her back
           her freedom, and now Miller's
           turning her against me. That's
           what you get for trying to help
           Marilyn Monroe.
          He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking
          more in sorrow than anger.

           A shaft of moonlight reveals MARILYN lying naked across the
           bed, her body partly covered by the sheet. Half empty pill
           and champagne bottles are scattered all over her dresser;
           there is also an old photograph in a silver frame of her
           mother Gladys.

           finds it. He goes to unlock the door, but then pauses,
           looking back at Marilyn. He puts the key back and bends
           down to whisper at the keyhole.

           never seen in him before. He pulls up the sheet so that it
           covers her nakedness, then tentatively lies down to rest
           his head on the pillow.

          stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched
          with both sensuality and a longing for something less
          tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The
          embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily.
          He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily.
          He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.

          does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away
          from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily.

          She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies
          cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she
          buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against
          his back. She curls against him.

           through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath,
           her back towards him. She is practicing the gentle waltz

           COLIN paces nervously up and down the hall. PAULA appears.
           She looks at him for a long, unnerving moment then speaks
           with sudden ferocity.

</b>           From the first moment all I have
           felt is Olivier's loathing and
           contempt. He thinks I'm

           me, no Marilyn.
           He is taken aback by her passion. She smiles bitterly then
           walks on. COLIN hesitates. She looks back briefly.

           COLIN comes in with PAULA. MARILYN looks at him dully, her
           eyes clouded and unfocused. A half empty pill bottle stands
           on the side. COLIN sits down next to her and she takes his
           hand, ignoring the surprised look on Milton's face.

           A flicker of terror crosses MARILYN's face. COLIN turns on

          MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the
          field. Paula is more reluctant to give in. She sits on the
          bed, stroking Marilyn's hand.

<b>                          PAULA

          Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN
          watches her in silence. MARILYN squeezes her hand and PAULA
          gets up with a heavy sigh, bitterly reluctant to leave.
          Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone.
          As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed.

           awake. She gazes at him, hazy but lucid.

          Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity

          She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her
          eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain
          that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't
          want to be rescued.

           replaced by a bleak, frightened expression.

           The crew are ready. The actors are on set. OLIVIER stands by
           the camera. COLIN is half-hidden in the shadows. There is a
           flurry of activity and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one
           side and MILTON on the other. She looks exactly as Marilyn
           should. With her white dress shimmering in the lights and her
           platinum blonde hair glowing, she has the air of a Goddess.
           She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores him.
           He can't help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret.

</b>          MARILYN turns to the assembled crew. A silence settles. She
          smiles around, blinking in the lights. She looks for comfort
          or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or
          sullen hostility. She smiles nervously.

          This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence.
          No one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty.
          Perhaps they think it is just another performance.

           OLIVIER, in character, lies back on a sofa, with MARILYN on
           top of him, singing the waltz that Colin first heard after
           his night with her. MARILYN looks kittenish and irresistible
           as she sings only a few inches from OLIVIER's face.

<b>           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
</b>           "..I found a dream and lay in your

           free, that's the way to start,
           there will be nothing to lose till

           She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There
           is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch. COLIN is
           amongst them. It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy
           for him. He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has crept
           up silently behind him to watch the scene. As he turns to her
           she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring
           softly so that only he can hear.

<b>                          SYBIL THORNDIKE
</b>           First love is such sweet despair,

           She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a
           long ago memory of her own, before retreating quietly into
           the darkness at the back of the set.

           CLOSE on MARILYN as she smiles, her face radiating joy and
           vitality.
           And then, in the split second before ORTON calls `cut',
           MARILYN turns her head just a fraction and winks at Colin. He
           grins. OLIVIER looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles

           The crew shake hands and clap each other on the back like a
           group of hardened war veterans. ORTON offers COLIN a
           grudging nod - `well done'. MILTON now comes forward,
           calling out above the hubbub.

           MILTON indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio,
           loaded with gaily wrapped parcels. He ushers the crew over.

          At first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd
          happens. One of the crew simply picks up his present without
          looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against
          the wall.
          There is a moment, then a WOMAN does the same with hers.
          Suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps
          their present. The bin is soon overflowing.
          MILTON stares at the scene, then simply shrugs and walks out.
          ARTHUR JACOBS, utterly indifferent to the hostile
          undercurrent, grins and waves cheerfully.

          He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the
          dustbin as he goes.

          COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in
          silence as another sequence is projected for them. The
          sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and
          caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before
          collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone,
          what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous
          beauty.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           (After a second)
           She's quite wonderful. No
           training, no craft, no guile,
           just pure instinct. Astonishing.
          He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in
          surprise.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           You should tell her that.

<b>                          OLIVIER
</b>           Oh, I will. But she won't believe
           me. That's probably what makes
           her great. It's certainly what
           makes her so profoundly unhappy.
          He smiles wryly.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           I tried my best to change her,
           but she remains brilliant despite
           me. (Pause) Directing a movie has
           to be just about the best job
           ever invented, but Marilyn has
           cured me of ever wanting to do it
           again.
          He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the
          lights come up.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           And now I'm going back to the
           theatre. John Osborne is writing
           a piece for me.

<b>                          COLIN

           find new worlds to conquer, if
           you want to be the best. And
           believe me, most of the time, I
           really am the best.
           He goes to the door and pauses.

<b>                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
</b>           You've done a good job, boy.
           (Pause) Welcome to the circus.
           He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Run it again, please.
           The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen,
           laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where
           Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene
           90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent.
           HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the
           darkness, then -

                         

<b>          152A INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY 152A
</b>
           The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing
           his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing
           the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head
           down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here.
           BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and
           regulars at play.
           And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and
           freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up
           as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action.
           COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to
           his woe and his pint.

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           Buy a girl a drink?
           COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Can I get another one of those
           please, Barry?
           BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not
           to stare.

           MARILYN hands COLIN a package.

</b>           The first time you saw this, all I
           had on was the radio.
           Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the
           first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE

<b>           MOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Everyone else doesn't understand.
           She smiles, touched.

<b>          152B EXT. DOG & DUCK PUB. DAY 152B
</b>
           The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens
           the car door for MARILYN.
           MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles
           and says lightly:

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           What's that for?

<b>                          MARILYN
</b>           That's for being on my side; and
           remember, when you see me wink,
           that's for you.
           ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.

</b>           (glancing at COLIN)
           Looking a couple of inches taller
           than when I first saw you.
           ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well
           done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he
           watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.

<b>                          BARRY
</b>           Was that really Marilyn Monroe?

</b>           No - just a good friend of mine.
           BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring
           at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it
           drives into the English countryside.

</b>
           COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat
           dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is
           little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and
           down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.
           We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.

                         

<b>          154 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. DAY. 154
</b>
           COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all
           over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves.
           A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own
           desk, glances at his diary, then looks up.

<b>                          COLIN
</b>           Any messages?
           THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.

<b>                          SECRETARY
</b>           It's probably just someone having
           a joke.
           COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles
           phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe.

           It is late. COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of
           paper.
           The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.

           hills.
           A white phone rings on the table.
           It rings continuously, insistently.
           It carries on ringing.
           No one comes.
           HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think
           Marilyn might appear, but she never does.
           It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As
           the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet
           echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz.

           drifts away to nothing.

                         

<b>          157 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 157
</b>
           COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn
           singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise
           has been revisiting it in his memory.
           He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going
           to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle
           in resignation.
           His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He
           stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they
           have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he
           is looking for - it says simply MM on the can.
           He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a
           Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends
           to look.
           The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her
           most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from
           The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by
           Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since
           forgotten.
           We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,
           looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.
           After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to
           where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks
           happily.
           Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet
           and charming.
           There is something so completely natural about the gesture
           COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and
           MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It
           moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen
           this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for
           years.
           It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,
           affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever
           his.
           She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without
           sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then
           looks back, smiling at the camera.
