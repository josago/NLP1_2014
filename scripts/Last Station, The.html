</b>
    Leo Tolstoy (80), sits writing on his lapboard. He is quite
    simply the greatest living writer in the world. His
    devotion to pacifism, his rejection of the trappings of
    Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince
    many to regard him as a living saint. With him are his much
    younger wife, the COUNTESS SOFYA, favorite daughter SASHA,
    and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY. Sasha and
    Dushan write in their diaries. Sofya looks from one to the
    next a little impatient. The train begins to slow.

<b>                        SOFYA
</b>              Why are we slowing down?

    No one responds. Slower. Slower.

<b>                        SOFYA
</b>              We're stopping. Why are we
              stopping?

<b>                        SASHA
</b>              I don't know, mother.    No idea.

    Tolstoy look up from his work, asks a passing conductor.

<b>                        SOFYA
</b>              Excuse me, why has the train
              stopped?

<b>                        CONDUCTOR
</b>              It's the crowd, ma'm, the people.
              They're blocking the track.

    In the distance we can here voices.

<b>                        VOICES (O.S.)
</b>              Long live Tolstoy! Long live the
              old warrior!

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>              But if they block the track, the
              train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKE
<b>              THEM MOVE.
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                            2.
</b>

    The conductor shrugs, walks away. She goes to the window to
    investigate. A crowd of a hundred peasants, students
    surround the engine, block the track. They carry a huge
    cloth banner honoring Tolstoy. We can hear voices chanting
    "Tolstoy. Tolstoy. Tolstoy", voices crying "You are the
    truth." "You are the hope of the Russian people."

<b>                        SOFYA
</b>              Oh, they won't move. We are
              gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and
              say something to them. It's the
              only way we are gonna get out of
              here.

    The chanting grows in intensity. Tolstoy gets to his feet,
    walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd. A great
    shout goes up. Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence.
    Gradually, it comes.

<b>                        TOLSTOY
</b>              I have seen your banner. And I´ve
              heard what you say. You think I´m
              the hope of Russia, do you? Well,
              that´s not true. You are the hope
              of Russia. The hope of all the
              world. You say, you want a new
              way to live? Well, you are not
              gonna find it making a fuss over
              me. So, I suggest that you get on
              with your work and let a poor old
              men get on with his.

    The cries begin. "Clear the tracks. Let them pass. Let them
    go." Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the
    train pulls away.

</b>
    On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away. We
    focus on a handsome young man, a little stiff maybe, a
    little intellectual. This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH
    BULGAKOV. He can't contain his enthusiasm. Over the noise
    of the train.

<b>                        VALENTIN
</b>              Do you know who that is? That is
              the greatest man in the world.

    The train pulls away into the distance.

     Muzhiks (peasants) gather wood, carry water to the house. A
     cart arrives loaded down with mail bags.

     A handsome room, walls covered with generations of family
     photographs. Religious icons are given pride of place, a
     testament, not to piety, but to an ingrained social
     conservatism, a certain position in the world.

     Countess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make
     shift altar. Wiping away tears, she leaves the room.


<b>5A   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY/STAIR. DAY.                     5A

     Sofya walks down the stairs and through the entry passed an
     old servant asleep in a chair. She continues to the
     basement.


<b>6    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. DAY.           6
</b>
     Tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors
     into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and
     study. The walls are bare except for a portrait of his
     daughter. The furniture is simple, some of it hand made: a
     small bed against the wall, a little writing desk in one
     corner stacked with books, littered with papers, more mail,
     opened and unopened. Pairs of rude homemade shoes line a
     work bench.

     Tolstoy sleeps in his bed. Though it's late March and
     still cold, the window is open. Sofya closes it. She
     stands very still, watching Tolstoy sleep. Sitting on the
     bed, she gently touches his hand, whispers.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>               Darling.

     She lies next to him, something girlish, hopeful in her
     face, as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her, but
     he sleeps on. She carefully takes his arm, positions it
     under her neck, and rolling toward him, wraps it around
     her. The image of love's intimacy, of wedded bliss.

     His hand slips off her shoulder, once, twice. She moves
     awkwardly to replace it. He moves a little toward her. She
     kisses his neck, his cheek. We don't know if he's awake,
     but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul.

</b>
    A handsome study in the Moscow townhouse of VLADIMIR
    GRIGOREVICH CHERTKOV, Tolstoy's most articulate and
    dedicated disciple. He's interviewing Tolstoy's newly
    appointed secretary, VALENTIN BULGAKOV, the young man we
    met near the train, who, at the mention of sex, blushes a
    little.

<b>                        CHERTKOV
</b>              But sex... You are twenty three.
              Not an easy age for abstinence,
              is it?

<b>                        VALENTIN
</b>              Tolstoy does not approve of
              sexual relations. I know this.

<b>                        CHERTKOV
</b>              He despises them, in fact...

    Chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax.

<b>                        CHERTKOV
</b>              I don't want to belabor the
              point, but I arranged for a
              manservant last year who
              proceeded to ruin two housemaids
              just like that. He was very
              upset.

<b>                        VALENTIN
</b>              This would not be a problem. I'm
              celibate. I'm also a strict
              vegetarian.

    Chertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache.

<b>                        CHERTKOV
</b>              Yes, I've heard many good things
              about you. I've even read what
              you`ve written. So has he.

    Valentin's face flushes with pride. Chertkov steals a
    glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase. One side of
    his moustache droops a little. He tugs awkwardly at it.

<b>                        CHERTKOV
</b>              My dear boy, if you were to
              become Tolstoy's private
              secretary, you would be given a
              great gift. You'll be with him
              every day, eat together, walk in
              the forest by his side.

    It's difficult to contain himself.

<b>                     VALENTIN
</b>          Believe me, since becoming a
          Tolstoyan, I have become so eager
          to learn, so comitted to
          discussing ideas, improving my
          very soul.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>              (smiling)
          Well, we have a lot to do if we
          are to get his work to the
          people.

<b>                     VALENTIN
</b>          We?

They both laugh.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          Yes, we. If we can encourage the
          spread of passive
          resistance...just think of it
          Valentin   thousands of ordinary
          Russians casting off centuries of
          spiritual and political
          oppression-

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          In the name of truth and freedom.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          Truth and freedom, yes but still,
          my boy, there are so many enemies-

<b>                     VALENTIN
</b>          Enemies?

Chertkov walks to the window, signals Valentin to follow
him. He points to

TWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES standing in the street below.

<b>                     CHERTKOV
</b>          The Czar's police...You'll be
          followed when you leave
          here...and the church will stop
          at nothing to bring him back into
          the fold. His children can't be
          trusted... only Sasha... and then
          of course there is the
          Countess...
              (beat)
          Well, one doesn't like to come
          between married people whatever
          the circumstances, but her dogged
          attachment to private property,
          her public criticism of our
          movement...

                     CHERTKOV (cont'd)
              (beat)
          The point is, he needs a man of
          your intellectual gifts around
          him. Someone who can help him
          with the new work. Someone who
          understands his goals.

Chertkov returns to the desk.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          And although they've allowed me
          to return to Russia, I can't see
          him. They keep me under house
          arrest... They might as well keep
          me in a cage.

Clearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself.
He picks up a package, hands it to Valentin.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          So, I need you to put these
          letters directly into his hands.
          One can't be sure what gets
          through to him.

Valentin looks at him, quizzical.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          Sofya Andreyevna does not respect
          his privacy.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          She wouldn't open his private
          correspondence...

Chertkov raises an eyebrow. An ominous silence.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          I have another task for you, my
          dear.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          Please.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          You'll keep a diary for me.

He hands Valentin a notebook.

<b>                     CHERTKOV
</b>          I need to know everything that
          goes on at Yasnaya Polyana. Let
          me know who visits the house, any
          talk of the copyright to his
          work, any contact with the
          church, what letters come and go.

<b>                         CHERTKOV

     Valentin makes his way to the droshky that awaits him.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               And remember what I said.

     He turns back to the dark figure in the doorway.

     Where Tolstoy, awake and dressed, sits on his bed, pen in

He puts Tolstoy's arm down and hands him his riding boot.
Sofya comes ranting into the room carrying several Russian
and international dailies.

<b>                    SOFYA

          "Countess Tolstoy has become
          estranged from her husband. They

She throws the paper on the floor.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          You know who spreads all this
          rubbish....

She opens another paper, a French daily.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          C'est la meme en France. They
          gossip about us in Paris... "They

She looks at Dushan who is transcribing every word into his
diary. He does it with all the master's conversations.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          What are you doing? Don't do

Tolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door.

     Something strikes him. He walks to his desk, picks up his
     pen and quickly writes a sentence on a scrap of paper.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               Leovochka, why do you insist on
               dressing like that.

</b>               It's not meant to offend you.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               But it does offend me, because it
               offends reason. You're a Count,
               for God's sake.

     He puts his pen down, goes to her, kisses her gently on the
     forehead and leaves the room.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               Oh darling, I have something else
               to say.

</b>               He's forgotten his coat.

     He runs after him, tripping over the long fur garment.

</b>               Count Tolstoy, you've forgotten
               your coat.

     Meanwhile Sofya notices a photographic portrait of Chertkov
     on the wall. She takes it down and tosses it in the
     corner.

     As Tolstoy appears on the porch, we hear the WHIR of
     cameras. A crowd of photographers, film cameramen,
     journalists, and disciples try to catch a glimpse of the
     master. Dushan steps in front of him.

<b>                    JOURNALIST
</b>          Count Tolstoy, you're no doubt
          distressed by the Czar's
          treatment of your secretary
          Nikolai Gusev ?

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          These people are bandits.

<b>                    DUSHAN

          arrest a man whose only crime is
          to express a view of life saner
          than that which prevails.



<b>                    JOURNALIST
</b>          So Gusev is innocent?

<b>                     TOLSTOY
</b>              (nods)
          Of course, I'm the guilty one. I
          reject the Orthodox church. I
          condemn the established order and
          I make no secret of it.

A young peasant shouts from the crowd.

<b>                    PEASANT
</b>          God bless you, Tolstoy. Thank
          you.

          I had your largeness of spirit.

A photographer's flash goes off. An old Muzhik touches
Tolstoy's sleeve, as if expecting a miracle.

Sasha, her father's soulmate, leads two horses toward them,
her mount and her father's black gelding, Delire.

     Valentin in his buttoned up suit looks a little out of
     place in the overcrowded third class carriage. He writes in
     the diary given him by Chertkov. He glances up to see, on

     nurse her baby. He blushes, doesn't know where to look. An
     old peasant catches his eye, winks at him, laughs.

     Seven miles from Tolstoy's estate, this is Telyatinki, a
     communal center created by Chertkov dedicated to the study
     and practice of Tolstoyism.

<b>                         SERGEYENKO
</b>               Telyatinki was created by
               Vladimir Grigorevich as a center
               for the movement. Just last week
               we had a visitor from India. We
               talked to the group about the
               healing properties of cobra
               venum.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Oh, goodness..It's a beautiful
               day.

<b>                         SERGEYENKO
</b>               Yes, but we will pay for it.


     Sergeyenko, Chertkov's joyless secretary, and Valentin
     stand on a second storey porch looking out across the
     central lawn where a number of young Tolstoyans tend the
     garden, work to put up a chicken coop.

     They enter the building.

<b>                         SERGEYENKO
</b>               Telyatinki is a place of freedom.
               Nothing is forbidden here.

     Except everything.

<b>                          SERGEYENKO

     Small, sparse, perfect for the novice ascetic.   Valentin
     nods his approval.

               that you begin your reports as
               soon as possible. You have the
               notebook he gave you?

<b>                            VALENTIN
</b>               Of course.

<b>                         SERGEYENKO
</b>               You understand we must keep the
               existence of the diary a secret.

     Valentin smiles.

<b>                         SERGEYENKO
</b>               What is it?

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Just that...secrecy doesn't seem
               to me the essence of Tolstoy's
               thought.

<b>                         SERGEYENKO
</b>               But you'll admit, you're no
               expert.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Yes, I...I'll see you in the
               morning.

<b>                         SERGEYENKO
</b>               If we're spared.

     Sergeyenko leaves Valentin to his bare, little room.

<b>                            VALENTIN
</b>               Come in.

     A lovely girl at his door. She's tall, twenties, high cheek
     bones, short blonde hair. This is MASHA.
<b>
</b><b>                                                     14.

</b>          That's very kind of you.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          It's your first day. Enjoy it.

She sits on the bed. He's a little taken aback, not used to
this degree of familiarity. It makes no impression on
Masha.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          You met Sergeyenko?

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          Last night.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Ad what do you think?

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          He seems very sincere.

Masha hands him his tea.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          Thank you. Why are you laughing?

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Say that again.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          I said he seems very... Why?

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Is that what you think?

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          I just arrived...What's your
          name?

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Masha. But you should still say
          what you think. Not just about
          him. We all should.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          Thank you for the tea.

Their eyes meet, hold. Valentin's discomfort increases.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Tomorrow you can make your own.

She walks to the door, turns to see him still watching her.

     A modest horse drawn cart. Valentin sits beside the driver,
     contemplates the birch trees that line the road, the long
     shadows they cast. Above, crows make lazy circles in the
     sky.

</b>               Papa's out. You can wait in the
               library. Ivan will show you up.

     She disappears. He hears a door close. He notices a surly
     house servant, IVAN, who, inexplicably, leads a goat
     through the house. He points upstairs and walks away.

     Alone now among Tolstoy's books, Valentin makes his way
     slowly to a writing table, the holy of holies, on which War
     and Peace and Anna Karenina were written. He runs his hand
     along the old wood top. Emboldened by a backward glance, he
     sits in Tolstoy's chair. Before him are stacks of letters,
     pens and pencils, a pot of India ink. There's a notebook
     lying open. He leans forward to read it. A noise in the
     hall stops him.

     Tolstoy enters from the dining room, red cheeked, beard
     dripping wet, the energy of a man ten years younger than he
     is. Valentin stands.

<b>                         TOLSTOY

He tromps across the room, kisses the boy enthusiastically
on both cheeks. Valentin is overcome by the great man's
warmth.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          I'm... I'm... Here is-

Valentin interrupts himself with a sneeze.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          God bless you.

<b>                       VALENTIN
</b>          I'm sorry.     Sometimes I...

Valentin pulls out a letter of introduction. Tolstoy takes
it out and puts it down without a glance.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          Vladimir Grigorevich has already
          written about you at length. I
          need your help badly. The
          manifesto against the government
          is hard work. They commit their
          idiotic abuses faster than I can
          catalogue them...and the new
          book...

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          He told me about it...It's very
          exciting.

Tolstoy nods.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          I've become convinced that all
          the world's religions have a
          single organizing principle. Can
          you guess what it is? Love!
          Love! Simple... Now, I want to
          talk about you. How are you? How
          was your journey? Come, sit
          down.

Tolstoy sits on the old sofa. Valentin follows suit.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          You know, I was born on this
          sofa...

Valentin gets right back up. Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa.

<b>                       TOLSTOY
</b>          Sit. Sit.

Valentin sits down.

     Valentin looks into the great man's kind old face. He tries
     to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep.

<b>                          TOLSTOY
</b>               My boy, what is it?
                   (beat)
               I upset you in some way. Was it
               the sofa? It's only a sofa.

     Valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               I'm very happy. You are very
               kind. I'm no one and you are...
               you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask
               me about my work.

     Tolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               You rest for a moment and I'll
               fetch you a glass of tea. Rest,
               because there's work for both of
               us together.

     He smiles and goes, leaving Valentin to contemplate his
     fortune.

</b>           It really is the most
           extraordinary thing.

Absolutely ignoring him.

<b>                     SOFYA
</b>           It's not for lack of land that
           the muzhiks live in poverty.
           They have no will power and they
           drink too much.

<b>                     TOLSTOY
</b>           I'm not suggesting they be given
           land. Private property is the
           root of the problem... We should
           be giving ours away.

<b>                     ANDREY
</b>           Give it to whom?

<b>                     SOFYA
</b>           It's all ridiculous. You think
           that poverty makes the peasants
           somehow morally superior.

<b>                     TOLSTOY
</b>           I believe that wealth corrupts us
           all, yes I do.

A pause.   Valentin fills the silence.

<b>                     VALENTIN
</b>           It's a keystone of the movement.

<b>                     SOFYA
</b>           Oh, I know all about the
           movement.

A pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn
have moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the
Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care.

<b>                     TOLSTOY
</b>           If the peasants had money, they
           wouldn't surround themselves, as
           we do, with footmen costing ten
           rubles a month.

<b>                     SOFYA
</b>           No, they'd spend it on drink and
           whores.

<b>                     TOLSTOY
</b>           Valentin Fedorovich, do you think
           fifty years from now, people will
           eat while grown men walk around
           and wait on them hand and foot?

Valentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan.

<b>                    DUSHAN
</b>          Oh, that's good...that's good.

Dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get
down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table.
Sofya flushes with anger.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          I think...(sneeze)

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          Stop scribbling!
              (points to her husband)
          You all think he's Christ, don't
          you? He thinks he's Christ.

There is an awkward pause.

<b>                    DUSHAN
</b>              (flustered)
          I'm not...I don't believe Leo
          Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is
          Christ but...

<b>                      SOFYA
</b>          But what?

<b>                    DUSHAN
</b>          I believe he's one of the
          prophets. God speaks through him.
          I recognize the cadence in his
          voice.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          This is unbearable. No wonder I
          feel lonely. I'm surrounded by
          morrons.

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          Mama, you're being ridiculous.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          Am I? I sit here and listen to
          this talk of love and God and
          equality, knowing full well that
          Count Generosity here is fully
          prepared to give away everything
          we have.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>              (exhausted)
          You keep going on like that...Why
          do you think we should profit
          from the work I´m doing which is
          only meant for the sake of the
          people.

</b><b>                                                       20.

She turns to see Dushan scribbling again.

<b>                     SOFYA
</b><b>          STOP IT!   STOP WRITING NOW!
</b>
Valentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these
outbursts. A long pause. Dushan tries to relieve the
tension.

<b>                    DUSHAN
</b>          In defense of my gift, let me
          demonstrate. It's quite
          remarkable, really.

He gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on
the record. What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's
voice.

It is a recording of a recent speech against capital
punishment. His voice booms, tinny and distorted. Dushan
walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. Valentin is
completely caught up in the technology.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          It's your voice. It's wonderful.

They all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a
response.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          It's tiresome. Another
          remarkable invention will
          supercede it.

Valentin blushes and looks at the table. Dushan tries to
hide his disappointment.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          Please excuse me.

Tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn.
Dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. Tea
spills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of
irritable blessings.

<b>                    DUSHAN
</b>          Leo Nikolayevich is something of
          a Luddite, I fear.

Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the
gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought.

Suddenly, the air is filled with   the final duet from
Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She   returns to her place.
There is a long moment where all   take in the sublimity of
it. Tolstoy walks slowly back to   the table. He stands
completely still. Tears fill his   eyes and roll down his
cheeks.

</b>

<b>                          TOLSTOY
</b>                Oh, that´s better. That´s nice.
                Very nice indeed.

     Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face.
     Valentin watches as they embrace.

</b>
     Across from Tolstoy's writing desk is Sasha's world, a
     makeshift office lined with more bookcases where she does
     her work, sending cables, editing manuscripts, answering
     endless stacks of mail. Valentin sits near her, learning
     the ropes.

<b>                           SASHA
</b>                My mother doesn't understand my
                father's goals, not since his
                work as a novelist became
                secondary.    His commitment to
                the spiritual life offends her.
                They've fought about it for
                years.

<b>                          VALENTIN
</b>                I'm sure she means well.

     Sasha just looks at him.

<b>                          VALENTIN
</b>                Your father is the greatest
                writer in the world.

<b>                          SASHA
</b>                Quite.

     A pause.

<b>                          VALENTIN
</b>                I mean to say, I feel privileged
                to be here. It's an... honor.

     Valentin feels himself slip further into mundanity. Sasha
     goes back to her letter.   Valentin SNEEZES.

<b>                          SASHA
</b>                God Bless You.

     They read together for a moment.   He sneezes again.

               when I'm nervous.

     She regards him like an animal in the zoo. Ivan appears at
     the door.

     He nods toward Valentin.

<b>                         SASHA
</b>               Well, give it to him then.

     Valentin reads the note.

     Sofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining
     room. Valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               I see a fine young man before me.
               Clear eyes. Nice features, rather
               handsome in a peculiar way.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Thank you, Countess...

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>               Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We
               don't stand on formality here, as

               Many young men ruin their looks

<b>                         VALENTIN

Sofya drains her tea cup, signals for more.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          He's very grateful for the help
          you've been giving him. He told
          me so himself. I think it
          surprises him that a young man
          would be so diligent. When he was
          your age, he was whoring in the
          Caucasus.

Valentin's eyes are wide. She nods.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          He wrote it all down. He even
          gave me a copy, so I could read

Sofya smiles at his honesty.

</b>          When he was writing it, long
          before Chertkov created that

          revolutionary nonsense...

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          But you see what a fool he is, a
          self-serving puritanical idiot. I
          have to say, it's been extremely

          his handwriting. I could read his
          intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd
          drink tea and discuss changes.
          "Natasha wouldn't say that to
          Prince Andrey," or "Pierre's too
          simple here. He's not stupid."

She smiles at the memory.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          But I don't count anymore.

Silence. She sips her tea. She glances out the door to see
Sasha hovering nearby. Listening? Sasha walks away.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          You must help me, Valentin

          situation if it only concerned me
          What I can not do is sit back
          while they steal my children's
          inheritance. Do you know I was
          the only person. I could
          understand his intention.

<b>                    VALENTIN

Sofya gives him a condescending smile. She produces a
package from the table beside her, hands it to him.

He opens it, extracts a small leather bound book. He stares
at it.

     Valentin rides into the compound. A number of the disciples
     are outside working. There is the ringing of metal on
     wood. He looks for the source. As the way clears a little,
     he sees Masha chopping away with an axe. He stops his horse
     to watch her.

<b>                         MASHA

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               He didn't need me this afternoon.

     He gets down off his horse. Masha continues to chop. He
     picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly.

<b>                          VALENTIN

     She laughs. Valentin picks up a log, sets it on end and
     begins to chop. He doesn't do it well. Masha smiles at his
     struggle.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               He admires you, I believe.

The log is stuck to the blade of his axe. He's really
struggling now.

He looks up to see Masha smiling at him.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          And what relations are these?

Valentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping. Almost
immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe.
He bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. He glances up to
see her still looking at him. He pounds again and again.

She stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does.
She lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head,
bringing it down hard. The log splits. She hands the axe to
him.

          where I taught. He was married -
          happily married. It was
          difficult. We could make love
          only at school.

This is somehow more than Valentin had bargained for.

<b>                       VALENTIN
</b>          At school?

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          In the gymnasium, after the girls
          had gone. There were straw mats
          on the floor.

<b>                       VALENTIN
</b>          I see...

He looks away to hide his confusion.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Have I upset you?

He looks at her.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          No...I appreciate your frankness

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          But you disapprove of me. I see
          it in your eyes.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          I don't. Not at all...I think
          sexual activity...how men and
          women combine their physical
          parts is completely neutral.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Listen to you. You're a prig.
          Just like Sergeyenko. Why else
          would they have hired you?

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          That's not fair

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          I don't care if it's fair. It's
          true...neutral...my God...

<b>                       VALENTIN
</b>          I'm going.

He puts down the axe.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Do as you like.

She goes back to chopping. We track in front of him as he
walks toward the house. The chopping stops.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Valentin Fedorovich.

He stops, relieved and turns to face her.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          You forgot your horse.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          Yes. You know, I think that I...
          never mind.

He hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. Her back
is to him. She begins to chop again. The color rises in his
face as he tries to salvage a little dignity.

      He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings,
      trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. Red faced, he rights
      himself. The chopping behind him remains constant.
      Sergeyenko watches him from the porch.

      Valentin sneezes.

<b>                          TOLSTOY
</b>                God bless...I've never forgotten

</b>                You shouldn't torture yourself.

Tolstoy smiles.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          You see, I myself am not a very
          good Tolstoyan. You should think

          old woman now, white hair, old
          body like me. She'd hardly
          remember my name, I suspect. She
          may even be dead. (beat) Do you
          think that meant something?

          there some meaning to it?

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          It´s interesting. I think you
          would say..I mean, I´ve read
          where you say that the physical
          body isn´t real. That it´s all an
          illusion.

<b>                    TOLSTOY

          say? What do you think?

               There seems to be some confusion.

</b>               You send me never ending
               commentary on Tolstoy's writing.
               That's all very interesting but
               not very useful. I need to know
               what goes on with Sofya
               Andreyevna. You must see by now
               she's committed to undermining
               her husband's best intentions.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               It's not quite so obvious to me.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               Because she is duplicitous. You
               are very bright. Too bright to
               let her into you.

<b>                         VALENTIN

<b>                          CHERTKOV
</b>               Good, of course it is. (beat) Do
               you think the Countess suspects
               something?

</b>               Well, I think the Countess is
               very suspicios by nature.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               How so?

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               I don´t think she likes you very
               much.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               What does she say?

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               It´s a tone I´ve picked up.

<b>                          CHERTKOV
</b>               We simply want to distribute
               Tolstoy's work to the widest
               audience possible. She just has
               no understanding what it is we
               are trying to do. There´s nothing
               in it for any of us but a real
               chance to increase the world´s
               happiness.

     He takes Valentin's hand.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               I can only be of limited help to
               the master if I don't know what's
               going on. Any effort she makes to

</b>               Ssshh.

     She begins to move against him. Their faces touch. She
     doesn't kiss him, but he can feel her breath. She sits up.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               Move the book.

<b>                            VALENITN

<b>                            MASHA
</b>               Your book.

     It's true. Valentin still clutches the diary to his chest.
     He puts it aside. Masha, then, pulls her nightdress over
     head, exposing her small breasts, her flat stomach.

     She reaches under the sheets, curls her fingers around him.
     He flinches at the pleasure of it.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               Is it alright?

     He can't speak. Only nod. He bites his lip as she slips him
     into her and begins to rock. The pleasure is too much, and
     he comes too quickly. She falls forward on him, begins to
     laugh.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               What...what is it?

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               You really are a virgin.

     Valentin tenses a little.

<b>                          MASHA
</b>               I'm playing. It's fine. It's
               wonderful...
                   (beat)
               Hold me.

     He does, as if he'll never release her.

     around naked Masha.

<b>                         MASHA

      Masha smiles.

<b>                          MASHA
</b>                You mean, why does someone who
                doesn't follow the rules come to
                a place like this?

<b>                          MASHA
</b>                ..it's not about rules.    Not for

     A Tolstoyan photo op. A delegation of orphans have come to
     pay their respects to Tolstoy. He sits in a chair beside
     Chertkov beneath a large banner : "Leo Tolstoy, Friend of
     the People.". Behind him, the disciples lay out a
     vegetarian feast on a plank table. Photographers and a
     cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the
     event.

     Each child gives Tolstoy a flower. Chertkov, in turn, hands
     each child a photograph of the Count giving money to the
     poor.

     Valentin enters, flushed and blushing. He pauses beside
     Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his
     eyes.

<b>                         DUSHAN
</b>               Look at the love in him, like
               Jesus..suffering the
               children...all that...

     Tolstoy greets a little boy affectionately, rubs his
     knuckles over the boy's shaved head. A little girl
     approaches, takes a photograph. He bends forward to kiss
     her head but she pulls away.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               An old man is a very ugly thing.

     Tolstoy sees Valentin, lights up.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               My dear boy. Come and kiss me.

     Valentin, beet red, goes to him. He is warmly embraced.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        38.

<b>                     TOLSTOY
</b>          Now, who is this? Maria
          Filipovna.

Masha comes to stand beside him. She glances at Valentin
but he won't make eye contact with her.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          You're both looking so well. Life
          here at Telyatinki obviously
          agrees with you.

Valentin sneezes mightily, moves a little away.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          God bless you, boy. What are you
          nervous about, now? Sit down. Sit
          down.

Valentin takes the chair beside him.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          Dear Masha, Valentin tells me
          you're the great treasure of
          Telyatinki. He claims you're a
          very gifted teacher.

Sergeyenko lifts an eyebrow "Indeed.". Valentin is in
agony.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          We're happy to have you with us.

Tolstoy notices a mosquito on Valentin's cheek. He takes
the bug between his big fingers, squeezes until it pops.
Chertkov watches in horror, whispers loudly.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          What do you mean?

He motions to the photographers.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          You've killed a living thing.

Chertkov hears a laugh behind him.   It is Masha who has
over heard the whole thing.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          Do you have something to say?

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          It's absurd. That's all.

Chertkov is taken aback.   Valentin stares at her.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            39.
</b>

<b>                         VALENTIN

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               I'm sorry but- It's a mosquito.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Forgive him. He can't help it.
               He's a better Tolstoyan than I
               am.

     She can't help laughing again. Valentin sees the color rise
     in Chertkov's face.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               It's not the message we want to
               send.

     Sasha suddenly appears. She holds a cable in her hand.

<b>                         SASHA
</b>               From my mother "Nerves dreadful.

               that woman has an instinct for
               knowing when you're just about to
               enjoy yourself

     A knock on the door. Valentin opens it. It's Dushan with
     another cable. Tolstoy gestures for him to read it aloud.

<b>                         DUSHAN
</b>               From Sofya Andreyevna. "I beg

</b>               Who taught her to use that damned
               machine?

     Valentin starts to sneeze, stifles it, starts again,
     stifles, starts, explodes. Guilty.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               Perhaps Sasha's right.
               Encouraging this may not be the
               best thing.

<b>                         SASHA
</b>               It's a trick, Papa. She'll drain
               you. You'll be miserable.

     Tolstoy looks from one to the other, gets up from his
     chair.

<b>                         SASHA
</b>               Then, let me go with you.

<b>                         TOLSTOY

     Close on Sofya lying in bed. She looks ravishing in the
     candle light. In the background, Tolstoy arrives in the
     bedroom door.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Sofya.

     A sly smile on her lips, the tension gone from her face,
     she seems twenty years younger.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Sofya, are you ill?

     She rolls toward him making it clear she's quite naked
     under the sheets. This is no sick bed.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               I'm fine...now that you're home.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               It's no good, you know, all this.
               You frightened everyone.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               Did I really? I don't believe
               it. Not you. I'm your little

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               That was some sort of love call?

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               It brought you back to me.

     She reaches out her hand to him.

<b>                          TOLSTOY
</b>                Why? Why? Why, do you do it? We
                live in the country and you
                insist on making it an opera
                house. What's wrong with a little
                peace now and then?

      Sofya laughs.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                Let me make you crow.

      A pause, then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of
      him. He twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows
      like a rooster.

      He virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her. She is
      a giddy girl in his arms. He breaks the embrace and begins
      strutting around the room.

<b>                          SOFYA

      He takes her in his arms, again, begins to kiss her neck.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                Do you love me?

</b>                I want you to love me.

      He stops kissing her, looks her in the eye. Then, another
      loud crow. Laughing, they fall into each other again.

     Valentin sits by himself on the porch, writes in his diary.
     Down below, some of the disciples listen to peasants play
     music around a bonfire. A voice from the darkness.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               I'm not supposed to do this
               either.

     He locates the speaker by the glow of her lit cigarette.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Masha. You are not supposed to

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               You wouldn't look at me.

</b>               It was difficult in front of the

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               But it wasn't difficult in your
               bed... When it was only you and
               me in front of God.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               I'm not sure I was conscious of
               God.

     Masha emerges from the shadows, but keeps her distance.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               So, I made you forget God?

<b>                         VALENTIN

<b>                         MASHA

               other-- stayed close together.
               Something passed between us.
               Something real. That is a
               betrayal of what? Of nothing.

     She comes through the dining room to find Tolstoy on the
     back terrace. Wrapped in a blanket, he writes in his diary,
     a cup of tea in front of him.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               Good morning, my darling? Do you
               mind if I join you?

     Without looking up

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Of course, my dear.

     He continues to write. She watches him for a long moment.
     She opens her diary and begins to write as well.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               It's quite insane, my darling.
               Everyone is making fun of you.

     He looks up.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               What are you talking about?

     She continues to write.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               Even the muzhiks. I heard them
               laughing in the barn.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               About what?

     Sofya looks at him knowingly.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          I don't want to ruin last night.

She sips her tea, goes back to her writing. A pause. He
follows suit. After a moment...

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          Laughing about the fact that
          you've developed a senile crush
          on a fat middle aged flatterer.
          Your passion for Chertkov has
          become a standing joke.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          I have a great affection for
          Vladimir Grigorivich. Let them
          laugh if they find it amusing.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          But it's not amusing, darling.
          It's sick. It's not normal. You
          hang on his every word.

<b>                    TOLSTOY

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          You have nothing in common. You
          are a genius. He's a sycophant
          and a pervert.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          Because he understands what I'm
          trying to do? Because he tries
          to help me accomplish it?

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          He is using you. You just can't
          seem to see it.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          This is absolute nonsense.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          That bold, obese, idiotic man.
          You treat him...

He turns to her...his face red with anger and frustration.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          It's impossible for you not to
          distract me. Let me alone... for
          God's sake. You're like a spoiled
          child.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                The new will.

<b>                          TOLSTOY

          understands and shares his
          ideals. All I want is what's

          from your husband.

<b>                    SOFYA

</b>            Fine...fine...Why did you...?

<b>                      VALENTIN
</b>            I came back as soon as I could.
            It was a strange day. Leo
            Nikolayevich,...I love to listen
            to him. I love nothing more...

He moves closer to her.

<b>                      VALENTIN
</b>            But today I could hardly
            concentrate.

He's very close to her, now.

<b>                      VALENTIN
</b>            All I could think of was you.

Masha shakes her head, moves away from him. Begins to
gather the pole, to refill the spilled bucket. Stops her,
turns her to him.

<b>                      VALENTIN
</b>            What's wrong?

<b>                      MASHA
</b>            I think I've confused you. I've
            confused us both.

<b>                      VALENTIN
</b>            No. No. You didn´t confuse me..I
            was stupid. I was afraid, but I'm
            not afraid anymore.

Valentin wants to fight through the awkwardness. He tries
to kiss her. She won't have it. She pulls away.

<b>                      VALENTIN
</b>            I love you, Masha!

<b>                      MASHA
</b>            Maybe you could help me a little.

In silence, he gets the filled buckets balanced on the
pole. Without another word, Masha starts toward the
buildings. He doesn't know what to do. He's losing her. He
shouts.

<b>                       VALENTIN

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Before the other night...I'd
               committed the act of copulation
               many times in my heart.

     He has her attention now, as well as that of a number of
     the disciples who look up from their work in the yard.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               Yes...

               In my heart I´ve comitted the act
               of copulation many times. I just
               want to say...It was never like
               it was with you.

     Masha bursts out laughing.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               I'll wait for you, then.

     As Valentin goes to catch her up, he sees Sergeyenko
     watching from outside the unfinished chicken coop.

     Sofya wakes up. She looks relaxed, then she sniffs, sniffs
     again. Out of bed, she grabs a dressing gown. Opening her
     door, she spots Ivan in the hall.

      little clump by his desk. Tolstoy his head in his hands,
      looks at the floor.

</b>                Not dangerous... She's concerned

      Sofya, still in her dressing gown, climbs out her bedroom
      window onto a narrow ledge that runs along the second
      floor.

     Sofya moves along the narrow ledge as if it's a perfectly
     normal activity.. Looking down, she sees a couple of
     gawkers watching her from the lawn. She shoos them away.

     Chertkov drives the point home.

</b>               But you're more than a husband

     Valentin glances up...and is shocked to see SOFYA LOOKING
     IN AT THE STUDY WINDOW. She disappears.

</b>               She's unstable...I wonder if she
               isn't ill.

<b>                         DUSHAN
</b>               It´s sadly more than possible.

</b>               I know it´s hard for you, papa.
               But we must be realistic.

     We pan to the french doors to see Sofya furious face as she
     listens to the betrayal.

<b>                         CHERTKOV (O.S.)

               the will?

     We pan back to the conspirators. Before Tolstoy can
     respond, Sofya charges into the room. As she does, she
     steps on the hem of her long dressing gown and ends up
     sprawled on the floor. The conspirators just stare at her.

<b>                         SOFYA

to take this down in his diary.

She rips the book away and after brandishing it above her
head, throws it through the open doors with a guttural,
rumbling growl. She turns on her tormentors.

</b>               Why can't my husband see you for
               what you are?

     Chertkov's face is red. He starts to speak, stops. He walks
     to the door, then very deliberately.

<b>                           CHERTKOV

     He leaves the room. Sofya sinks back to the floor, a flower
     wilting. She begins to weep. An Aria from Madame Butterfly
     comes over

     From a record on the gramophone. The table is set for ten,
     although no one is at dinner but Sofya Andreyevna and

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          Dushan says you're killing me.

Sofya rises up in cold rage.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          Then go! Go! Anywhere you please!

She smashes a plate on the table to punctuate it and
another and another.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          I hate you. I hate what you've
          become.

She picks up another plate, lets it fall. Now, she acts as
if she's choking or gasping for breath.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          Countess...Are you alright?

She fights with her collar, rips open the front of her
dress.

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>              (shouts)
<b>          DUSHAN!!!
</b>
<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          You'll destroy me.

Dushan runs into the room. Sofya continues to tear at her
clothes, stops, begins to pant, then falls to the floor in
a faint.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          60.
</b>

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Is she alright?

     Tolstoy tries to answer, but is overcome by a coughing fit.
     Dushan starts toward him but Tolstoy waves him in the
     direction of Sofya. He kneels beside her.

<b>                         DUSHAN
</b>               Sofya! Open your eyes.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               My back. My back... I'm hurting.

<b>                         DUSHAN
</b>               You're lying on a fork. Sit up
               and you'll improve
               markedly...Valentin, help to get
               her upstairs, would you?

     Valentin helps Sofya to her feet. Dushan gets up himself
     and walks to Tolstoy.

<b>                         DUSHAN
</b>               She's alright. I'm more concerned
               for you... We should all go to
               bed before something else
               happens.

     It's late. The house is quiet. Valentin walks into the
     kitchen to see Masha washing the dishes. Exhausted, he
     sits, stares at the floor.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               It was terrible there today...
               between them. They loved each
               other so much, but you see what
               it becomes.

     She stays at the sink, says nothing.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Masha, what´s the matter?

     She speaks without turning to him.

</b>          I'm going back to Moscow.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          What?

He gets up, goes to her.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          Chertkov spoke with me this
          afternoon. He says I could be
          more useful there...which
          means...

Valentin shakes his head. His lip trembles.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          This is him punishing us,
          punishing me for befriending
          Sofya Andreyevna. For not...
          This is Chertkov.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          We've both disappointed him.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          I don't care. You can't go away.
          I'll talk to him. I'll make him
          change his mind. i´m going to
          make you stay.

<b>                    MASHA

</b>          What?

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          I'm leaving the movement.

<b>                    VALENTIN
</b>          You can´t leave Tolstoy.

<b>                    MASHA
</b>          I am not. Look, when I read his
          Confession, it moved me, Valya.
          He was searching for freedom.
          Freedom from anger. Freedom from
          attachment. Freedom from all the
          superstition and nonsense of the
          church. It moved me so much. I
          thought that's what it would be
          about. Isn't that what it's
          about? Freedom and love? But
          they mix it all up.

Masha reaches out and puts her arms around him. Her head
falls against his shoulder.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               Come with me. Please.

     Bulgakov doesn't know what to say. The silence gets more
     awkward as it gets longer. Slowly, she disengages herself
     from him,looks him in the eye. She nods.

<b>                         MASHA
</b>               I'm going to my room.

     As she starts away.

</b>               Don't leave me, Masha...
               I need you.

     She turns back for a moment.

<b>                         MASHA

     Then she's gone.

</b>
     Sofya in her bed. A team of doctors hover over her. One of
     them peers into her eyes with a sextant-like instrument.

     We move into the hall to find DR. ROSSOLIMO, an expert in
     mental illness, conferring in the hall with Tolstoy and
     Dushan.

<b>                         ROSSOLIMO
</b>               I believe the Countess suffers
               from a mental degeneracy,
               paranoic and hysterical, chiefly
               the former.

<b>                           DUSHAN
</b>               Yes.

     The doctor walks back into the bedroom. Tolstoy red in the
     face, walks away down the hall. Dushan catches him.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Why did you bring him here?

<b>                          DUSHAN
</b>               He's an old friend, you know,
               from Rome.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               And astoundingly stupid in the
               way of all scientists.

     Dushan is wounded by his uncharacteristic lack of
     generosity.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          63.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               I'm sorry, my friend, but this is
               all very upsetting to me.

<b>                         DUSHAN
</b>               Yes.

     Tolstoy sits on a small staircase at the end of the hall.
     Bulgakov is already there on the step above him.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Take them downstairs. Thank them
               for me. Offer them a drink.

<b>                         DUSHAN
</b>               You'll be alright?

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Valentin Fedorovich will stay
               with me, won't you, boy

     Valentin nods. Dushan goes to collect the doctors.

     MOMENTS LATER-Tolstoy goes to Sofya's bed. He takes her
     hand. She looks at him with all the love of a new bride.
     Tears come to his eyes. He kisses her hand.

<b>                         SOFYA
</b>               Ya...your...your...I can´t
               remember now...Yo, what did I
               say? What did you mean?

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               You rest now.

     Valentin watches from the doorway as Tolstoy leaves the
     bedside and walks out.

     It is an autumn afternoon. Valentin and Tolstoy pick their
     way through the thick undergrowth.

     As they come into a clearing. Valentin is surprised to see
     a portable table and several chairs set up like lawyers
     office in the middle of the wood. Sergeyenko fiddles with a
     piece of paper on the desk. Chertkov comes toward them.

     Tolstoy stops his horse. He turns to Valentin with tears in
     his eyes.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               You see, I no longer feel I have
               a choice in the matter. She
               isn't...

     He rides forward toward the approaching Chertkov.
<b>
</b><b>                                                      64.
</b>

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          Good afternoon, Leo Nikolayevich.

<b>                       TOLSTOY
</b>          Is it?

They help Tolstoy dismount. They lead him to a nearby stump
and place the writing board before him. Sergeyenko hands a
document to Chertkov who lays it on the board.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          This will insure that the
          complete works will live in the
          public domain.

<b>                    SERGEYENKO
</b>          Monumentous.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          Your work is the birthright of
          the Russian people. Now, they
          possess it forever.

Tolstoy looks up at them.

<b>                       CHERTKOV
</b>          Yes?

<b>                    TOLSTOY
</b>          I need a pen.

<b>                       CHERTKOV
</b>          Of course.

Chertkov looks at Sergeyenko who swallows hard. No pen.

<b>                       SERGEYENKO
</b>          I...uh...

<b>                       CHERTKOV
</b>          What?

Sergeyenko moves close to Chertkov, close enough to
whisper.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          You're a secretary.       How can you
          not have a pen?

Sergeyenko points at Valentin.

<b>                    SERGEYENKO
</b>          He's a secretary, too.      Ask him.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          Valentin Fedorovich, do you have
          a pen?
<b>
</b><b>                                                             65.
</b>

     Valentin hesitates for a moment, looks at Tolstoy, seated
     on the stump, staring into the middle distance.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               I do.

     Valentin fetches it from his satchel.

     Pen in hand, Tolstoy hovers over the document. A long
     moment.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               Are you alright?

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               I feel like a conspirator.

     Sergeyenko laughs. Chertkov glares at him. It's beyond
     awkward. Valentin looks to the sky, sees the crows
     circling again.

     Without further hesitation, Tolstoy picks up the pen and
     signs the document. Then he moves away from the group.
     Valentin watches him.

     Valentin and Tolstoy water their horses at a stream.
     Tolstoy seems weary.

<b>                          VALENTIN
</b>               Maybe we should get back. It'll
               be dark soon. May I ask you
               something that has nothing to do
               with work?

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Of course, my dear.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Do you love your wife?

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               " Your youth and your desire for
               happiness reminds me cruelly of
               my age and the impossibility of
               happiness for me." When I was
               courting Sofya, she was so young
               and pure, it seemed impossible
               that I'd ever have her.
               I didn't want to tell her how I
               felt and I wanted to tell her
               nothing else. So I wrote down a
               string of letters and asked her
               if she could decipher them. She
               looked completely confused,
               thinking it was a game or...

</b><b>                                                              66.
</b>

     Tolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his
     love.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               I gave her one clue. The first
               two Y's, I said, stand for "your
               youth" and then the most
               miraculous thing happened. She
               simply spoke the phrase, my
               phrase...

     Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some
     explanation of the miraculous.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               ...as if she had read my mind.
               In that moment, we both knew we
               would always be together. For
               those first years, we were
               incredibly happy, terrifyingly
               happy.

     His old eyes are wet.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               And now this.

     Tolstoy reaches into his boot, extracts his SECRET DIARY.
     He takes a pen from his shirt, begins to write. Valentin is
     amazed. HE HAD A PEN ALL THE TIME.

     Valentin exhausted, sits at the long table.   Chertkov
     appears at his office door.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               Thank you again, Valentin

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               You know I had thought for a time
               to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich
               look for someone else. But...he
               said no. He said "He reminds me
               of myself when I was young."

     He goes. After a moment, Valentin gets up and goes to the
     study door.

<b>                         VALENTIN

<b>                         CHERTKOV

<b>                         VALENTIN

</b>               She is leading you around the
               nose.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               Look, you say the movement's
               about love-

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               Yes... The love he tells us to
               practice, the love of the
               Gospels. Why do I have to explain
               this? Perfect love. Eternal love.
               The love that binds mankind
               together.

<b>                         VALENTIN
</b>               But I've never met mankind, only
               men and women, imperfect men,
               imperfect women.

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us
               love can not be weakminded.
               Go. You won't be missed ...a
               naive sentimentalist

     Valentin looks at him for a long moment, then bursts out
     laughing, walks away

<b>                         CHERTKOV
</b>               Why are you laughing? You think
               I'm ridiculous.

<b>                         VALENTIN

     Tolstoy has fallen asleep at his desk, his SECRET DIARY
     open before him. Sofya enters without knocking. He bolts up
     groggily, tries to hide the little book. Sofya, meanwhile,
     holds up the letter in her hand.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                Lyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to
                purchase the rights to your work
                after your death.

<b>                          TOLSTOY
</b>                Then I shall try and die as soon
                as is convenient.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                Don't be silly. They've offered
                one million rubles.

     Silence.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                How can you not be pleased?

<b>                          TOLSTOY
</b>                I don't write for publishers. I
                write for people.

     He gets up from his desk.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                Where are you going?

<b>                          TOLSTOY
</b>                Valentin's in the library.    He's
                asked to speak to me.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                Splendid...while your wretched
                family is left to starve.

<b>                          TOLSTOY
</b>                I don't see anyone starving in
                this house. On the contrary, our
                privilege revolts me.

     He goes.   She calls after him.

<b>                          SOFYA
</b>                But you're always first to the
                trough...always have been.

     Sofya sinks into his chair. On the desk is the photograph
     of herself and Tolstoy that we saw her hang on the wall in
     the early part of the film. She looks at the wall. There
     in it's place is the offending photograph of CHERTKOV that
     she had removed earlier.

     She can fix that. But as she picks up the photo of her and
     her husband, she notices A SMALL VOLUME, THE SECRET DIARY,
     lying under it. She begins to read.

     Sofya throws the gun at her husband. She runs out of the
     room. We see the shattered photograph of Chertkov.

     After a moment, Tolstoy into his chair.   Valentin watches
     him in silence.

<b>                         VALENTIN

     No one responds. Dushan comes to Tolstoy, sits down and
     begins the ritual taking of the pulse. Meanwhile, Sasha
     wraps a heavy fur coat around his shoulders. She smiles at
     him.

     the back.



<b>                         SASHA

     Dushan climbs into the carriage. Tolstoy turns abruptly and
     walks back toward the house.

<b>                          SASHA

     They watch as Tolstoy kneels on the wet grass, bending low
     to rub his hands against the earth. After a moment,
     Valentin goes to him, kneels next to him.

<b>                         VALENTIN

</b>               When I was a boy, my brother
               Nikolai once brought me to a

               me he'd found a green stick with
               some words on it... the secret to
               happiness for all men everywhere.
               He hid it in the ground. I looked
               for it very often. I've looked
               for it all these years. I really
               believed I would find it

     Tolstoy looks at him.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               I never did...but this life is
               behind me now.

     He kisses the ground of his beloved home, gets up and they
     walk back to the droshky.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Help me up, will you?

     As they go, he hands Valentin an envelope.

<b>                         TOLSTOY
</b>               Give this to Sofya.

<b>                         VALENTIN

     over and over.

     slowly away from the old house.

     There is a pause. Sofya suddenly smiles, becomes
     solicitous.

<b>                         SOFY
</b>               Darling Sasha, where is your

     It is a letter. She grabs it, as if it is something that
     might feed a terrible hunger at the center of her. Moving
     into a corner, she tears it open and begins to read.

     They both watch Sofya's passion. Her face quivers, the
     muscles in her neck stand out. Her shoulders begin to
     shake.

     Crumbling the paper in her hand, she twists her head and
     screams. Then, gathering up her dress, she runs out the
     door.

     Sasha move immediately to the window. From her P.O.V., we
     see Sofya streaking across the lawn.

     They look at each other

     Sofya sprints away from the house and into the trees. A
     couple of servants join the chase, Ivan and VANYA, a fat
     manservant. Valentin, head of the group, sees Sofya move
     out of the birches. She's heading straight to the pond.

      Sofya has reached the bathhouse. Peasant women watch her as
      they do their wash. She glances back her pursuers, races
      on.

      Tiring now, she goes to her knees. She crawls along the
      jetty toward the water. At the edge of the jetty, she
      falls on her back then turns over, most ungracefully, and
      rolls off sideways into the pond.



      HIGH ANGLE. Sofya sinks into the black water. The sound of
      her rescuers fades away and is replaced by Tolstoy's voice,
      reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand.

<b>                          TOLSTOY (V.O.)
</b>                My position in the house has

                doing now is what people have
                commonly done - leave their
                worldly life behind to spend
                their last days in peace and
                solitude.

      water.

                as I forgive you with all my soul
                for everything you've done to me.

      The silence is suddenly ripped apart by the rescuers. Sasha
      and Valentin jumping into the pond. Sasha, barely able to
      swim herself, thrashes in the water.

<b>                          VALENTIN
</b>                Sasha, go back to the jetty.

With that, he pushes away from the dock and makes a sharp
plunge under the water.

Sasha watches, waits...and after a long moment Valentin
surfaces pulling Sofya with him.

On the dock, the servants and Sasha help him to get her
heavy body , water soaked dress, back onto the bank.

She looks terrible. Her tongue lolling out, water drizzling
from her open mouth. Sasha is overcome.

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          She's dead. My mother. She's
          dead.

Ivan takes action. He rolls her on to her stomach, works to
expel water from her lungs. This goes on for an agonizing
length of time. Valentin looks to the sky... dull and gray.

Then a sound, coughing sputtering. She is alive. Sasha,
Valentin, and the servants help up.

<b>                    SASHA

</b>                I'm glad she can sleep. The pain
                subsides a little.

</b>                Come in.

<b>                          IVAN
</b>                A message, miss.

<b>                           SASHA
</b>                For me?

<b>                          IVAN
</b>                No, for your father. From the
                Countess, miss.

<b>                          SASHA
</b>                She's allowed to send a note to
                my father. I just don't know
                where to tell her to send it.

<b>                           IVAN
</b>                She's addressed it to train
                number 9. That's the train the
                master took. The station master
                told me...

<b>                          SASHA
</b>                Why are you giving it to me? She
                is allowed to send my father a
                note!

      Ivan steps forward and hands her the note to inspect. Sasha
      can't help but laugh.

<b>                          SASHA
</b>                She never gives up.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>                Obvious.

      She pockets the note. Ivan continues to stand there. Sasha
      looks at him.

<b>                             SASHA
</b>                Yes?

</b>                He gave me this as well...the

      Sasha opens it, reads. She looks up, flushed with
      excitement.

       Sofya touches his shoulder with real affection, then walks
      across the room to her husband's desk.

       Sofya picks up a photograph of the two of them, examines
       it.

This stops Sofya for a moment. She looks to Valentin.

Valentin nods.   She tries another tack.

      Sofya takes his arm, starts back across the platform.
      Shaken, she tries her best to maintain her dignity as she
      walks through the crowd. She leans against Valentin,
      whispers.

</b>                What? Promised you what? You´ve

      They see Sasha looking from the door.   She turns and closes
      it.

      glow like lanterns in the field.

      Some people lie on the hard platform. He looks across the
      tracks at Sofya's private car. A single light burns in the
      window

      Sofya keeps her solitary vigil. The priest has fallen
      asleep sitting up. She finishes her prayers, gets up,
      looks across at the lonely cottage. She can make out
      Valentin's figure on the platform.

      Valentin sees Chertkov standing near the bed. Dushan
      returns to the chair next to Tolstoy. His cheeks are damp,
      his breathing irregular.

<b>                          SASHA
</b>                It can't be right.    His fever is

</b>                His pulse, you see...

      Dushan begins to cry. Suddenly, Tolstoy becomes lucid.

</b>                Sofya...my dear Sofya. So much

</b>                Shall I call her?

      He seems to smile.

      Sasha looks at him, shakes her head.

      Sofya opens it. It is Sasha. A pause.

      Sasha takes her mother's hand.

      She steps into the room. For a moment, she seems
      overwhelmed at the sight of him. She looks at Valentin, who
      nods at her as if to say go on. Sofya walks past Chertkov
      without acknowledging him. Dushan lets go his hold of
      Tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way.
      She approaches her sleeping, husband, the love of her life,
      her cross, her everything.

There is no response.    She throws her arms around him.

Sasha takes her hand, whispers.

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          Control yourself.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          Was I shouting?

<b>                    SASHA
</b>          You have to control yourself.

Sofya looks around and sits back. Strangely, she does
control herself. She becomes very still. She takes her
husband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          You don't speak, but I hear you.

She carries on two sides of an impossible conversation.

She sits very still holding her husband's hand. Then, it
seems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest
squeeze of her hand. She looks down to see Tolstoy open his
eyes. He looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile,
then closes his eyes again.

Valentin sees it, glances at Sasha.   Then, he begins to
fight for breath.

<b>                    DUSHAN
</b>          First cessation.

A general sense of panic at the proximity of death. Tolstoy
fights for a last breath.

<b>                    DUSHAN
</b>          Second cessation.

Sofya whispers quietly to her dying husband.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          Please forgive me if I cry a
          little now.

Tolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence.

Sasha starts to sob. Sofya reaches out to her daughter.
Sasha comes to her mother who holds her.

She feels someone next to her.   She looks up. It's
Chertkov.

<b>                    CHERTKOV
</b>          I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna.

The most unlikely thing, she pats his hand.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          It's alright. What happens from
          now on... it will never really
          matter. Not really. Everything's
          finished.

Chertkov sits beside them. She turns to Dushan.

<b>                    SOFYA
</b>          Dushan, could you tell them your
          great friend is gone?

<b>                    DUSHAN
</b>          Yes.

He nods, walk out into the dawn light to tell the world Leo
Tolstoy is dead.

      A sizeable crowd has assembled, the usual reporters,
      photographers, cinematographers, but students, too, and
      soldiers, factory workers, housewives.

      Dushan faces the crowd. Quiet. Quiet.

                Tolstoy is dead.

      As Dushan finishes his tribute, a single voice begins to
      sing the old Russian hymn, Eternal Memory. Gradually, more
      and more of the crowd picks it up. Valentin begins to sing.
      His eyes run over the crowd of mourners. Then, something
      stops the flow of his gaze. His eyes fill with tears.

<b>                           VALENTIN

      Masha. She walks slowly toward him out of the crowd. He
      goes to her, takes her in a long embrace.

<b>                          VALENTIN
</b>                Masha...Masha...I'm so sorry he's

      The song, the voices swell around them.   They hold each
      other like they will never let go.

      A black draped funeral train waits in the station. Many
      mourners are congregated on the platform. Chertkov comes
      out of the little house, followed by Andrey, Valentin and
      Dushan carrying Tolstoy's coffin to the train.

      Sofya appears with Sasha, who escorts her through the

      the rail, mourn her loss. As she looks away, we see the
      people reflected in the glass, some of them kneel, some of
      them remove their hats.

      Valentin watches the train pull away. He holds Masha to
      him.

      As the train   moves slowly through the corridor of mourners,
      some of them   fall in and walk behind it. The camera travels
      up and up as   the train travels north taking Sofya and her
