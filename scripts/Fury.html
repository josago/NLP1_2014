<b>          OVER A BLACK SCREEN:
</b>                         
          April 1945 -- The Allied Armies strike at the heart of
          Germany. In four weeks the Third Reich will be no more...
                         
<b>          EXT. FARMER'S FIELD - PREDAWN
</b>                         
          Thick morning fog blankets all. A faint glow in the East.
          It's quiet save for the DISTANT RUMBLE of artillery.
                         
          Super title: Somewhere in Nazi Germany...
                         
          A Spanish Arabian STALLION emerges from the fog. A wasp
          waisted German Army LIEUTENANT erect in its saddle. His
          disciplined horse elegantly picks its way over the furrowed
          soil. A dark hulk looms in the mist -- Horse and rider
          approach...
                         
          IT'S A BURNED OUT TANK -- An American Sherman. Still
          smoldering. Steel armor ripped open like tin foil.
                         
          The Lieutenant moves on. Encounters another charred tank.
          Its entire turret blown off. A small fire still burns inside.
          Around it are the blackened twisted shapes of burnt shrunken
          men.
                         
          He moves on. Another hulk emerges from the most -- This tank
          looks like a scrap heap -- Sandbags, railroad ties, sloppy
          steel plate, cases of wine, rations and ammunition.
          Battered, scarred and seemingly abandoned.
                         
          The Lieutenant guides his horse in a slow circle around the
          armored vehicle. He HEARS a faint CLINK -- And draws his
          Luger from its shiny black holster -- THEN:
                         
          An AMERICAN SOLDIER hiding BEHIND THE TURRET leaps on him...
                         
          Tearing the German from his horse. The two men CRASH to the
          ground. The American stabs the Lieutenant in the face --
          THWICK-THWICK-THWICK! Fast, violent, shocking...
                         
          The American then carefully slides the knife blade behind the
          German's eye - Piercing his brainpan with a CRACK. The German
          convulses for a moment. And dies...
                         
          The American retrieves his knife. Wipes it clean on the
          German's uniform and scans the area with burning primal eyes.
                         
          This is DON "WARDADDY" COLLIER. Late twenties he looks middle
          aged. A light beard and hollow cheeks. Years of combat have
          ground him into something hard and sharp.

          With the mechanical clumsiness of exhaustion, Wardaddy cuts
          the mapcase from the German's belt. Then rips the large
          Knight's Cross medal from the dead man's neck.
                         
          Wardaddy stands to his full impressive height in his oil
          blackened overalls. He crosses to the horse. He grabs the
          beautiful animal's bridal and looks at it for a moment...
                         
          Eye to eye. Connection with the animal. With incredible
          gentleness he rubs its muzzle. And kisses it...
                         
          Then he pulls his knife -- The horse jerks back, but Wardaddy
          holds it firm. He knows horses...
                         
          THWICK! - He cuts off the bridle, slips the bit from its
          mouth. He unbuckles the saddle and drops it to the soil.
          Wardaddy looking at the horse. Then it heads back the way it
          came - Now without ride and tack...
                         
          Wardaddy climbs aboard his tank -- Her name is "FURY" -- It's
          painted on her cannon.
                         
<b>          INT. FURY - PREDAWN
</b>                         
          Dark. Cramped. Crowded. A filthy machine with filthy men.
          There's two main areas - THE TURRET BASKET -- A big
          cylindrical cage that spins with the turret.
                         
          And the BOW -- The front of the tank where the driver and a
          machine gunner sit. The sound of piss hitting tin...
                         
          BOYD "BIBLE" SWAN is draped casually across the cannon
          breech. A pastor's kid from Des Moines, he's serious, calm,
          centered. You'd never guess he's killed a thousand men. He
          finishes urinating into an ammo can.
                         
          TRINI "GORDO" GARCIA sits in the driver's seat sipping wine
          from a bottle. A Mexican butcher from Chicago. He's been
          drunk since 1942. He once went into combat sober - And vowed
          never to do it again.
                         
          Next to Gordo, the transmission housing between them, is the
          body of RED. A blood soaked jacket pulled over his head. His
          blood spattered inside the tank.
                         
          GRADY "COON-ASS" TRAVIS, a good-old-boy from Arkansas, is
          wedged into the battery compartment fixing a short. He's
          cunning, viscous and World wise.
                         
          Wardaddy drops down into the Commander's hatch.
                         
<b>                          COON-ASS

          Gordo offers Red a drink, pushes the bottle into his
          shoulder. Whispers to him...
                         
<b>                          BIBLE

           fool.
                         
          Gordo shoots them a dirty look. Keeps whispering to his dead
          friend. Wardaddy watches Coon-Ass work.
                         
<b>                          WARDADDY (CONT'D)

           it. More where he came from.
                         
          Wardaddy tosses Bible the Knight's Cross - Bible hangs it in
          the turret - Where more German combat decorations hang like
          Christmas ornaments.

          He tosses Gordo the dead Officer's Luger. He inspects it.
                         
<b>                          GORDO
</b>           For this? Yeah. A case or two.
                         
          Wardaddy lights a cigarette. Then scratches another notch in
          his knife with his GI can opener. It's tense - They are
          behind German lines and acutely aware of the danger they're
          in. But danger becomes routine. After years of it...
                         
          Coon-Ass smirks - KNOWING he'll get a rise...

           love shooting horses so much.
                         
          Wardaddy darkens with outrage -- He works his way over to
          Coon-Ass and begins kicking the Hell out of him.

          Wardaddy and Norman head down the street. Two GIs pass them
          clutching wine bottles - both wear top hats and sunglasses.

          CRASH! - SOLDIERS searching a building heave a dumpster out
          the window. It bursts open on the cobblestone street.
                         
          Wardaddy SEES a face in the window on the upper floor of a
          nearby apartment building. He quickly heads for =it.

          Wardaddy grabs Norman's greasegun - cocks it and hands it
          back. He takes the safety off his assault rifle and boots the
          front door.

          Norman follows. They reach an apartment door on the top
          story. Wardaddy POUNDS it with the stock of his assault
          rifle. A WOMAN opens the door - Her name is IRMA - The fear
          on her face is plain as day.

          It has surprisingly modern furniture and decor. Wardaddy
          quickly searches the place. Norman follows him around like a
          puppy. Wardaddy checks closets. Cupboards. Anywhere a human
          being can hide. He enters a bedroom and looks under the bed -
          SOMEONE is hiding underneath.

          bed. This is EMMA - she's 18 - Norman's age. Wardaddy helps
          her up. Norman is transfixed by her.
                         
          Wardaddy drags Emma from the bedroom by her wrist. Wardaddy

          The girl nods: yes. Wardaddy reaches in his musette bag. Digs
          out a soap dish. He opens it and carefully unwraps four eggs -
          Precious rare eggs.
                         
          Then he takes out a can of coffee. And a can of bacon. He
          offers the rare treasures to Emma. Her eyes light up and she
          joyfully accepts them. As a bonus Wardaddy gives her two
          packs of smokes. She happily joins Irma in the kitchen.
                         
          Norman relaxes. Wardaddy isn't here to rape and kill them.
          Norman takes off his helmet. And takes off his jacket.

          The first in years.
                         
          Norman is asleep on the couch. Wardaddy stands before a pot
          of steaming hot water. He has peeled off his jacket, overalls
          and shirt - Hideous burn scars cover his back.
                         
          Emma crosses to Norman and gently wakes him, offers him a
          steaming cup of coffee. Norman smiles at her. He likes her.
          She smiles back. She likes him. She sits next to him. Thigh
          to thigh.

          his decision. He leads Emma into the bedroom. She shuts the
          door behind them.

          Next Norman SEES Emma is crushed and mixed into the rubble.
          She's gasping for her last breath...
                         
          Norman shakes off the blow and starts to dig out Emma,
          desperate, frantic - Coon-Ass grabs him and drags him away.

          Norman carefully climbs out of his hatch. And picks his way
          across the moving tank. Wardaddy pats the big .50 Cal machine

          Wardaddy aiming his .50 Cal at the nearby buildings. Coon-Ass
          exits the turret. Examines the broken track and the smoking
          crater the mine made.

          Norman exits his hatch - He's afraid to jump down to the
          road...

           covering you. Go on.
                         
          Norman looks at Coon-Ass, who shrugs. They approach the Old
          House just up the road...

          Both men freeze...
                         
          WHAT THEY SEE - The Interior of the house is filled with
          mines. Big round anti-tank mines to be exact. Stacks of them.
          It's being used as a munitions depot.

          This place is disturbing in a different way. There is dried
          blood everywhere. Bandages. Medical supplies. Cut off bloody
          uniforms and boots. Amputated limbs. Flesh. Organs. And a
          half-dozen DEAD GERMAN SOLDIERS who succumbed to battle

          Coon-Ass and Norman return to the Fury. Gordo uses a track
          breaking tool to remove the damaged track links. Bible probes

          Norman sits in the roadside ditch. He checks his greasegun.
          It's loaded. He sets it in his lap.
                         
          He adds drink powder to his canteen. Shakes it. He opens a
          can of crackers with his little GI can opener. He chews the
          hard crackers and washes them down with his canteen.
                         
          He yawns widely. He's physically and emotionally drained from
          his first day as a US Army tanker.
                         
          After being in a tank he feels so alone and exposed out here.
          He HEARS something. Scared, he raises his ugly black weapon.
                         
          It's just an OWL in the trees. Norman relaxes. He can't keep
          his eyes open. His head falls toward his chest. His heavy
          eyelids close. And he falls asleep.
                         
<b>          EXT. ROAD SENTRY POSITION - NIGHT
</b>                         
          LATER - Norman startles awake. Gasping for breath. Dreaming
          he was shot. He checks himself for holes. And relaxes - It
          was just a dream...
                         
          He berates himself for falling asleep. He gets on his knees.
          To a less comfortable position.
                         
          Then he freezes. And his eyes grow wide.
                         
          WHAT NORMAN SEES - Moving toward him along the dark road is a
          long column of silhouettes.
                         
          GERMAN SOLDIERS - Marching toward him. A lot of them. More
          than he's ever seen. There are several hundred. And there's
          something about the way they move. These aren't shuffling
          demoralized conscripts. These are healthy, well equipped
          combat troops - And they are heading his way...
                         
          Norman thinks for a moment. He has to warn the others...
                         
          He gets low and slowly backs down the ditch...

          Gordo, Coon-Ass, and Bible work on repairing the track.
          Wardaddy sits in the turret, a deadly alert sentry with his
          big machine gun. He can't see the approaching men.
                         
          Here comes Norman at a full run...

          inside and...
                         
          BRDDDT-BRDDDDT! - Make sure all the occupants are dead.

          A YOUNG TROOPER looks beneath the tank with a flashlight.
          Norman, nearly entirely buried, follows the path of the light
          beam with his one exposed eye...
                         
          The light plays across the undercarriage. Norman's HEARTBEAT
          feels excruciating loud. Blood pounding in his ears. AN SS

           Hurry up! Let's move!
                         
          The Young Trooper turns off the lights. He stands and walks
          away. Iron boot heels crunching the road...
                         
          Norman thanks his higher power. He may just survive this
          thing. Then the boots stop. And return...
                         
          Norman tries to be one with the roadbed.

          The Trooper lays down - CLICK - Shines the light directly in
          Norman's face. He's been discovered.
                         
          ON THE YOUNG TROOPER - Now we see his face. He's a kid,
          younger than Norman. A boy in uniform. He looks Norman in the
          eye.
                         
          Norman slowly lifts his hands in surrender. His oil and blood
          soaked fingers emerging from the dirt and dust.
                         
          The Young Trooper smiles weakly - "I won't hurt you." Then
          turns off the light and walks away.
                         
          Norman sags with anxious relief.
                         
          Shrill WHISTLES. SHOUTING as the Sergeants get their squads
          on the march again. Jackboots CRUNCH the road as the SS
          formation continues down the road.

          The SS Troops are marching away in the distance. On a
          pointless and doomed mission against overwhelming Allied
          Armies steamrolling across Germany.
                         
          Now it's quiet. Dead quiet. Norman, buried in his hole,
          finally succumbs to exhaustion. His eyes close. He passes out
          curled in his womb of dirt.

          Distant ROOSTERS CROW. The escape hatch slowly opens. It's
          Norman - He slips inside the Fury. He forces his way past
          Gordo's body. Then covers Gordo with a jacket. He moves to
          Coon-Ass and covers him. Then Bible, he gently crosses his
          arms over his chest.
                         
          There's Wardaddy. Sitting there. The grenades have made a
          mess of him. Norman takes off his jacket and covers him up.
          He pauses. Gently picks up Wardaddy's big calloused hang. He
          looks at his palm. Traces the lines a moment. As if to
          confirm something he already knew. Then he sets it down.
                         
          Norman finds Wardaddy's knife on the floor of the turret
          basket. He picks up the knife and runs his thumb along all
          the notches. Norman HEARS something...
                         
          Movement outside the tank. And VOICES!
                         
          He freezes. Unsure what to do. This kid is traumatized, he's
          in no condition to fight Nazis...
                         
          Alone and scared. Norman sits there trembling, holding
          Wardaddy's knife for protection...

          An American soldier. - One we recognize - The Huge Dirty
          Soldier from Baker Company - He looks at Norman with war
          weary eyes. Wipes his nose on his sleeve and shouts to his
          buddies.

          Norman is pulled out of the hatch and laid onto a stretcher.

          Norman doesn't know what that means. Or really care. It is
          clear from the churning angst in his eyes he will never, ever
          be the same.
