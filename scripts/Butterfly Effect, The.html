               EVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically 
               hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest 
               are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain.

               FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting 
               for him. ALARMS SOUND. GUARDS are heard shouting to each 
               other. Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's 
               desk. He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand.

                         my plan didn't work and I'm already 
                         dead...

               He takes a deep breath.

                         be able to save her.

               Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...

               ANDREA TREBORN, twenty-five, an attractive pregnant woman 
               strapped to a gurney, is rolled down a busy hospital corridor. 
               She is clearly ready to give birth, and as she flails her 
               arms, she knocks another patient's IV bottle into the wall.

               A birthday party for LENNY, 5, a chubby kid with only a few 
               friends. Evan, now 5, is gently prodded by Andrea toward 
               KAYLEIGH, 5, a quiet sweet-looking girl with beautiful hair.

               Evan clumsily shakes her hand and she quickly leans over and 
               kisses his cheek.

               He blushes and runs to hug his mother's leg.

               In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky 
               cocker spaniel puppy.

               Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on 
               the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he 
               watches his mother work.

               Evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16" wrench 
               from the toolbox.

               The carburetor will not set properly. She bangs on it with 
               the wrench.

               Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb 
               back together.

               Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a 
               spotless nurse's uniform underneath.

                         about was your father not being there.

               Evan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea.

               Andrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the 
               engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile.

               Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main 
               doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on 
               the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks 
               her watch.

               Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. 
               As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window.

               Mrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea.

<b>               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               The classroom is filled with screaming, running children. 
               Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately 
               calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a 
               whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid.

               Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, 
               but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, 
               sweet-looking girl.

               Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk.

                         you first.

</b>                         Yesterday I had all the children 
                         draw pictures of what they wanted to 
                         be when they grew up. Most of them 
                         made drawings of what their parents 
                         did, but this...

               Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls 
               out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it.

</b>                         I don't understand... Evan did this?

               The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while 
               standing on a heap of dead bodies. It's extremely 
               sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have 
               been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically 
               correct.

               Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, 
               and struggles to control her concern.

               Andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot 
               even start the car.

<b>               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
</b>
               The children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's 
               Night. Each child has a picture of his or her family made 
               from colored construction paper and macaroni. Evan's picture 
               (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and 
               himself on a green hill. Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each 
               show two kids and a single father. And their 'mother' is 
               stuck to the far end of page.

               Lenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear 
               family. He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused.

                         move away from me?

               Tommy gets upset. He swipes his hand down Lenny's picture 
               and his macaroni "mother" crumbles to the floor. Lenny begins 
               to cry.

</b>                         Fat little baby, crying for mommy.

               Evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to Lenny.

                         You can still see your mom a little.

               Lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of 
               control. His desperate gasps for breath are frightening.

               Evan, scared, looks around for Mrs. Boswell, but cannot find 
               her. He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his 
               own macaroni "mother" apart and places it over Lenny's 
               picture. It's a nuclear family again. Lenny slowly is able 
               to catch his breath.

               Kayleigh helps Lenny glue a new "mother" in place and she 
               smiles gratefully at Evan.

               As Evan smiles back at Kayleigh, Mrs. Boswell calmly enters 
               the room in time to see Evan tacking up his butchered family 
               portrait. She shivers.

               Evan puts down the journal and eats breakfast. He separates

               sees: Evan, in doorway, expressionless and holding a large

               Dr.Redfield leads Evan inside. Andrea begins to follow, but

               Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table. His eyes are 
               fixated on the door on the other side of the room. Finally, 
               a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass.

               JASON, thirty and haggard looking, enters the room. His eyes 
               want to sparkle at seeing his son for the first time. But 
               tranquilizers have dulled the effect.

               Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that 
               hinder Jason's movement. Finally Jason sits.

               He smiles warmly and speaks in over-enunciated tones.

               Evan "comes to" in another unfamiliar place. Rather than 
               seeing his father across a table, he's looking up at a 
               ceiling.

               Blocking his view of the ceiling is Jason, whose face is now 
               monstrous with rage, and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around 
               Evan's throat, choking the life out of him.

                              teeth)
                         I... love... you.

               Suddenly, ORDERLIES tackle Jason from both sides and wedge a 
               baton under his jaw to wrench him away. Andrea frantically 
               struggles to rescue Evan from Jason's clutches.

                         It's the only way to stop it!

               Jason wrestles the baton from under his chin, hits an orderly 
               in the kneecap and comes for Evan with the baton!

               Orderly #2 acts quickly, beating Jason with his baton. As 
               Jason makes another desperate grab for Evan, Orderly #2 is 
               forced to bash him in the skull. Down for the count.

               Andrea hugs Evan, now in shock.

               And ALARM sounds and Andrea tries to cover Evan's eyes, but 
               through her fingers he can see a quick blur of a pool of 
               blood spreading from Jason's head.

               Dressed in black, Andrea and Evan watch Jason's casket being 
               lowered into the ground. Andrea's tears soak through her 
               veil. A few feet back, Kayleigh stands behind Evan.

               Evan watches the coffin descend, disappearing from sight.

               she softly whispers in Evan's ear.

               A rumble of thunder. Evan looks up at the brooding dark

               Gray skies. Andrea drives the children home. Evan stares at 
               the passing tombstones that flutter by like a white picket 
               fence. The flickering strobe effect that intensifies into a 
               white blur is hypnotic.

               Evan, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny are now THIRTEEN. Evan exhales 
               cigarette smoke, taps his ash and finishes sketching a 
               portrait of Kayleigh in his journal.

               Tommy wears a leather jacket and now has traces of peach 
               fuzz on his upper lip.

               Kayleigh's hair is longer now, albeit stringy and unkempt.

               Evan closes his journal and coolly ignites a STRIKE-ANYWHERE 
               MATCH with his thumb and lights Kayleigh's cigarette. Everyone 
               but Lenny smokes in the basement.

               Tommy, now with longer hair, ransacks his father's army locker 
               looking for something.

               Tommy absently chucks an old Playboy toward Lenny. Kayleigh 
               seems uncomfortable by the sight of it.

                         out.

               Evan claps his hands and stands up, Lenny and Kayleigh join 
               him. Finally, Tommy shakes an old army thermos and hears 
               something rattling inside.

                         the army.

               Tommy opens the thermos, tips it over and a blockbuster (1/4 
               stick of dynamite) spills out. Tommy grins mischievously.

               Evan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being 
               followed. Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up and carrying 
               him. Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed. Evan doubles 
               back, grabs Lenny's arm and he and Tommy drag Lenny through 
               the woods as fast as they can.

               Andrea's car screeches to the curb of Lenny's house. Lenny's 
               mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance.

               As Andrea rushes up to the ambulance, Mrs. Kagan gives her 
               an icy glare and slams the ambulance door in Andrea's face. 
               Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop.

               Blood begins to trickle from Evan's nose as a guttural sound 
               is uttered from deep within him. Dr. Redfield bolts upright 
               in his chair and redirects the session.

               lifts Evan's eyelids and sees only the whites of his eyes.

               some desk drawers until he finds smelling salts. He breaks a 
               small capsule under evan's mouth, pinches his bleeding nose 
               closed and lets Evan inhale the vapor through his mouth.

               Evan lurches forward on the couch and falls off. Holding his 
               bloody nose.

               On "mailbox", Tommy suddenly grabs Evan's jacket and SHOVES

               Kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, 
               darker bruise.

                         father. All they do is make you feel 
                         like shit.

               She looks into his eyes.

               She searches his eyes for sincerity. And finds it. They lean 
               into each other for a TENDER KISS. After a moment, a ROAR 
               from nearby.

               They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring 
               at them from across a small crowd. By now, some teens chuckle 
               at Tommy.

                         you doing?

               Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan. His hands in 
               fists. Suddenly a FOOT reaches out and trips Tommy. Tommy 
               falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him.

               Tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan. Hatred oozing.

               Evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what 
               you're thinking.

               Tommy suddenly lunges at the TEEN PUNK who must be at least 
               a foot taller than he is. Tommy lands a flurry of punches 
               before the Teen Punk can even defend himself, frequently 
               taking opportunities to eyeball Evan.

               Evan, Kayleigh and even the punk's FRIENDS look on helplessly 
               when TWO SECURITY GUARDS SEIZE TOMMY. Tommy valiantly 
               struggles against them at first. But the moment he realizes 
               it's hopeless, he allows his body to go slack.

               As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick 
               smile on his face.  Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless.

               REVEAL she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan's up front 
               and Kayleigh sits behind them. Everyone silent.

               Andrea stares through the rearview mirror into Kayleigh's

               Kayleigh flinches at the question. And Andrea catches it. 
               Evan can't help but look back at Kayleigh. Oh my god, she

               Andrea pulls the car over and stops. After a moment, Kayleigh 
               realizes she's at her house. She exits the car in a hurry.

               Andrea stares at Evan, who keeps his eyes facing dead ahead.

               Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house.

               As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh 
               duck in nearby bushes.

               The station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Evan puts 
               on a smile and charges the car, pounding the window.

               Inside the car, Lenny jerks back in horror. Mrs. Kagan looks 
               angry as she rolls the window down.

               Evan and Kayleigh look guilty as the garage door opens up 
               and Mrs. Kagan continues into the garage.

               Evan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods.

                         I never want to go back.

               As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column 
               of smoke billowing in the horizon.

               Evan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke. Lenny nervously 
               follows behind.

               They exit the woods to find:

               Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses 
               with lighter fluid.

               Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog. 
               Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks 
               up a wooden plank and SWINGS! Evan ducks back at the last 
               minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head.

               Tommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's 
               knee cap. BASH! Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the 
               ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett 
               squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid.

               Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart 
               from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped 
               in the tied gunny sack.

               Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from 
               the campfire to the fluid soaked dog.

               As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands

               His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he 
               is now lying face down on the ground.

               Evan regains himself and sits up painfully. His face is badly 
               bruised and he clutches his battered ribs.

               He gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same 
               spot. Tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of Kayleigh 
               weeping. Evan spins to face her.

               Kayleigh, her knees drawn tightly to her chest, is unable to 
               answer through her tears. Evan struggles to rise but he 
               becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground.

               Evan takes a quick glance toward the gunny sack, smouldering 
               then moans and buries his head in his hands.

               Outside the truck, Kayleigh waves to Evan, tears spilling 
               shamelessly down her cheeks. Evan reaches behind his seat 
               and opens a large cardboard box. It is filled with past 
               journals. He finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and 
               writes something.

               When Kayleigh disappears from sight, Andrea looks over to

               Evan's dorm is cluttered "double" whose walls are adorned 
               with head-shop posters of Gothic rock bands.

               By Evan's bed is a bookshelf filled with books on amnesia, 
               memory loss, fugues, hypnotism and other related bands.

               Evan's roommate, THUMPER, 19, is a completely punked out 
               Gothic boy who weighs 300 pounds. He currently hands a black 
               lacy dress to CRICKET, 17, a pierced Goth co-ed. She slips 
               the tattered dress on as Thumper wipes his post-coital self 
               off with a black tee-shirt.

               Evan barges through the door, throwing his pscyh books on 
               the bed and politely looking away from the half-naked girl.

               Evan opens the window and checks out his Psych project: a 
               small maze has several flatworms at one end and a bowl of 
               cornflakes at the other.

               and throws it on Evan's bed.

               A popular watering hole. A dark rustic interior, blasting 
               alternative rock.

               Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their 
               tables.

               Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women. HEIDI, 
               beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up. She sinks the 
               eleven ball off the rail. KRISTEN coolly smokes a cigarette, 
               confident that she and Heidi will hold the table.

               Heidi sinks another ball and looks up at Evan strangely.

               Heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to Evan.

               Evan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner pocket. 
               As he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious Greeks, 
               including HUNTER, SPENCER, and GWEN make fun of Thumper.

                         run it through the maze until he's 
                         memorized it. Then you put a new

                         floor.

               Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the 
               three-ball in the side.

                         the dumb one suddenly knows the maze 
                         inside and out.

               Evan walks past Heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to 
               squeeze by. The hand lingers longer than necessary and Heidi 
               doesn't mind. He sinks another ball.

                         all of the worm's memories.

                         so smart.

               A handful of popcorn hits Thumper's face. They all try to 
               ignore Hunter and Spencer's jeers.

                         it'll help me understand the 
                         complexities of the human brain.

               Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket. Although 
               his hand clenches on the cue. He meekly shuffles away to the 
               opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks.

                         So are you planning on becoming a 
                         doctor or something?

               Thumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan.

                         mind.

               As Heidi digests this, Thumper carefully lines up his shot... 
               The eight ball.

               CRASH!!! The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing 
               into the pitcher of beer on the Greek's table. They're all 
               soaked with beer and debris.

               Just as they begin to rise, Thumper smashes the cue stick on 
               the table, WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing a 
               spear). They sit the fuck down.

               Kristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around Thumper's 
               waist. He smiles coolly, it's nothing.

               Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall 
               on the bed. Evan's shirt is unbuttoned and Heidi strokes his 
               chest. Suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air.

               Heidi hands him a book marked "AGE 13". He flips it open to 
               a random place and takes the beer from her hand.

               Evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading. As he 
               reads, he seems more and more on the verge of passing out.

                         writing about it gives me the shivers.

               Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's 
               reading. He looks over at Heidi, who kisses him.

                         human.

               As Evan reads, the world seems to ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY VIBRATE 
               around him LIKE A TUNING FORK. His voice becomes distant and

               with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy 
               at full speed.

               Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings.

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         What the hell is going on?

               Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and 
               swings the plank, hitting Evan's head. Evan is sent sprawling 
               backwards, his forehead bleeding freely.

               Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots. Evan 
               writhes in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves 
               toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the 
               rope that traps Crockett inside.

<b>                                     LENNY
</b>                         I can't undo the rope!

               Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile.

<b>                                     TOMMY

                         throat in her sleep.

               As if on cue, Lenny does exactly as he's told. His eyes begin 
               to glaze over.

               Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of 
               strength, grabs Tommy's foot and holds on.

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         I got him, Lenny. Help Crockett!

               Lenny remains frozen in place. Tommy yanks his leg back, 
               breaking Evan's grip.

               Evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap.

               Tommy's voice hitches. His eyes water from pent up 
               frustration.

<b>                                     TOMMY

                         You didn't have to fuck with mine.

               Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy 
               pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the 
               campfire to the soaked gunny sack.

<b>               WHOOSH OF FLAMES

               And Evan passes out.

                         So Don Juan, you pass out on all 
                         your dates?

               Evan doesn't even hear her. After getting his bearings, he 
               grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded.

               Evan drives...

<b>               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Evan, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Very 
               little has changed in the past seven years.

<b>               INT. LENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>               ANGLE ON LENNY
</b>
               Now 20, making a model airplane. He's still overweight and 
               looks like his mother dresses him.

<b>               PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
               The room is filled with model airplanes. Hundreds of them.

               A KNOCK on Lenny's bedroom door. Mrs. Kagan, grayer, fatter, 
               opens the door and escorts Evan inside. She glares at Evan 
               while pretending to be cheerful.

<b>                                     MRS. KAGAN
</b>                         I've got a surprise for you, Lenny. 
                         You'll never guess who's here.

               Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw drops.

<b>               ANGLE ON EVAN
</b>
               Looking around, shocked to see:

<b>               PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ROOM.
</b>
               Nothing has changed in the past seven years. 

               The same kids' toys, posters and comic books.

<b>               AS WE PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND TO LENNY
</b>
               We see he's working on the model again, in his own world. 
               The window of opportunity for conversation has closed.

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         Hey, uh, it's me. Evan.

               Silence. Lenny frowns.

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         What's that you're working on? A 
                         model?

               Nothing.

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         Well, you look busy, so maybe I should 
                         make this quick. I'd totally 
                         understand if you didn't want to get 
                         into this right now, but that day at 
                         the junkyard, could you help me 
                         remember what happened? Any details?

               No response. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk.

<b>                                     LENNY
</b>                         I couldn't cut the rope.

                         throat in her sleep.

               Evan, startled, drops the model on the desk. An epiphany.

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         Jesus Christ. It really happened.

               Lenny stares out the window.

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         What if I can get back all my lost 
                         memories with my journals.

               With lightning speed, Lenny jumps from his desk and 
               unexpectedly shoves EVAN IN TO THE WALL. Squadrons of hanging 
               planes crash to the floor. Lenny digs his fingers into Evan's 
               shoulder.

<b>                                     LENNY

                         your last, motherfucker.

               Evan is terrified. Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins 
               working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. 
               Evan is speechless.

               The door bursts open. Mrs. Kagan looks at the smashed model 
               airplanes by Evan's feet. Evan ignores her accusing stare.

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         Well, thanks for seeing me, man. I 
                         shouldn't have waited so long.

               When Lenny doesn't respond, Mrs. Kagan hustles Evan back 
               into the hallway.

<b>               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT
</b>
               Evan pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins 
               pouring over them.

               Nearby, Thumper empties a can of hairspray into his Mohawk.

<b>                                     THUMPER
</b>                         You really think he wanted to kill

</b>                         All I know is that I might be able 
                         to unblock some of my repressed 
                         memories.

               He finds something he's looking for, marks the page with a 
               yellow post-it note marked, BLACKOUT and sets the book in a 
               separate pile.

               As he sets the next journal on the bed, it automatically 
               opens up to a place where the spine was bent. Staring up at 
               him is the message:

<b>               EVAN'S DIARY
</b>
               "I will come back for you."

               Evan looks overcome by guilt.

               Later that evening:

<b>               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT
</b>
               Evan has now organized a pile of five journals. He selects 
               an entry, begins reading and suddenly closes the journal. 
               Fear covers his face. He holds one of his hands up and isn't 
               surprised to see it trembling.

               He opens his journal again and reads out loud.

<b>                                     EVAN

                         The last thing I remember before the 
                         blackout was holding my hands over 
                         Kayleigh's ears...
                              (his voice slowly 
                              fades)
                         I think I was more focused on her 
                         hands on mine than the mailbox across 
                         the street...

               His own words grow reverberant, distant. Furthermore, the 
               walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before.

               Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the 
               mailbox across the street with intense anticipation.

               When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently 
               drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt, 
<b>               SMOLDERING.

               The mailbox... tick-tock, tick-tock... Like a staring contest.

<b>                                     LENNY
</b>                         Maybe it went out. Should someone 
                         check it?

<b>                                     TOMMY
</b>                         Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

               Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls 
               into the driveway.

               MRS. HALPERN, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of 
               the car and walks to the mailbox.

               Across the street, Tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of 
               Lenny's shoulder.

<b>                                     TOMMY

                         your last, motherfucker.

               Tommy's words make Evan flinch. From inside the car, a BABY 
               begins to cry. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car.

               Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in 
               pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the 
               lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing 
               a fresh BURN MARK on his stomach.

<b>                                     MRS. HALPERN

                         a change, don't you honey?

               Mrs. Halpern picks her up and carries her to the house. As 
               the mother unlocks the front door to the house, the kids 
               break into wide smiles of relief. But wait...

               The mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to 
               the mailbox. Now Tommy is the only one left still smiling.

               The baby fumbles with the mailbox's door handle for a moment --

<b>               ANGLE ON KIDS' FACES

<b>               BOOM!!!

               The blast is deafening. Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny watch the

               Evan and Kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run 
               a few steps when they realize that Lenny isn't with them.

               Lenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson 
               road. Evan and Tommy double back and grab him. They try to 
               make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply 
               against the ground. Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin 
               to run with Lenny through the woods.

               Evan comes to. Lurches his body over the bed and vomits.

               Sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room. Looking sick 
               and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the 
               cigarette burn.

               In the next bed, Thumper's head, wrapped in a blanket, pops 
               up from above a NAKED GESELA'S waist.

               Evan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins 
               of the journal.

<b>               INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

               The lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, 
               posters and banners announcing PARENTS' WEEKEND.

               Carefree STUDENTS and their parents carry shopping bags toward 
               the bustling elevators. Evan leans against the side of a pay 
               phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise.

               She's obviously hung up on him. Suddenly, a HAND grabs his

               Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room 
               looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly 
               watches Evan with growing concern.

               Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away.

               Thumper begins scanning the journal entry. A bitter laugh.

                         fucked up than you are now.

               He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins 
               reading it silently.

               His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in 
               defeat.

               Evan, looking haggard and frail, wipes the greasy hair from

               and he hammers his fist on the dashboard.

               Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. He eyes a 
               piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out.

<b>               INT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - CONTINUOUS

               A run-down greasy spoon. Filled with a number of TOWNIES and 
               TRUCKERS. The place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears 
               decorated in grime motif.

               Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of 
               the kitchen with a tray full of food.

               Kayleigh, now twenty, looks pale and sickly thin. She bangs 
               her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to 
               the floor. Her BOSS stares back in aggravation.

                         without you breaking something?

               Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up 
               the order. She is humiliated and Evan leans back against a 
               pay phone so that she can't see him watching her.

               As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a CUSTOMER pinches 
               her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. 
               She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the 
               customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably.

<b>               EXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - NIGHT

               Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she 
               exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, 
               but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her 
               face and she allows herself to be hugged.

               Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches 
               into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes.

                         stopped it.

               Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow.

                         spoken to you in seven years...

               Her face collapses and she turns away.

                         Just wondered why you didn't hand in

               BEEP. Thumper offers Evan a magnified frown of disapproval.

                         She said you came and saw her last

               Thumper coughs accidentally, tips the bong over on Evan's 
               bed. Reacting quickly, he grabs a towel from under the door 
               and wipes off Evan's comforter.

               Evan, dressed in black, gets out of his car at the edge of 
               the cemetery. A small cluster of friends and family gather 
               at the grave. Evan grabs a bouquet of roses and begins walking 
               to the grave. When he suddenly spots Mr. Miller and Tommy.  
               Evan's hands tense up into fists. He becomes weak in the 
               knees and stops walking. After an uncomfortable moment of 
               standing still, he retreats to his car and watches the 
               ceremony from the driver's seat.

               The last of the mourners are filing away. Evan exits his car 
               and walks to the deserted grave. He drops the roses on the 
               casket and turns to make sure nobody is watching.

               Evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper. 
               He unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite:

               "I'll come back for you."

<b>               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT
</b>
               He makes a weighty decision and gets up. He hastily hunts 
               through his journals, looking for a certain book.

               Evan opens his journal marked "Age 7". He plops on his bed 
               and starts writing sideways in the margins.

<b>                                     EVAN (V.O.)

                         is little more than the sum of his 
                         experiences. If that's true, then 
                         I'm not sure I know who I am anymore.

                         I definitely never knew Kayleigh.

               He turns the page and begins reading the journal. As he mouths 
               the entry to himself, the resonance of an older man's voice 
               seems to REVERBERATE throughout the room and the WORLD behind 
               his head FAINTLY VIBRATES.

               Evan slowly nods and begins to strip out of his clothes. Mr. 
               Miller takes a quick peek at him.

               Mr. Miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement. 
               Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the 
               camera. Tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, 
               looking down.

                         two seconds unless you do what I 
                         tell you.

               Tommy sulks and closes the door. Mr. Miller lowers his voice 
               and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh.

                         grown-ups do.

               Kayleigh giggles and covers her mouth with her hand. Evan 
               looks skeptical.

               Kayleigh stops giggling. Evan says nothing.

               Mr. Miller gets behind the lens. The room is dead silent.

               Who silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs 
               and watches with horror.

               Evan's face is flushed with rage. He walks behind Kayleigh 
               and cups his hands tightly around her ears. She can't hear 
               anything now.

                         the next thirty seconds you're going 
                         to open one of two doors. The first 
                         door will forever traumatize your

               The mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a 
               seven-year old. Mr. Miller looks around the room as if he's 
               the butt of some sick joke.

                         betrayed by her own sick pedophile 
                         father. Ultimately, it'll lead to

               Evan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear. Kayleigh stares 
               at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers.

               Kayleigh looks into Evan's eyes for support. Evan nods go 
               on. His confidence brings a boldness to her lips.

               Kayleigh summons her own new courage.

               his slumber. He suddenly grabs his head as if suffering from 
               a pounding migraine.

               Quick cuts and flashes of Evan and Kayleigh growing older -- 
               she seems more carefree now, full of life and less self-

</b>
               At thirteen, Kayleigh spunkily hops off a GREYHOUND BUS and 
               runs into Evan's arms.

               Still thirteen, Evan peddles his bike by his new house, 
               Kayleigh riding on the handlebars.

               More memory flashes of Evan and Kayleigh throughout the teen

               Finally the memory assault is over. Evan groans in pain as 
               blood trickles from his nose.

               An arm reaches over and touches his shoulder.

</b>                         Honey, are you all right?

               Evan whips around to see Kayleigh watching him. Not only is 
               Kayleigh alive, but she's a ravishing beauty. Evan lurches 
               back from the shock of seeing Kayleigh and falls to the floor. 
               She sees Evan's nose bleed and her eyes go wide.

                         Clean up and come back to bed.

               He stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority 
               plaques and pink preppy decor.

               Evan, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him 
               a tissue. He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed 
               and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and 
               brown suede jacket.

               At the sink, Evan washes the blood off his face and looks at 
               his reflection in the mirror. A nearby shower SHUTS OFF.

<b>                                     EVAN

               Evan turns around and sees Gwen, one of the sorority brats 
               from the bar, exit the shower naked.

               Evan blushes and turns back to the mirror through which Gwen 
               dries herself with a towel while staring flirtatiously back 
               at Evan.

                         who threw popcorn at Thumper.

               Evan holds his temple in pain as another memory comes to 
               him.

               She pats his ass and exits the bathroom.

<b>               EXT. COLLEGE - QUAD - DAY - 2002

               Kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches 
               the eye of every guy on campus. She and Evan stroll arm in 
               arm through the quad.

               Somehow, the world seems brighter now. Even the colors seem 
               more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world 
               we've known.

               MANY STUDENTS wave to Evan and call his name. He can't 
               remember all their names but it's kinda cool being the BMOC.

               Evan takes a long look at her and becomes curious.

                         day. Why would that freak me out?

                         Just being weird.

               Kayleigh playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the 
               ass, then smiles as if a ghost must have done it.

               Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away.

               At that moment, Thumper passes Evan in the lobby.

               Evan hears PEOPLE he cannot see calling his name. Somehow, 
               it's more creepy than cool. The Professor makes a loud

               The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their 
               clothes covered in dirt, food and what might be vomit.

               Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon 
               on a metal salad bowl that a poor THETA CHI PLEDGE wears as 
               a hat.

               The wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing Kayleigh 
               and Evan. Kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees:

               The entire roof is decorated with fairy-lights, Chinese 
               lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles. And elegant 
               romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve FORMALLY 
               DRESSED SERVANTS (previously seen pledges) who respectfully 
               stare ahead with the utmost class.

               Two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by. 
               Kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight.

               As she takes a step toward the table -- FLOWER PETALS shower 
               down on her. She looks up to see TWO MORE PLEDGES standing 
               on ladders, delicately tossing pedals.

               Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down.

                         my life with you.

               Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. Her eyes 
               tell him she feels the same way. A magical moment.

               And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it 
               might as well be their first ever --

               Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time.

               Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked 
               at the bottom of the hill. His face collapses.

               Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. 
               The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been 
               mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the 
               roof.

               The most unnerving thing, however, is a SPIKED LEATHER DOG 
               COLLAR hangs off the rearview mirror.

               By now a crowd has gathered. Evan runs up to people.

               Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this. 
               Kayleigh's eyes plead for him to have compassion.

               and Evan instinctively avert their eyes. Suddenly, Kayleigh's 
               ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride.

               Tommy has grown in the last seven years. He has long, greasy

               Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in

               Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, 
               Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face.

               Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free 
               hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, 
               keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray. 
               Kayleigh screams. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly 
               swinging the tire thumper. Evan charges forward in an 
               uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of Tommy's hands 
               and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into Tommy's open

                         He's trying to fucking kill me!

               Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings 
               down OFF CAMERA.

<b>               CRUNCH!
</b>
               Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. 
               Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother. And stops 
               cold when she sees the damage to Tommy.

               Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still 
               terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a 
               crablike fashion.

               SIRENS come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's 
               limp body.

               Collapses to the ground and begins to weep.

               A SECURITY VEHICLE pulls through the ominous metal gates of 
               the large state prison. The vehicle stops and Evan, along 
               with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints.

<b>               INT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY
</b>
               Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters 
               the General Population area of the prison. PRISONERS begin 
               screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of 
               new inmates. Evan tries to keep composed and walks toward 
               his cell. Evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over 
               the second tier, KARL, a huge muscular con with tattoos of 
               swastikas and other Nazi symbols on his arm, blows a kiss at 
               Evan and winks.

<b>               INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY
</b>
               Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus 
               Christ and various Saints. Burning flames on open cans of 
               shoe polish serve as candles to the large shrine.

               There is a stained bare mattress on the top bunk. Sitting on 
               the bottom bunk is CARLOS, 30s, a massive Hispanic convict 
               covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony.

               Carlos stares at Evan disinterestedly as Evan makes up his 
               bed on the top bunk.

               Evan nods glumly.

               A BUZZER SOUNDS. Carlos leaves the cell without another word.

<b>               INT. PRISON CAFETERIA - EVENING
</b>
               Evan sets his tray down at a table filled with Carlos and 
               some other INMATES. No sooner has he sat down to eat, do 
               eager forks reach onto his tray and steal his food. Carlos 
               shrugs at Evan and offers him a roll.

<b>               INT. MAVIS VISITING CHAMBER - DAY

               Andrea sits across from Evan in the visitor's chamber. Her 
               hair is now bottle-blonde. Four inches of Plexiglas separate 
               the two and they talk on monitored phones. Andrea, frazzled, 
               twirls an unlit cigarette.

               Andrea's look tells him to look for hope elsewhere.

                         focus on your case right now.

               Evan looks as if he's about to disagree with her, but he 
               closes his mouth and placates her.

               And officer signals Evan and points to his watch.

               They look at each other and Evan slowly lowers the phone. He 
               hangs up, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear.

<b>               INT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY

               Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a corridor, clutching 
               his journals. As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches 
               over and firmly grabs Evan's crotch.

               Evan, totally violated, turns white with rage.

<b>                                     KARL

               Evan stands there, stunned, unable to react when --

               Another Neo-Nazi, RICK, swats Evan's journals out of his 
               hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into Evan as he 
               rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at 
               the same time. A minor tug of war.

               Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn 
               pages. Evan sees the damage and goes mental.

<b>                                     EVAN

               Evan swings at Rick and misses. INMATES CHEER! It's on! Rick 
               lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the 
               journals getting trampled. Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED 
               RIFLES echo through the air. The fight stops instantly as 
               Rick and Evan look up to see --

<b>               ANGLE ON
</b>
               OFFICER STATION. Officers aim rifles at the pair. From an 
               upper tier, even more officers with more rifles.

               Their barrels sight directly at Evan. Rick steps away, quick 
               to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals.

<b>                                     KARL

                         sister.

               Evan catches his breath, then looks at the remaining few 
               pages on the floor.

<b>               INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY

               Evan enters the cell with a few entry pages. He looks through 
               them. Nothing there.

               Evan nods depressed, then sees the page from his "Age 7" 
               journal, grabs Carlos' duct tape and tapes the page over his 
               bed.

<b>               INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

               Evan, walking toward some White Supremacists, flinches 
               whenever the occasional INMATE brushes against him. Evan is 
               completely paranoid, waiting for an inevitable attack. Karl 
               makes himself visible among them, holding a journal. He reads:

                         Today I found my grandfather's death 
                         certificate. He died in a nut house, 
                         just like my father. Mom denies it, 
                         but she thinks I'm gonna end up the 
                         same way...

               The other Supremacists start laughing and calling "looney" 
               and "nut job." Evan rushes past them and they make chicken 
               clucks at him.

<b>               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

               Evan and Carlos sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other 
               prisoners working out.

               Evan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him 
               from across the yard. A SKINHEAD PASSES SOMETHING with a 
               white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice.

               Evan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ 
               tattoos all over Carlos' back.

               Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes 
               up a conversation.

               Carlos looks dumbfounded.

               Disappointed, Evan turns back to Carlos. Holds up his journal 
               entry.

               Then as he starts reading it to himself, the bars behind him 
               almost imperceptibly VIBRATE --

               Evan, seven, COMES TO in an old familiar place. WE are back 
               in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class. All of the children 
               draw colorful pictures. Evan sees some paper spindles sitting 
               on Mrs. Boswell's desk. As he heads over to them, Mrs. Boswell 
               firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own 
               desk.

                         and finish your drawing.

               Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. He 
               smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils.

<b>                                     MRS. BOSWELL

                         no limits.

               Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife, stands 
               over a heap of several dead inmates Karl and Rick.

               When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the 
               two paper spindles sit. The metal needles reach up and skewer 
               a number of paper notes and messages.

               Evan looks over to see Mrs. Boswell holding up his drawing, 
               horrified.

               She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven-
               year old strength to WHIP his hands down toward the spindles!

               The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant 
               where SOUNDSCAPES COLLIDE and the world behind him VIBRATES.

               Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence.

               Evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm.

               Carlos simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box 
               of cigarettes.

<b>               INT. KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Evan nervously approaches. A CREW of Aryans block his path.

               The Aryans laugh, make discrete eye contact with Karl, who 
               grins and signals to let Evan pass.

<b>               INT. KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters. 
               They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence.

               They continue to stare.

               Rick stands. All muscle.

                         without 'em.

               Evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees. 
               Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles. Evan looks 
               miserable, about to do the deed when -- CARLOS bulldozes 
               past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall 
               and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch!

               Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around 
               his ankles. Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's 
               face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf.

               Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, 
               as the other WHITE SUPREMACISTS charge the cell.

               Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses 
               his girth against the cell door.

               Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as 
               the other supremacists force the door open -- Evan focuses 
               on the words. Chanting quickly.

                         into Tommy. We hadn't seen the smoke 
                         yet.

               WORDS from the entry begin to SHIMMER. REVERBERANT SOUNDS OF

               storming the cell behind him become a FRENETIC BLUR

               Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods. Evan stumbles 
               at first, then rights himself. He seems strangely exhilarated. 
               A sinister victory smile.

               Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take. 
               Evan shrugs "just kidding" and looks around, getting his 
               bearings. He whips his hand out and stops them.

               He suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an 
               awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine 
               young girl. Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering 
               before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles.  
               Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK PILE.

               Kayleigh and Lenny stare at him, concerned for his sanity.

               Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a 
               razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long. Evan offers 
               it to Lenny.

               Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand.

               Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away.

<b>               EXT. JUNKYARD - LATER

               Evan groans on the ground, writhing. Tommy's voice hitches, 
               eyes watering from pent up frustration.

                         you in juvy for sure. And I know 
                         you'd never leave your sister alone 
                         with your father.

               Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates. A 
               look of understanding passes between them. Gratitude, even.

               Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it. Lenny comes 
               screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell! With all of 
               the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way 
               through Tommy's throat!

               Tommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood. Evan surveys 
               the scene in shock:

</b>                         Oh fuck, Lenny, no!

               Lenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in 
               his hands and freezes up completely. Kayleigh wakes up and 
               SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat.

               Meanwhile, Crockett escapes from the sack.

               Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as

                         But you know, people to see, things 
                         to read...

               Andrea shoots Dr. Redfield an apologetic look. Evan heads 
               out the door, accidentally knocking Dr. Redfield's jacket to 
               the floor. He shrugs apologetically and re-hangs it.

               Outside the office, Evan inspects Dr. Redfield's KEYS and 
               attached SECURITY CARD and smiles. Evan covertly winds himself 
               through the maze of corridors, careful not to be seen by the 
               staff.

               He finally sees a wing marked "CRIMINALLY INSANE". Evan looks 
               around to make certain he's not being watched, then uses the 
               security card to open the door. He looks in every room of 
               the wing until he finds --

               Evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees.

               Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in 
               tight leather restraints. The dark five o'clock shadow and 
               his malicious grin radiate evil.

               His black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous 
               intent.

               Lenny seems neither surprised or happy to see Evan. That is, 
               if he's aware of Evan's presence at all...

               Nothing from Lenny.

                         in here.

               Still nothing. Not even a glance in his direction. Evan sighs 
               and gives up.

               Lenny's eyes seethe with hate.

               Evan backs away, face guilt-stricken.

               Evan enters his dormroom (where everything's backwards),

               Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops

               "Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason and he is

               Seven-year old Evan comes to during the time he first met

               Jason waits patiently for young Evan to finish his sentence.

               Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, 
               and grabs hold of Evan's throat.

               As Jason looks down at us, frothing at the mouth, there's a

               Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he 
               realizes his surroundings. Heartbroken, he shuts the journal 
               and stands up shakily.

               Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work. As

                         okay with you bein' sick and all.

               Evan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and SMASHES it 
               against a wall above Thumper's head.

               Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets 
               and leave. Alone in the room, Evan looks under his bed and 
               breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are 
               intact. He sifts through them again. He finally finds the 
               passage he needs. Something catches the corner of Evan's 
               eyes and he turns to examine it.

               To the left of Thumper's Buddha statuette sits a large VOTIVE 
               CANDLE that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ.

               the street with intense anticipation. Evan suddenly comes to

               Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically

               Tommy, still running, cringes to hear Lenny's stupid 
               confession and rolls his eyes at the situation. Evan positions 
               himself between Mrs. Halpern and the mailbox, frantically

               Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit 
               too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, 
               but no major injuries.

</b>                         What are you geeks looking at? Must

                         huh? Fucking losers.

               The crowd breaks up and leaves.

<b>               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY
</b>
               It's calm now. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair 
               around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms. Random PEOPLE 
               call out to Lenny. He's extremely popular in this world.

</b>                         'Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the 
                         party! Don't even think I'm giving 
                         you my lab notes either! Think I 
                         like getting up for "eight thirty's"?

               Lenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket. Their conversation 
               stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by. 
               Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent.

<b>                                     LENNY
</b>                         Hey, there's Tommy.

               Evan spins around in fear. He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and 
               handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads "Campus 
               Crusade for Christ." Tommy seems good-natured now, working 
               hard and soliciting names for his list. He looks up as Evan 
               rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan.

                         Nagila til I puke.

               Tommy frowns and exchanges glances with Lenny, who shrugs 
               and nods back to him.

               Another exchanged glance. Kayleigh looks at Evan.

</b>                         Let's go for a stroll.

               Evan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others. To 
               the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy.

               Evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can "magically" 
               will to open, close, open, close...

                         kick, huh?

               Kayleigh looks at him curiously.

</b>                         You know how spiritual he's gotten

                         Katie.

                         twisted fuck.

               Kayleigh, now by a bench. Stops and sits. As she casually 
               uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a 
               granola bar and hands it to him.

               His prosthetic hand crushes it. It crumbles to dust. She 
               seems more confused.

               She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar.

                         kids, your keen analytical insight 
                         matched to my generous nature -- 
                         kids grow old as do we, relatively 
                         stable relationships, matching burial 
                         plots, the whole bit. It took a lot 
                         longer to spit out than to imagine.

                         your friend. And there it ends.

               She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically. 
               Tears streak down Evan's face as he speaks in a pleading 
               tone.

                         love anyone as much as I love you?

               Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan 
               turns to see Lenny waving her over. She puts her hand on 
               Evan's shoulder, stands and goes to Lenny.

               Evan can't take his eyes off her.

               Lenny kissing Kayleigh. In painful slo-mo. Evan turns away, 
               utterly heartbroken.

               Evan's stump turns on a BATHTUB FAUCET.

               Evan, fully clothed, lies in a bathtub that's filling with 
               water. Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over.

               The water rises past his mouth, to his nostrils -- Evan makes 
               his peace and takes a final breath.

               And the water spills over the side of the tub. All Evan can 
               do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose.

               A beat. Then the door opens.

               TOMMY ENTERS. Immediately sizing up the situation.

                         edge.

               Tommy casually turns off the water, then pops open the DRAIN. 
               The water level lowers to Evan's mouth.

                         matters now.

               Tommy feels Evan's anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor 
               by the tub. He lays his head onto Evan's shoulder.

               Evan bristles at first, but finally gives in to his hatred, 
               ultimately resting his own head against Tommy's. Taking the 
               comfort offered.

               Evan is startled to see Andrea hooked up to several IV's, an

               to a tracheotomy tube.

               Tommy smiles and kisses Andrea on the cheek. She tousles his 
               hair in return.

               Evan can hardly speak. As Tommy begins to wheel Evan's chair 
               closer to Andrea's bedside, Andrea utters a faint whisper.

               Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk 
               on the floor. Old report cards, books, toys and photo albums 
               fall on the floor.

               years old. He coughs up Lucky Charms that have "magically" 
               appeared in his mouth. On a journal before him is the recently

               He rummages through the utensil drawer and pulls out a large 
               butcher knife and grabs it. He tucks it into his sock but it 
               won't fit. He's still debating what to do when:

               ANDREA WALKS IN and is startled by the unexpected sight of 
               Evan holding a huge knife.

               Evan sees her but remains expressionless. Andrea's face

               Evan, seven again, stands in the basement dressed in his 
               Robin Hood costume as Mr. Miller prepares for the sex scene.

                         they have to kiss and stuff like 
                         grown-ups do.

               Kayleigh giggles. There seems to be a new glint of 
               intelligence in Evan's eyes as he adjusts to his new 
               surroundings.

               Mr. Miller is puzzled, but watches Evan SKIP to the fireplace.

               Mr. Miller puts his eye back to the viewfinder as Evan quickly 
               finds Mr. Miller's old army thermos in the bottom drawer of 
               the dresser, opens it and shakes out the blockbuster.

               He tries to crack it with his own hands, but his seven-year 
               old body is too weak.

</b>                         Hey kid, don't bother with the belt.

               Mr. Miller finally turns around and sees Evan banging the 
               blockbuster on the table. Shock registers in Mr. Miller's 
               eyes and he takes a step towards Evan.

               Mr. Miller freezes on that, and Evan smiles at him.

                         make an impression with you...

               Mr. Miller takes a slow, non-threatening step toward Evan.

<b>                                     MR. MILLER

               Kayleigh's mouth hangs open with utter amazement at the scene. 
               Tommy, hiding at the top of the stairs, slowly creeps down 
               to get a better view.

               Evan rummages in the bureau and finds the wooden "strike 
               anywhere" matches used at thirteen to light his cigarettes.

               Evan, standing near the fireplace, defiantly strikes the 
               match with this thumb and lowers the flame to the short fuse.

               Mr. Miller charges Evan just as the fuse is lit! Mr. Miller 
               knocks the blockbuster from Evan's hand and it rolls towards 
               the other side of the room, resting peacefully against the 
               video camera.

               Kayleigh's eyes are dazzled by the sparkling fuse and she 
               bends down to pick it up --

               writing in shorthand.

                         dead.

               Again, the world flutters as if it were attached to a paint-
               shaker. He takes a deep breath.

                         able to save her.

               Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...

               The cardboard box is overturned. Evan finishes threading a 
               SUPER-8 film projector and turns it on. Careful not to let 
               any light spill against the wall, Evan projects it at the 
               underside of the desk.

               We see familiar home movie footage from his childhood: Lenny, 
               5, has a birthday party. Kayleigh is there.

<b>               EXT. LENNY'S BACKYARD - DAY - 1987

               Evan, 5, comes to at a birthday party. He's unexpectedly 
               gently prodded forward by Andrea.

<b>                                     ANDREA
</b>                         Go on, Evan. Introduce yourself.

               Evan slowly approaches Kayleigh, only five. She smiles 
               bashfully at him. An old memory comes back to him.

<b>                                     KAYLEIGH (V.O.)
</b>                         When my folks split, they gave me 
                         and Tommy a choice who we wanted to 
                         live with. I couldn't stand my dad, 
                         but I knew if I lived with my mom, 
                         I'd never see you again...

               Evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of 
               this distant memory.

               He even inhales the aroma of the place. Savoring the moment. 
               He locks eyes with Kayleigh.

</b>                         He's not usually this shy.

               It's time. Evan leans over to Kayleigh as if he's about to 
               kiss her. Then whispers in her ear:

<b>                                     EVAN
</b>                         I hate you. If you ever come near me 
                         again, I'll kill you and your whole 
                         family.

               Kayleigh reacts predictably. Bursting into tears and runs 
               into Kayleigh's mother's arms.

                         happened?!

               Evan ignores them. He can't take his eyes off Kayleigh.

               Evan wakes up with a bloody nose. He grabs a pillow and covers 
               his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him.

               Lenny (looking fit) grabs a towel from atop an award-winning 
               flatworms project and hands it to Evan.

</b>                         You alright? Should I call the doctor?

               Evan groans and shakes his head "no". He rides out the pain 
               like a seasoned pro.

               When it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles 
               feebly.

                         I really do.

               Lenny nods, still concerned.

               Evan opens the door to a concrete room with a large furnace. 
               He and Lenny carry cardboard boxes.

               Evan nods. They silently dump tons of journals into the fire. 
               Evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies, 
               photo albums, old report cards, etc. In they go.

<b>               EXT. CITY STREET - DAY - 2010

               Evan, a suit now, walks down a city street cradling a cell 
               phone to his ear.

</b>                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, Ma. I'm running a little late 
                         for lunch. One of my patients had a 
                         breakdown. Anyway, order some soup 
                         in the meantime. See ya soon.

               As he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit 
               approaches from the other direction. Evan has to look closely, 
               but it's Kayleigh. A mature woman, now.

               He stumbles slightly, caught off guard. As she passes, her 
               eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's 
               no recognition. Evan watches her continue past him and down 
               the sidewalk.

               After a hesitant beat, he takes a breath, turns around and 
               follows her.
