</b>

<b>     FADE IN:
</b>

<b>A1   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE            A1
</b>
     A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an
     endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy."
     They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they
     pompously begin their umpteenth verse,
     THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past
     the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows,
     weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter.

<b>     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF
</b>
     where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY,
     PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler,
     gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH
     over the edge.

<b>     AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE

<b>     C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK --
</b>
     The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY
     HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour.
     In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a
     MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet
     and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage.
     One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward
     seven o'clock.



     IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a
     MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and
     down.
     Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop
     where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine.
     The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL
     LURCH appears and begins sweeping.
     Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the
     full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back
     of the clock.
     Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall.

     He runs past a couple of doors, past a pair of LEGS in
     pajamas, feet in bedroom slippers. He skids to a halt
     and BACK TRACKS to the legs. He pulls on the cuff of
     the pajama bottoms. They belong to GOMEZ, who stands
     in the doorway to

     Gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas.
     Even at this early hour, he puffs on his trademark cigar.
     Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair. At the moment,
     he radiates unfathomable woe.

<b>                              GOMEZ
</b>
                Think of it, Thing. He's been gone
                for twenty-five years. For twenty-
                five years we've attempted to
                contact Fester in the great
                beyond...
     The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine
     to Gomez's lost brother, Fester. Gomez drifts in from the
     doorway.
     The room has remained untouched since Fester's
     disappearance as a teenager. The thick coating of dust
     and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth
     - a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports
     trophies, a high school photo with all the other students
     keeping as much distance from Fester as possible.
     As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room:

<b>                              GOMEZ
</b>
                ... And for twenty-five years,
                nothing. Not a whisper, not a
                clue. I'm beginning to think my
                my brother truly is lost.
     Gomez sighs.   Thing TUGS at his cuff, pulling him towards
     the

     old-fashioned door latch and the door swings open INTO

     Gomez approaches the bed.   Asleep on scarlet satin sheets
     is...

                      (gazing at Morticia)
               Look at her -- I would die for her.
               I would kill for her. Either way
               -- what bliss.
     Low-voiced, incisive, and subtle, with Morticia, smiles
     are rare. The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is
     offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair
     is spread like a diabolic halo. A dark Garbo, sultry
     and remote, she's a ruined beauty.
     Morticia OPENS HER EYES.

     Pugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized
     chemistry set.
     The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's
     collected -- "Bridge Out!", "Detour! Excavation Ahead!",
     "Dangerous Undertow!", "Keep Clear! High Voltage!"
     SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked
     in the corner.



     In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING

<b>     FISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA.
</b>
     This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has
     every chance of growing up to be the public monster his
     parents would be proud of.
     He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams.    Grin-
     ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down.
     He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma-
     tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he
     crawls out of his human-size pajamas.

     Solemn and mournful, ten-year-old Wednesday has black
     hair and white skin like her mother. She sits on a stool
     among the stored Addams' family objects, ONE END OF A

<b>     STRING TIED TO HER TOOTH, THE OTHER TIED TO A TRAP DOOR.
</b>
     The trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head
     through. She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in
     the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in.
     Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string.

<b>                             WEDNESDAY
</b>
               Thank you, Grandmama.
     In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic.

               You kids are going to have to kill

     Wednesday opens a cigar box. Inside the box are assorted
     human and animal teeth, fangs and dentures, along with a
     collection of glass eyes. Wednesday drops her tooth in
     the box.

     Gomez takes Morticia in his arms. As she languidly
     drapes herself across his chest, she is caught in a

                  human, a rotting shell...

<b>      THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 12/3/90                          8.
</b>

<b>14    EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE ADDAMS' GROUNDS - SAME TIME          14
</b>
      TULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET,
      approach "GATE," a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of
      its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and
      Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be
      startled by "Gate."
      Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered
      grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent.
      High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap-
      pointed in Tully than he is in himself.
      Margaret passes through Gate first. Then, as Tully passes
      through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the
      end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his coat.

               Let me go!
      Ignoring Tully, Margaret continues stiffly up the walk.

                      (to Gate)
               Gimme that! Stop it! I'm warning
               you! It's not a good day!

      Gomez moves a chess piece. Thing gestures out the window.
      Gomez and Morticia both look out. As they do, Thing
      moves two chess pieces, cheating.

      a black cloak. Granny has grabbed her divining rod.

       Gomez reaches a stately mausoleum at the far end of the

      Gate can't open. He rattles miserably on his hinges --
      locked tight with heavy chains and yellow police tape -
      large "NO TRESPASSING!! COURT ORDER!! ADDAMS FAMILY -

                 You've got about nine hundred and

        Morticia is putting Wednesday to bed.

<b>                               WEDNESDAY
</b>
                 If that man isn't Uncle Fester,
                 then who is he, mother?

<b>                               MORTICIA
</b>
                 I don't know, darling.   I wish
                 I did.

<b>                               WEDNESDAY
</b>
                 Why is that lady doing all this?

<b>                               MORTICIA
</b>
                 It's hard to say. Sometimes people
                 have had terrible childhoods. And
                 sometimes they just haven't found
                 their special place in life. And
                 sometimes they're dogs from hell
                 and must be destroyed.
        Morticia kisses Wednesday and she closes her eyes to go
        to sleep.

        The family sleeps - all but Morticia. She sits up in
        bed beside Gomez. She looks around at her family.
        Wednesday sleeps in the same bed as Granny. Lurch is flat
        out on the floor. Pugsley uses him for a mattress, and
        Thing uses Pugsley. Pugsley snores the inhale part of a
        snore, Lurch groans the exhale part, and Thing punctuates
        by wiggling.
        Morticia stares down at Gomez - for a long beat. She
        strokes his hair lovingly. Full of resolve, she gets
        out of bed.

        Fester is lying in bed, the covers around his chin.
        Abigail sits on the bed beside him, tucking him in.

                 I know why you've been so glum.
                 It's because it's taking us a
                 little longer than we'd hoped to
                 find the gold. Isn't that right?
        Fester turns away, depressed.

                 Of course it is. Well, don't you
                 worry - we're right on the verge.

                        (she kisses him on the
                         forehead, and stands.
                         She goes to the door,
                         and turns)
                 You know, some people might think
                 it's strange, for a mother and son
                 to be so close. I think it's
                 beautiful. Don't you, Gordon?
        Fester mumbles something, under his breath.

       Gomez cuts the engine. The car glides silently through
       Gate -- who opens uncharacteristically without a creak.
       Gomez stops the car and skulks out. Thing skulks after
       him.
       Gomez sees the reflections of the roaring fire through
       the study window.

       As Fester takes the poker and approaches Morticia -
       GOMEZ CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, in a back-flip.
       Thing JUDO-FLIPS in after Gomez.

      Without even looking, Gomez parries Tully's blow from

      Lurch is closing the front door, looking puzzled.
      The family is busily decorating the house for their annual
      Halloween festivities. All the decorations are elegant
      yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the
      chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o-
      lanterns. Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from
      the sconces by the nooses around their necks. There are
      clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with
      cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters
      and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe
      paper, dead branches and spanish moss. Skulls, each
      holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and
      the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans
      against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat.
      A banner on the wall reads "HAPPY HALLOWEEN", and the
      letters drip with blood.
      Gomez hangs upside down from the balcony.   Morticia hands
      him a decoration.

      Everyone starts to move toward the den. There is a KNOCK
      on the door. Everyone turns. Lurch opens the door.
      Standing outside are Margaret and Cousin It. Margaret is
      dressed as a fairy princess, complete with wand. Cousin
      It wears a cowboy hat, a bandanna and a holster. Margaret
      is radiant, obviously very much in love.

      Lurch has set up an easel and canvas; he is painting
      Fester and Pugsley's portrait.
      Gomez and Wednesday are sitting on the floor amid
      newspapers, carving a pumpkin.
      Morticia is knitting. Margaret and Cousin It sit together,
      holding hands. Granny brings people cups of steaming
      punch, from a punch bowl.
