<b>          EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>                         
          A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm,
          rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck
          towing a badly wrecked red Volvo.
                         
          He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows,
          turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic.
                         
          The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight
          into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off
          his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up,
          stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt.
                         
          TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in
          the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and
          continues after the truck.
                         
          TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a
          used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY.

          TJ arrives at the car lot as the TOW TRUCK DRIVER is lowering
          the car onto the drive. TJ dumps his bike, out of breath.

</b>           What are you talking about, kid?
                         
          The driver continues working, unhooking the car from the truck.
                         
<b>                          TJ
</b>           Stop unhooking it. There's been a

          The driver nods in the direction of LARRY TOWERS, who is
          approaching with 17 year-old DUSTIN HOWARD and another man,

          Larry moves away from TJ and approaches the driver.

          Tony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't
          like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the
          wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs
          behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door.

          TJ turns the key and begins winding the window up. Dustin
          reaches in trying to unlock the door.

          The window is rising. Dustin grabs at TJ. TJ keeps winding the
          window. It gets to the top, trapping Dustin's arm.

          Dustin is stuck. Larry, Bill and Tony laugh. Dustin yells at TJ.
          TJ ignores him, staring straight ahead.
                         
          The men laugh some more. Dustin's humiliation sets in.

          Larry goes around to the passenger's side broken window and
          opens the door. He leans in and easily drags TJ out of the car.

          development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide
          streets.
                         
          Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big
          patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He
          passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto
          the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road
          and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto
          the road.
                         
          He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at
          it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock
          lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He
          hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down.
                         
          A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens
          and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy
          black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front
          tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ.

</b>           The fuck you think you're doing!?
                         
          Before TJ can back away Hesher grabs him by the back of his T-
          shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house.

          Hesher drags TJ into the unfinished front room. He slams TJ
          against an uncoated drywall. Hesher pulls a pair of garden
          shears from his back pocket and squeezes TJ's nose between the
          blades.
                         
          TJ is terrified. He squirms.

          Hesher is suddenly startled. His ears prick up like a rabbit. He
          hits the deck dragging TJ down with him. Their faces are close
          together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to
          'shhhh'.
                         
          The SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens.
                         
          TJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a
          duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered
          bass guitar and a sleeping bag.
                         
          A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and
          sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and
          then making his way toward the house.
                         
          Hesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom.

          Hesher snaps into action. With speed and precision he gathers
          his stuff together. He shoves it all his duffel bag.

          Hesher lights the fuse on a stick of homemade dynamite wrapped
          in duct tape and throws it through the broken window. He then
          slips out the back door, leaving TJ face down on the floor
          freaked out and confused.

          BOOM! Dirt sprays against the house and pours in through the
          window. TJ cowers, then hears the guttural roar of a van
          starting up. He hears the van screech away.

          TJ jumps to his feet and looks out the window. A dirty black van
          screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and
          rocks in its wake. The security guard stumbles around, covered
          in dirt and disoriented. He rushes back to his car and gives
          chase. TJ lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the
          front door.

          TJ rides down a path and clocks Dustin Howard, the kid from the
          car lot, who stands talking with friends by his car - a shiny
          2007 YELLOW CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG. They spot each other. TJ
          quickly looks away (oh shit) and b-lines for the bike rack.

</b>           If we consider that dreams serve a
           metaphoric function in narrative
           fiction, as they do in life, what
           metaphoric function would you suggest
           the dreams here are serving?
                         
          TJ sits in the back of the class, by the window.
                         
          A little pebble hits TJ's desk. It bounces onto the floor. TJ
          looks around to find where it came from - and then another one
          hits him in the head.
                         
          He looks out the window. Hesher is right outside the window. He
          takes the cap off of a large BLACK MAGIC MARKER. He holds it up
          to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. He exhales slow and
          long, staring hard at TJ.
                         
          TJ looks around confused. Hesher recaps the marker, throws it
          hard at TJ and wanders off. The marker hits TJ, then falls to
          floor near his feet. He reaches for it. Mrs. Elsberry sees this.

          TJ passes the marker forward. Mrs. Elsberry sets the marker on
          her desk.

          It's after school. Kids are leaving campus. TJ wheels his bike

          We see that someone has drawn - in BIG BLACK MARKER - a crude
          picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis.
          The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so
          his real head lines up with the drawing. It's drawn in
          perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the
          naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK'
          have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car
          toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super
          market parking lot, attempting to get away.
                         
          Dustin accelerates ahead of TJ and screeches to a halt in front
          of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him. TJ stumbles and
          falls off his bike. His bike lands on top of him.
                         
          Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle
          of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself,
          cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to
          wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him.
          He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process.
                         
          And then a WOMAN'S VOICE -
                         
<b>           VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Hey!

          Dustin ignores one last time - a beat passes, then the woman,
          NICOLE (mid-20s), appears behind Dustin and jumps onto his back,
          bear hugging his face.

          Dustin shakes erratically, Nicole has a tight grip on him, but
          eventually Dustin manages to throw her onto the ground.

          around at the scene he's created in the street. A man steps out
          of his car. Dustin realizes it's time to go.

          TJ grabs his T-shirt and pulls it back on. He picks his bike up

          Hesher shuts the drawer. He's holding a fork.

          Hesher strides across the back lawn in his underwear.
                         
          TJ and Dad step out the door and watch him.
                         
          Hesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a
          monkey. At the top, he fiddles around with the fork, banging and
          wrenching at the cable box.
                         
          He drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent. Only a
          couple of feet from the ground, he loses his grip and falls,
          crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole.

          TJ and Dad stand staring frozen.
                         
          Hesher lifts himself up out of the bushes, brushes himself off
          and heads back to the house.

          Hesher sits back down on the couch and begins to flip through
          the newly acquired channels. He finds porn and drops the remote
          down beside him. He sits back and watches girl-on-girl action.
                         
          TJ and Dad stand just inside the TV room, stunned, watching the
          newly acquired porn.
                         
          Then a LOUD BUZZ marking the end of the wash's cycle sounds from
          the laundry room.
                         
          Hesher gets up off the couch and heads for it.

           eighteen hundred dollars, not
           including taxes, registration, ADM, or

           that day I made a cherry cake and I
           used a new product - I didn't know it
           till afterwards- I used Fluffo. They
           never made it again that Fluffo. It
           was an imitation brand. I served the
           cake and there was silence. And then -
                         
          Grandma makes a clicking sound with her tongue on the roof of
          her mouth.

          TJ waits with his bike in the street outside the school. He's
          beat up, wet and dirty. School's out. Most kids have already
          left. Dad pulls up in Grandma's maroon Buick. He gets out and
          opens the back door for TJ's bike.

          TJ and Dad sit on beanbags set out in a circle of about 12.
          Eight of these beanbags have people sitting on them - adults and
          a few kids. Some drink tea and coffee from little styrofoam
          cups. The tone is sombre. Dad and TJ look unsure of themselves.
          The chairperson of the meeting is MERYL, a 42 year-old grief

          Dad and TJ pull into the driveway of the Forney house. Hesher's
          van is parked haphazardly on the lawn. TJ looks at it with venom
          - a reminder of the afternoon.

          He walks through the TV room to the laundry room. He rips open
          the door to the garage and flicks on the light. It's empty
          except for a little pile of Hesher's stuff.
                         
          He walks back through the living room as Dad walks in through
          the front door, closing it behind him.

          curtains and looks out. TJ and Hesher drop to the ground behind

          TJ lifts himself up again to see what's going on. He sits low,
          concealing himself, and watches the altercation in the street.

          (shirtless) and Nicole in the street. Hesher stubs his

          As if he were possessed by the music, Hesher veers dangerously
          off the road onto a dirt patch. He has a crazed look in his
          eyes. TJ and Nicole grab onto anything they can hold onto.
                         
          Hesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas. The van spins in
          circles spraying dirt in every direction. TJ gets thrown from
          the back seat onto the ground. Dirt pours into the windows and

          Then TJ and Hesher come bursting up for air.

          slaps at the water. He tugs her leg again. Pretty soon she's
          laughing. Hesher's head appears above water momentarily.

          He dives again. He pulls her leg. She laughs hard. TJ watches
          feeling a little left out. Hesher jumps up and climbs out of the

          way. They go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing,
          while Hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and
          anything else in reach into the water.
                         
          TJ and Nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs

          There is an awkward silent moment between TJ and Nicole. TJ
          looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the
          side of the pool. He manages to get one to crawl onto the his
          finger.

          Hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to
          the diving board. He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid
          through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool.
                         
          Hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it
          with his lighter. The diving board erupts into flames.

          After a few moments, he comes back and sits on the edge of the
          bed. He is holding a glass BONG. The bong has so much resin

          half and loads the bowl of the pipe.

<b>                          HESHER
</b>           It's a bong. The water filters the
           smoke. It's probably the most healthy
           way to smoke weed.
                         
          Hesher lights up and takes a HUGE hit from the bong. He explains
          his technique to Grandma while holding the smoke in.
                         
<b>                          HESHER (CONT'D)
</b>           OK, so basically cover the hole here
           with your thumb then suck on the top
           and once the chamber fills with smoke,
           take your finger off the hole and suck
           in.
                         
          Hesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper into
          his lungs.
                         
<b>                          HESHER (CONT'D)

</b>           Umm, OK.
                         
          Grandma takes the bong and has a hit. It's a bit clunky, but she
          manages to make it work.
                         
<b>                          HESHER
</b>           Ok, lift your finger.
                         
          Hesher helps her. The smoke shoots into her lungs. Grandma
          begins to cough.
                         
<b>                          GRANDMA

<b>                          HESHER
</b>           Yeah, that was good. Hit it again.
                         
          Grandma has another hit. It goes well. She blows out the smoke.
                         
          Hesher takes the bong off her and has another HUGE one for
          himself. He passes the bong back.

           they're the right shape -
                         
<b>                          HESHER
</b>           Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to
           have a snake and I fed it mice. But
           one time I fed this little fuckin'
           mouse to my snake and that mouse was
           tough. I dropped that mouse in the
           snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go
           near him, and any time he tried that
           mouse would just smack him with his
           little, you know...
                         
          Hesher looks at his hand, not knowing what mouse hands are
          called.

</b>           With his little mouse hand. So instead
           of eating the mouse the snake just
           curled up crying in the corner and the
           mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And
           this went on for weeks, the snake
           wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse
           used to sit in a little miniature lawn
           chair scratching his balls and
           shelling peanuts and this snake was
           just too scared to go near it. And cuz
           the snake was scared of that mouse I
           had to feed him other mice, but every
           time I dropped another mouse in the
           tank, it'd hide behind the brave
           mouse. And so eventually the snake
           starved to death. I had a cage full of
           mice.

          the living area. Clothes are strewn around. He sees Hesher's
          combat boots, T-shirt, jeans. TJ looks seriously troubled.
                         
          We can faintly hear heavy breathing/moaning coming from the
          bedroom.
                         
          TJ walks over to a door. It's an inch ajar. He pushes it open
          gently.
                         
          We don't see what he sees, but TJ stands deathly still, eyes
          wide, white as a ghost. We hear Nicole giggle. Then -

          TJ storms away, heading for the front door. He pulls a lamp
          smashing to the ground on his way out.

          TJ charges down the stairs. He grabs his bike and heads out into
          the street. Light rain falls. We see Hesher appear behind him,
          barefoot and topless, buttoning his jeans.
                         
          TJ notices Hesher's van parked out the front, he drops his bike
          and grabs a rusty pipe from a pile of garbage on the sidewalk
          and heads straight toward the van.

          TJ takes a hard swing into the van, smashing the tail light.
          Nicole runs out into the street, concerned, wearing an oversized

          approaches TJ. TJ takes a swing at him with the pipe.
                         
          Hesher steps back. Nicole gasps, her hand to her mouth. She
          doesn't know what to say or do.

          TJ throws the pipe at Hesher. It hits the road with a loud

          Dad sits at the dining room table with a FUNERAL DIRECTOR - a
          tall, lanky man. He talks in a drawn, soft monotone. Dad doesn't
          appear to be at all in the mood for this conversation.

          amplifier. TJ kicks the guitar, snapping it in two.
                         
          Out of breath, he stands in the mess he has created. Something

          TJ doesn't quite know what to do now. He stares at Dustin who
          looks genuinely frightened. TJ releases the shears and backs
          away. And the second he does so, Dustin leaps off the couch,
          grabs TJ by the throat and slams him down on the living room
          floor. TJ drops the shears.

          stunned, and looks up to see Hesher, dripping wet, step through
          the big nasty hole he has just made.

          Dustin moves to stand. Hesher pounces on him, dragging him along
          the ground. He grabs the shears and brings them straight up to
          Dustin's nose. In the same movement, he snaps the shears shut
          and takes the end of Dustin's nose off.

          TJ rides his bike over a rickety red bridge. He pulls his bike
          up outside the tall wire fence of a big dirty wrecking yard -
          D&S Auto-Wreckers. It's still raining very hard. TJ is soaking
          wet. He sits on his bike, looking at mountains of wrecked cars
          inside.
                         
          TJ hops off his bike and shoves it behind a dumpster. He gets up

          TJ roams the stacks, looking for his mother's car. He looks
          distraught. All around sit stacks of wrecked cars. A vicious dog
          on a chain barks and snarls nearby.
                         
          TJ stops. He sees his mom's car atop a tall stack of wrecks. He
          looks at it a moment, contemplating what to do. He moves to the
          base of the stack and begins to climb.
                         
          He clambers slowly up the pile in the rain. It's awkward and
          difficult and more than a little dangerous.
                         
          Finally he reaches the top. He wrenches open the car door and
          squeezes behind the wheel.

          TJ is hanging dangerously out of the car, swinging his legs and
          screaming at the top of his lungs. His voice can barely be heard
          over the sound of machinery.
                         
          A guy on the ground, MARIO, looks up and spots TJ. He
          frantically looks to get the crane operator's attention.

</b>           Ricky! Kill it, man.
                         
          Ricky sticks his head out of the crane cab, like he can't hear.

          As the car is lowered TJ jumps the last few feet to the ground.
          Mario leads him away from the car and the crane.

          TJ doesn't respond, he backs away.
                         
          Mario watches him walk away, still disbelieving. He turns back
          to Ricky and gives him the all clear to start her up again.
                         
          TJ walks to the entrance gate while behind him his mom's car is
          hoisted high in the air.
                         
          TJ stops at a dirty vending machine by the gate. He pulls coins
          from his pocket and slots them in. It spits out a chocolate bar.
                         
          Moments later TJ stands with his half-eaten chocolate bar while
          watching his Mom's car get fed into a giant crushing machine and
          compacted into scrap. Tears well in his eyes. He feels helpless.

          starts crying, he's falling to bits.

          TJ stands in front of a mirror trying to correctly tie his neck

           ear. We should be fine.
                         
          Dad looks at the funeral director, not quite sure he's hearing
          him right. The funeral director's phone continues to vibrate.

</b>           OK. Excuse me.

          The funeral director stands at the front of the room. He hits
          play on the in-house stereo - generic classical musak. TJ and
          Dad take seats next to each other, but they might as well be a
          hundred miles apart. About ten other people sit.
                         
          The funeral director hits stop. He stands and approaches the
          microphone.

</b>           We are gathered here today to mourn
           the loss and commemorate the life of
           Madeleine Frances Forney.
           (to arriving late comers)
           Ah, if you could please take your
           seats as quickly as possible that'd be
           great. Thank you.
           (he waits a beat)
           Madeleine was a beloved wife, mother,
           grandmother and friend. And now Mrs
           Agnes Rosowski, a dear friend and
           neighbor, will say a few quick words.
                         
          MRS AGNES ROSOWSKI hobbles her way to the microphone.

</b>           I did not know Madeleine long enough,
           but from the moment I moved into the
           neighborhood so many years ago, she
           treated me as though I was part of the
           family.

          While Agnes speaks, TJ and Dad notice the funeral director, off
          to the side, whispering business to two of his employees. He
          makes every attempt to be subtle and discreet about it, but he
          is clearly struggling with today's workload.

          at the microphone and struggles for a long beat, but nothing

          Sound of slow clapping from the back. It's Hesher. His hair
          looks extra greasy, he's wearing a dirty white Budweiser T-shirt
          and he's holding a tall can of beer under his arm which spills
          as he claps. He is VERY drunk.
                         
          The funeral director tries to wrap it up.

          With purpose Hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp and
          down the center aisle of the room, toward the exit. He turns to

</b>           You promised Grandma you'd go on a
           walk with her. This is your last
           chance.
                         
          Hesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the
          coffin toward the exit and out through the doors.
                         
          TJ and Dad watch him, unsure. After a moment, They follow him to
          the door. They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the
          coffin out into the parking lot.
                         
          TJ is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears. He heads
          across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the
          walk. Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does
          the same.
                         
          All three are now walking together through the funeral home
          parking lot with Grandma's coffin. They don't speak. It's a
          release. Other mourners watch from the doorway.

          Hesher wheels Grandma's coffin across the parking lot with TJ
          and Dad beside him. They seem solemn and strangely dignified in
          a dishevelled way.
                         
          Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street.
          Traffic passes around them. Some cars come to a complete stop.
                         
          Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of
          the street and the three continue their silent walk with
          Grandma.
                         
          In slow motion the three walk. Dad puts his arm around TJ's
          shoulders, TJ puts his arm around Dad's.
                         
          And then a cop car cruises beside them slow. The cops inside
          watch them. Dad looks over. One of the cops smiles.

          The cop car pulls up outside the house. The back door opens and
          Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk. Dad climbs
          out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet. A cop speaks
          to them from the open window.

          The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away. TJ and
          Dad help Hesher across the lawn to the front door. We hold on
          the house for a beat.

          Dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard. Golden
          sunlight pours in through the windows.
                         
          A moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream.

          The garage door is open. The garage is flooded with daylight and
          no sign of Hesher.
                         
          TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door. At the
          garage's entrance they stop. Their eyes register something
          seriously unusual outside.
                         
          'Master of Puppets' by Metallica punches in. LOUD.
                         
          A giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the
          center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art. They
          stand and stare at it, almost in awe.
                         
          Then from the across the street, we see the object in the
          driveway and TJ and Dad on the porch looking at it.
                         
          We also see the words 'HESHER WAS HERE!' spray painted on the
          front of the house in big letters, as yet unseen by TJ and Dad.
          Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders.

          Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in TJ's face; Hesher
          pantsing Dad; Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma saluting
          him back.
                         
          Hesher behind the wheel of his van, smoking a cigarette and
          making a direct line for the setting sun.
                         
          A mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human, shelling a
          peanut. He throws the shell over his shoulder watching the
          setting sun.
