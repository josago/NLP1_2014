<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. FOREST - DAWN
</b><b>          
</b>          Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white
          like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.
<b>          
</b>          STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a
          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A
          LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.
<b>          
</b>          A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as
          the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and
          rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.
<b>          
</b>          It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the
          forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces
          across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
<b>          
</b>          A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.
          Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
          his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.
<b>          
</b>          As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:
<b>          
</b><b>          P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
</b><b>          
</b>          About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,
          DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
<b>          
</b><b>          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
</b><b>          
</b>          The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked
          onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
<b>          
</b>          THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More
          cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.
<b>          
</b>          ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
          tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs
          and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers.
<b>          
</b>          THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a
          grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks
          around again, checking its surroundings for predators.
<b>          
</b>          THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering
          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
          familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
<b>          
</b>          THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the
          watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An
          interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
<b>          
</b>          Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,
          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  2.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing
          and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.
<b>          
</b>          THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing
          him to us for the first time.
<b>          
</b>          He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
          with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work
          boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.
<b>          
</b>          Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a
          DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.
<b>          
</b>          Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
          hanging from a frayed twine cord.
<b>          
</b>          His name is ELI.
<b>          
</b>          He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches
          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood
          from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
          falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
          FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.
<b>          
</b>          Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the
          ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the
          writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.
<b>          
</b>          He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.
          He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.
          Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.
<b>          
</b>          For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat
          and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie
          suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.
<b>          
</b>          A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to
          its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old
          SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.
<b>          
</b>          He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on
          his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK
          SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
          asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    3.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both
          directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-
          out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.
<b>          
</b>          The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.
          Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a
          MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.
<b>          
</b>          Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle
          but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually
          wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.
<b>          
</b>          They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.
<b>          
</b>          He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he
          walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
          loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in
          no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.
<b>          
</b>          The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now
          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.
<b>          
</b>          The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no
          color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
          leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.
<b>          
</b>          CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of
          a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
          from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED
          AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.
<b>          
</b>          Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on
          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
          the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.
<b>          
</b>          After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down
          the other fork, away from the city.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli
          walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.
          Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.
<b>          
</b>          He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty
          shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even
          look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.
<b>          
</b>          Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-
          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    4.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>                    ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR
</b><b>          
</b>          He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings
          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
          cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
          floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
<b>          
</b>          Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
          idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
<b>          
</b>          As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
          box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
          hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
<b>          
</b>          He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
          grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
          broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.
<b>          
</b>          Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,
          overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting
          sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
          revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
          unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
<b>          
</b>          Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
          Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
          largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
<b>          
</b><b>          KITCHEN
</b><b>          
</b>          Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
          the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
<b>          
</b>          He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
          ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
<b>          
</b>          Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
          Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
          enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  5.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          BEDROOM
</b><b>          
</b>          A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
          toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
<b>          
</b>          No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
          HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
<b>          
</b>          Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
          pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
          ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
<b>          
</b>          He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
<b>          
</b>          He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
          new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
<b>          
</b><b>          LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
          over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
          watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
          it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
<b>          
</b>          He clasps his hands together in prayer.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Dear Lord, thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us today
                    with this bountiful feast.
<b>          
</b>          He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
          we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
          John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Thank you for the many gifts that
                    you have given me. Thank you for
                    your protection and your guidance.
                    Thank you for bringing me this far.
                    I know my long journey's end is
                    near. I ask now only for the
                    strength and the courage to
                    complete the task that you in your
                    infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
                    upon me over all men. I won't let
                    you down. Amen.
<b>          
</b>          He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
          a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
          relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  6.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Hey. You hungry?
<b>          
</b>          It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
          emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
          offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
<b>          
</b><b>          SUNDOWN
</b><b>          
</b>          The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
          broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
          SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
<b>          
</b>          He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
          OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
          eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
<b>          
</b>          Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
          beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
<b>          
</b>          He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
          sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
<b>          
</b><b>          MANY PAGES LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
          Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
<b>          
</b>          A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
          a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
          reaches into his pocket and produces:
<b>          
</b>          AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
          with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
          cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
<b>          
</b>          The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
          Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
<b>          
</b>          THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
          as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
          the music to another world, a world far from this one.
<b>          
</b><b>          MORNING
</b><b>          
</b>          Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
          exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
<b>          
</b>          The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
          he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
          Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
<b>          
</b>          He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
          All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  7.

<b>          
</b>          The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
          into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
</b><b>          
</b>          The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.
<b>          
</b>          He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on
          his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead
          trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
          world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road
          reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".
<b>          
</b>          Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli
          arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in
          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
<b>          
</b>          The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.
<b>          
</b>          She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
          from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.
<b>          
</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                    Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
                    take anything you want. You want
                    some food? Take it.
<b>          
</b>          She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli
          stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to
          read behind the mirrored goggles.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    I'm not going to hurt you.

</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                    That's what the last guys said.
<b>          
</b>          Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled
          contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Here.

</b><b>                                                                    8.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.
<b>          
</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                    Could you help me? The wheel came
                    off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
                    could get it out of the ditch. But
                    I can't.
<b>          
</b>          Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just
          inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
<b>          
</b>          He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,
          revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,
          showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
<b>          
</b>          He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the
          cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.
<b>          
</b>          Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,
          waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They
          exchange anxious looks.
<b>          
</b>          ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    One good thing about no soap any
                    more. You can smell the road agents
                    a mile off.
<b>          
</b>          The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits
          EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple
          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.
<b>          
</b>          The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
          passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER
</b>                    Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
<b>          
</b>          He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.
<b>          
</b>          Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
          in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.
<b>

</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    I can't do that.
<b>          
</b>          The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within
          striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER
</b>                    Want us to do it for you? We can
                    get it off real easy after we've
                    hacked your fucking arms off.
<b>          
</b>          Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,
          even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    It's real important you boys listen
                    to me and understand. The man I
                    work for, you do not want to cross
                    him. See, I'm under his protection.
                    You stand in my way, you stand in
                    his. And he will cut you down with
                    a righteous fury - through me. For
                    I am his faithful instrument.
<b>          
</b>          BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and
          then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER

                    take off the pack and set it on the

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes
          another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER

                    again and you will not get it back.
<b>          
</b>          The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how
          it's supposed to go.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER
</b>                    All right, I had just about enough
                    of this shit...
<b>          
</b>          He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.
<b>          
</b>          If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn
          his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and
          drips onto the asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's
          shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The
          SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.
<b>          
</b>          Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
          where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER
</b>                    What... you just... he just cut my
                    fucking hand off! My fucking hand!
<b>          
</b>          Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
          the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to
          the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER
</b>                    What you standin' around for? Kiss

</b><b>                              ELI

<b>          
</b>          A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
          ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.
<b>          
</b>          Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But
          it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    11.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
          ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards
          away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.
<b>          
</b><b>                               ELI
</b>                    I told you you wouldn't be getting
                    that back.
<b>          
</b>          Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
          on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a
          moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.
<b>          
</b><b>                              BANDIT LEADER

</b>                    My name is Eli.
<b>          
</b>          And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.
<b>          
</b>          He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.
          She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.
<b>          
</b>          He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the
          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches
          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

<b>          
</b>          She looks at him, puzzled.

</b><b>                              YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                    Why are you doing this?
<b>          
</b>          Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches
          beside them and begins searching their bodies.
<b>          
</b>          He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo
          lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.
<b>          
</b><b>          LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered
          with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.
<b>          
</b>          Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks
          quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                   12.

          transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.

<b>          
</b>          He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the

</b>          The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
<b>          
</b>          Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
<b>          
</b>          TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
<b>          
</b>          The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
<b>          
</b>          Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
<b>          
</b>          FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
<b>          
</b>          The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
<b>          
</b>          The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
<b>          
</b>          The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.
<b>          
</b>          Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for
          his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path. It ain't your concern. Stay
                    on the path.
<b>          
</b>          Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,
          but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and
          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And
          then finally, suddenly, is silenced.
<b>          
</b>          Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
          bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the
          wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into
          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs
          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road
          forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.
<b>          
</b>          The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other
          fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.
<b>          
</b>          A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No
          words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
          FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.
<b>          
</b>          Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his
          pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.
<b>          
</b>          He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like
          structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
          plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.
<b>          
</b>          HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many
          wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.
<b>          
</b>          Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he
          braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,
          entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
<b>          
</b>          It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
<b>          
</b>          It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 15.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.
<b>          
</b>          Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,
          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

                    around here?
<b>          
</b>          The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions
          toward a storefront at the far end of the street.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Thanks.
<b>          
</b>          Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a
          STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely
          fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of
          a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.
<b>          
</b>          As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents
          take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.
<b>          
</b>          Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's
          face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
          PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
          together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.
<b>          
</b>          Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.
          They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry
          picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.
<b>          
</b>          Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like
          cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a
          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHAIN GANG BOSS
</b>                    Come on, move it!
<b>          
</b>          The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't
          return the look, just continues crossing the street as the
          blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a
          pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.

</b><b>          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-
          APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.
          Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
<b>          
</b>          An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
          of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
<b>          
</b>          Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
<b>          
</b>          Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something.
<b>          
</b>          Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.

</b>          Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced
          downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of
          ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
          little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.

</b>          This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn
          out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the
          stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.
<b>          
</b>          Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most
          prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an
          OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
          MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.
<b>          
</b>          The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but
          has no taste whatsoever.
<b>          
</b>          A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
          the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.

</b><b>          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has
          assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF
          CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He
          treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a
          MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his
          words to the far reaches of the crowd.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    I want you all to remember how far
                    we've come together. And how far we
                    still can go, if only we believe.
                    When I brought us here to this
                    oasis - this promised land - we
                    knew there would be hardships. Knew
                    there would be sacrifices. But we
                    also knew that we were creating for
                    ourselves a world where we could be
                    safe from the horrors of the
                    forsaken lands beyond our borders.
<b>          
</b>          The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word.
          He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his
          cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us
          of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    And I want you all to remember
                    above all that it is not the water
                    with which we have been blessed
                    that is the true lifeblood of this
                    town... but faith.
<b>          
</b>          This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many
          don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie
          senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now
          with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    It is our faith that sustains us,

<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 21.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The crowd is divided. Many return the "Hallelujah" with
          varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But
          Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    And mark me, the ultimate
                    validation of that faith is coming!
                    The sacred Word of Our Lord that
                    formed the world before and will
                    reform it once again is coming to
                    this town to bring it succor, bring
                    it nourishment, bring it new life!
                    For the Almighty Himself has spoken
                    unto me and promised it!
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.
<b>          
</b><b>                               CARNEGIE
</b>                    In the meantime, He has asked us
                    all to be patient. To walk the hard
                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer. And to do that, we must
                    give just a little more.
<b>                        (BEAT)
</b>                    Water rations will be halved until
                    further notice.
<b>          
</b>          This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some
          still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    I understand your frustration. The
                    road to salvation is a difficult
                    one - but what lies at the end of
                    that road is a greater glory,
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
<b>          
</b>          A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.
<b>          
</b><b>                              DISCONTENTED VILLAGER
</b>                    We've heard this all before! When
                    are you going to-
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE
          MAN, removing him from the crowd. Dissent is not tolerated
          here. Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 22.

                    will understand the necessity of
                    this action. It was faith that
                    built this town - and faith that
                    will sustain it even through the
                    dark times that may lie ahead. But
                    it is always darkest before dawn -
                    and the new dawn is coming.
<b>                        (BEAT)
</b>                    May God go with you all.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among
          themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.
<b>          
</b>          As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.
<b>          
</b>          As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his
          bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each
          have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.
<b>          
</b>          We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the
          couple on the road under the freeway overpass.

</b>          Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the
          balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his
          grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.
<b>          
</b>          Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.

</b><b>          
</b>          What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the
          rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still
          impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
          leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.
          FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.
<b>          
</b>          The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON.
          Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A
          FIREPLACE sputters dimly.
<b>          
</b>          A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen
          or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.
<b>          
</b>          Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of
          his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.

</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX

</b>          Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR,
          licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie
          as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office".
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as
          when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance
          mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.

<b>          
</b>          Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.
<b>          
</b>          BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and

<b>          
</b>          We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure
          Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The

<b>          
</b>          Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the

<b>          
</b>          Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate.
          Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.

</b>          He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.

</b>          He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in
          the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of
          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.
<b>          
</b>          As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.

          pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.
<b>          
</b>          Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him
          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.
<b>          
</b>          The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.

<b>          
</b>          Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender
          takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.

<b>          
</b>          Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for
          sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
          pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.

</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    That's the best I got.
<b>          
</b>          The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat
          leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts
          with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.
<b>          
</b>          Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the
          biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.
<b>          
</b>          Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along
          with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.

          Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair
          tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's
          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
<b>          
</b>          The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara
          along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.

</b>          Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up
          and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.
          There's something about him she can't put her finger on...
<b>

          guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH
          RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.
<b>          
</b>          One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the
          front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card
          and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.
<b>          
</b>          Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging
          from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a
          few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak
          trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.

</b>          Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing
          more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
          his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.

</b>          It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases
          his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.

<b>

</b>          ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing.
          Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword
          held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.
<b>          
</b>          SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled

          the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.
<b>

          BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.
<b>          
</b>          Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes
          to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his
          sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.
<b>          
</b>          BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen
          in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.
<b>          
</b>          He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.
<b>          
</b>          Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at
          the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.

</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    It means we have laws here. Laws
                    set down long before any of us ever
                    walked this earth. And one of them
                    is, you don't eat the flesh of your
                    brother. Else you're no better than
                    an animal. And not welcome here.
<b>          
</b>          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.

</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    I had a battery needed charging and

                    come here looking for trouble.
<b>          
</b>          Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen,
          who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.

</b>          The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around

<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

<b>          
</b>          Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural
          element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.

                    the essential work others don't
                    want. And in return they eat, they
                    drink, they survive. Last year, a

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    It's not like I ever knew what I'm
                    missing. I was already used to
                    being like this by the time... by
                    the time it all happened. So I got
                    around pretty good even when I was
                    on my own. And now it's easy. I
                    know every creaky old floorboard in
                    here, and it's not like I ever go
                    any place else. Bill would never
                    allow it. He worries about me so
                    much.
<b>          
</b>          Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.
          Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I should go. He'll be wondering
                    where I am.
<b>

<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    Thank you. I enjoyed our

</b>          Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.

</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room
          mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    You took your time in there. How
                    long does it take to deliver a
                    plate of food and some water?
<b>          
</b>          A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    He wanted to talk.

</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    Nothing really. He asked me what it
                    was like to be blind.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    No. I don't think he likes to talk
                    about himself much.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    Yeah, I got that.
<b>          
</b>          Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I don't think he's going to change
                    his mind by morning. I don't think
                    he's going to stay.

</b>                    Just strikes me as the kind of man
                    who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
                    seem like the type to go changing

</b><b>                              CARNEGIE

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    You saw him. He's not like the
                    others. You won't be able to smooth-
                    talk him and wrap him around your
                    finger like you usually do.

</b>                    I'm sending Solara.
<b>          
</b>          Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA

</b>                    You know how often these walkers
                    get laid? Never. Least not by
                    anything living or willing. Girl
                    like her can be very persuasive.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    You can't send her in there with
                    him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    You went in there readily enough.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    That's different. Solara's just a
                    child, she can't-
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    She's a grown woman now, Claudia.
                    Sooner or later you're going to
                    have to accept that. She has to
                    earn her keep around here, same as
                    the rest of us.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA

</b><b>                                                                    45.

                    help us make our way in this world.
                    Some people's gift is more evident
                    than others. Solara's sure as hell
                    is.
<b>          
</b>          Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    What kind of a man are you?
<b>          
</b>          Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her
          menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    I'm the kind of man who'd pull a
                    helpless blind girl off the road, a
                    girl who'd been beaten and raped,
                    and give her a place where she can
                    live without fear! Without me you'd
                    be just another no-eye, lying dead
                    in the outland, picked clean by the
                    buzzards, or shoveling dirt down
                    there with the others. That's the
                    kind of man I am!
<b>          
</b>          He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I don't live without fear. I
                    haven't for a long time now.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    Where are you going?

</b><b>                              CLAUDIA
</b>                    I'm not going to let you do this.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.
<b>          
</b><b>                               CARNEGIE
</b>                    You're not going to let me?
<b>                        (BEAT)
</b>                    Nobody tells me what I can and
                    can't do in my own town. Nobody. I
                    built this world, and I am God
                    here! So don't go thinking about
                    screwing with my plans. You know
                    how this works. Solara goes against
                    me, you get hurt. You go against
                    me, she gets hurt.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 46.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          He releases his grip on her.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    So let's not see anybody get hurt.
                    Okay?
<b>          
</b>          He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly
          through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.

</b><b>          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
          oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old
          leather-bound book from his backpack.
<b>          
</b>          Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
          the book inside his shirt.
<b>          
</b><b>                               ELI

<b>          
</b>          The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than
          she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
          dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.
<b>          
</b>          Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at
          least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far
          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SOLARA

</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Someone was already here with food

</b><b>                              SOLARA

<b>          
</b>          She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very
          seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SOLARA

<b>          
</b>          She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns
          down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SOLARA

<b>          
</b>          She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light
          cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The
          silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
          oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.

                    lonely out there on the road.
<b>          
</b>          She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair
          cascades down. God damn, she looks good.

<b>          
</b>          She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the
          buttons of his shirt.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SOLARA

          He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.

</b><b>                               ELI
</b>                    I'm not.
<b>          
</b>          She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And
          then she seems a little insulted.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SOLARA

</b>          Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves
          to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.
<b>          
</b><b>                              SOLARA

<b>          
</b>          The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's

          about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.

<b>          
</b>          Claudia appears perturbed by Carnegie's subtle probing.
          Solara flashes him a frosty look.

                    come out and say it.

<b>          
</b>          Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOTGUN

          narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down.
<b>          
</b>          Eli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking. The shot
          HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST, dropping him to the dirt.
<b>          
</b>          Eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as more
          gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to
          collect himself, reloads the shotgun.
<b>          
</b>          The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily.
<b>          
</b>          Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the
          sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around
          the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN
          FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.
<b>

          wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.
<b>          
</b>          The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in
          the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their
          heads remaining.
<b>          
</b>          Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the
          perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free.
<b>          
</b>          And then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable.
<b>          
</b>          Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater,
          Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking
          angrily at her, shaking her.
<b>          
</b>          Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to
          the road again.

<b>

<b>          
</b>          He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him.
          Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw
          with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.

          against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the shotgun
          at Carnegie's head.

                    word of God to these poor
                    unfortunates here. To shine its
                    light upon them and give them
                    something in this wretched world
                    that they could believe in.
                    Something to live for! It's why I
                    built this town, did you know that?
                    All we've been missing is the word

          motion SLICING across the base of the statue.

</b>          Eli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes the
          harsh truth of it:

</b><b>                              ELI

                    do what I gotta do. Don't have no

                    don't want to be like me. You don't
                    want to spend your life alone.
<b>          
</b>          Solara steps closer, her eyes pleading.

                    alone. And neither would you.
<b>          
</b>          A long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appears as
          though Solara might have won him over. But then:

</b>          He turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. She stands
          there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away.

          off into the horizon. Getting smaller all the time.

</b><b>          EXT. DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A small, penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium
          containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. Goats,
          sheep, geese, pigs. Mostly mangy, sad-looking specimens.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed
          from a nearby sack onto the ground. He watches with
          satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed.
<b>          
</b>          Claudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack.

<b>          
</b>          Carnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli's
          pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.
<b>          
</b><b>                              REDRIDGE
</b>                    He killed four of my men and walked
                    out of town without a scratch. They
                    shot off a hundred rounds at him
                    and he didn't get hit once. I never
                    even heard of anything like that.
<b>          
</b>          Carnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a
          world of his own as he tends to the farm animals.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CARNEGIE
</b>                    You know, I always thought of
                    myself as a shepherd. Bringing
                    together the wayward and the lost.
                    Tending to my flock. But all the
                    things I want to do, I can't do
                    them on my own. The one thing I've
                    needed is the one thing that's
                    always been missing. Then one day
                    it walks right into town - so close
                    I can almost touch it - and then
                    walks right on out again.

                    It was done with the power of
                    words. I created this place out of
                    nothing, because people believed in
                    a promise that I sold to them.

                    into a nation. It will help me
                    build a new world. In my image.

</b>          In the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to
          her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara.
<b>          
</b>          Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from
          it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt.
<b>          
</b>          She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall,
          hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together.
<b>          
</b>          She inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean.
          Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.

</b>          She SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable.

<b>          
</b>          She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But
          the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the
          wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.
<b>          
</b>          She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's

</b>          The woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees,
          muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road.
<b>          
</b>          As Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling
          with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch,
          its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES.

<b>          
</b>          The woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate
          the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it.

          the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.

<b>          
</b>          Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench
          overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He
          licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.

</b>                    Well, let's find out.
<b>          
</b>          He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.
<b>          
</b>          We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.
<b>          
</b>          The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale,
          the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara
          look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.
<b>          
</b>          A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.
<b>          
</b>          There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down
          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood
          streams down his thighs. A real horror show.
<b>          
</b>          He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down
          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.
<b>          
</b>          The two other brigands release Solara and whip around,
          scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a
          RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.
<b>          
</b>          Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most
          terrifying thing either has ever seen.
<b>          
</b>          ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His
          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.
<b>          
</b>          He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
          trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.
<b>          
</b>          Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO
          THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft
          plugging the muzzle tight.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                  74.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Rifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS
          HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.
<b>          
</b>          Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his
          sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The
          two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.
<b>          
</b>          BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES
          ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the
          sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.
<b>          
</b>          The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His
          hand goes limp and drops the knife.
<b>          
</b>          And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost
          completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from
          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.
<b>          
</b>          Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
          on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their
          fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.
<b>          
</b>          He crouches down between them in the dust.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

                    for your sins so that your souls
                    may find salvation. Will you say
                    with me the act of contrition?
<b>          
</b>          The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.

</b><b>                                BRIGAND LEADER
</b>                    Fuck you.
<b>          
</b>          Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

<b>          
</b>          He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him
          off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.
<b>          
</b>          He turns to the other man, raising his sword.

</b><b>                              ELI

                    thee, and I detest all my sins.
<b>          
</b>          The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words
          quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI

<b>          
</b>          His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. Dead. Eli
          signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away.
<b>          
</b>          Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches and
          gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.

</b>          She laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. Grips him tighter.

</b>          He helps her up and escorts her back to the road.

</b>          A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.
<b>          
</b>          A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily
          modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its
          original form still recognizable underneath.
<b>          
</b>          It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer
          moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier.
<b>          
</b>          Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE
          GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.
<b>          
</b>          THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you

          from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG
          BURROWS dotted around.
<b>          
</b>          A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing
          the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.
<b>          
</b>          Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears

          camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.
<b>          
</b>          Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead

<b>          
</b>          When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the

          flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.
<b>          
</b>          Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out
          clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down

</b>          Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites
          into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it
          tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.

</b>          Eli smiles and shakes his head.

</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Christopher was a man who lived a
                    long time ago. He wanted to be a
                    good man, he wanted to help people.
                    So he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across. He was a big strong man and
                    there was no one he couldn't carry.
<b>          
</b>          Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELI
</b>                    Then one day a young child came to
                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across. Christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy. He was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried.
                    The boy explained that he was the
                    son of God, and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world. After that,
                    Christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river. And that's how he became
                    a saint. Later on, he was known as
                    the patron saint of travelers.

</b><b>          
</b>          The fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his
          pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat
          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.
<b>          
</b>          Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after
          all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so
          impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.

<b>          
</b>          No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his
          side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.
<b>          
</b>          She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing,
          stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel,
          hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.
<b>          
</b>          It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue
          colors faded and worn. It reads:

</b>          Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her
          attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.

</b>          There it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little
          package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST.
          She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark
          shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little
          scary to Solara.

</b><b>          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost
          every building burned or reduced to rubble.
<b>          
</b>          Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn
          but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its

<b>          
</b>          The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with
          SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot
          surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE.
<b>          
</b>          Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.

</b>          They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter
          fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK.
<b>          
</b>          Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the
          padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK.
<b>          
</b>          They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the
          yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS
          arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.

</b>          Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING
          STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet.
          Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down.

<b>          
</b>          A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at
          their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli
          drops his shotgun to the ground.
<b>          
</b>          They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.
<b>          
</b>          The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...
<b>          
</b>          AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat
          bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They
          look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
<b>          
</b>          Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN
          which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully.
          The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's
          shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.

</b>          The woman glares at him. The husband reluctantly accedes and
          moves to the concealed trap apparatus. Releases the rope,
          dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap.
<b>          
</b>          The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the

<b>          
</b><b>          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          It's like something out of the world before. The interior is
          almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany
          table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.
<b>          
</b>          Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and
          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.
<b>          
</b>          George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them
          inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.
<b>          
</b>          Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a
          tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact.
          She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.
<b>

                    or biscuits for the tea. They ran
                    out some time ago.
<b>          
</b>          She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not
          tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare
          at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly.
          It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
          civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.

</b>                    There's a disease in the outland.
                    Spread by eating human meat. It
                    affects the brain. Dementia, loss
                    of motor function. Did you notice
                    the old woman's hands shaking?
                    She's got it. They've both got it.

          He's still carrying that shotgun.

</b>          She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions.
          Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal:
<b>          
</b>          A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols.
          Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything.

          UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open.
<b>          
</b>          A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window. It lands in the
          dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge.
<b>          
</b>          Cautiously, he approaches. The package is wrapped in cloth
          and tied up with twine. It looks like Eli's bible.
<b>          
</b>          He picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. Folds away
          the cloth wrapping. Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
          object, at the words written on the front of it.

<b>          
</b>          He dives across the trunk of the Explorer into cover as THE

          lightweight Mini Cooper takes the main brunt and EXPLODES,
          cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck.
<b>          
</b>          Redridge looks around. Three men lie dead already. Flaming
          wreckage all around him. Suddenly, it's a war zone.

</b>          MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOUSE, peppering the
          vehicles' armor. The gunmen cower behind cover.

</b>          Redridge aims at the house and OPENS FIRE. Inspired by his
          example, the others follow. A HAIL OF BULLETS CRISS-CROSS
          BACK AND FORTH. The house's faded paint facade is shredded.

</b>          Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the

</b>          George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his
          wife tenderly by the hand for a moment.

          a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He
          CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.
<b>

          a stop.

          and moves through the smoke.

          and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon.

</b>          But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of

          best to hide his pain from Solara. She notices anyway.

          follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop
          and take in the view before them.
<b>          
</b>          THE PACIFIC OCEAN. Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the
          once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of
          neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the
          ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.
<b>          
</b>          On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little
          that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY
          DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings
          still standing looking on the verge of collapse.
<b>          
</b>          Solara looks at it all in horrified awe. Eli, unperturbed,
          keeps on moving, still clutching his side.

          stepping the fractures in the road.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          Eli leads Solara through the rubble of what used to be San
          Francisco. It's like walking through the wreckage of 9/11's
          Ground Zero, but a hundred times the scale. Horrifying.
<b>          
</b>          They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL, nothing but the lobby
          still standing. A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble.
<b>          
</b>          Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around
          ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully.

          more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the
          blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it.
<b>          
</b>          The buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares
          her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world.

</b>          Eli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing
          the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The
          celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped
          at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS.
<b>          
</b>          Eli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His
          breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAY

<b>          
</b>          Eli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end.
          The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a
          RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's
          sheared-off edge.
<b>

</b><b>          ALCATRAZ ISLAND
</b><b>          
</b>          Looking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated.
          The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It
          feels almost like a mythic place - the "promised land" Eli
          has sought for so many years.
<b>          
</b>          A tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze
          atop the prison lighthouse.
<b>

          feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters
          below close enough to lap around their ankles.

</b>          They look up. A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed
          in one of the perimeter towers. Training a rifle on them.

</b>          In the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on

<b>          
</b>          Keeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his
          free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear
          the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait.
<b>          
</b>          The guard puts away his radio and shouts back down:

          MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron.

</b>          Eli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside.

                    time now. Collected over thirty
                    thousand volumes from generous
                    donors all across the nation. We
                    even have a printing press that we

</b>          She unsheathes Eli's sword, plants it in the ground before
          his grave. Takes the BOOK from under her arm and opens it up.
<b>          
</b>          It's a NEW BIBLE. Crudely typeset from Lombardi's original
          transcription and printed on the prison press.
<b>          
</b>          She opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible
          over Eli's grave. We don't hear what she says.
<b>          
</b>          As Solara finishes her reading and closes the bible, LOMBARDI
          appears behind her.

                    You're welcome to stay here with
                    us. You'll be safe.

</b>          BEAT. Solara looks at the sword, her fingers playing across
          its hilt. The blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun.
<b>          
</b>          There is a determined, purposeful look in her eye.

</b>          The sun rises through the fog on the horizon.
<b>          
</b>          The great iron gates grind open. Solara emerges from inside
          the prison, steps out onto the island rock.

</b>          She is dressed in a flak jacket, combat pants and boots.
          Eli's old pack across her back. Hair tied in a neat pony
          tail. Atop that, Eli's ragged fur hat.

</b>                    Thank you for allowing me finally
                    to rest. I'm so very tired. The
                    time of my departure is at hand and
                    now I surrender my soul into your
                    care, at peace in knowing that I
                    have carried out your will. That I
                    have done right with my time on
                    this earth.

          and heads toward the sun on the horizon. Headed east.

</b>          As she walks away into the sun, her lonely silhouette on the
          road reminds us of Eli as we saw him so many times before.
