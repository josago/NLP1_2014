</b>    The huge printing PRESSES POUND out the morning edition,
    setting a rhythm that carries us through the scene as the
    newspapers are printed, collated, folded, and spit out
    onto a rapidly-growing stack.
    Pressmen bundle the papers and toss them into carts.        See
    the masthead: "THE NEW YORK WORLD, JULY 10, 1899."

    Two men push hard a cart loaded with papers to get it
    rolling down an iron ramp -- then have to run to keep up
    with it as it careens toward --

</b>    A large room filled with boys sleeping in hammocks,
    including JACK KELLY, snapping his fingers in his sleep.
    On the wall by his head, the commanding visage of Teddy
    Roosevelt grins down from a rotogravure photo. Kloppman
    wakes the boys, intoning his morning ritual:

</b>               Ink's wet, the presses are rolling,
               the papers are stacking -- rise
               and shine, make a dime, no news
               without the Newsies -- etc.
    Jack jumps out of his bunk and shakes the BOY below.

    Jack laughs and tosses him his crutch. The dorm is now
    alive with waking boys -- yawning, stretching, pulling
    on pants, hitching up suspenders as they sing --

    Teeth brushing, sponge baths       with cold water -- the older
    boys shave. Jack smears his        face with shaving cream as

     push with deliberate aggression past Jack and the boys.
     Tension, silence, then --

     day's receipts on it, looks up at his father proudly.

     Jack nods awkwardly, starts to say something when SARAH,
     16, enters from another room with an armload of lace
     piecework. She's beautiful -- Jack becomes instantly
     tongue-tied.

                 they just fired him. He's got no

      basins to the last one. He reaches beneath it,        dislodges
      a brick and removes a small box. In the box is        a tin
      Prince Albert Tobacco can -- Jack puts today's       take
      inside it. Then he removes --
      -- a photograph: faded, dog-eared. Against a Coney

      smiling man and woman beam down at a small boy in a
      cowboy hat -- it's Jack, about Les's age, with his

      -- beckons to Les, who runs to join him, thrilled.

                   little.

      Shouting encouragement, the Newsies clear a path as Jack
      and Les march up to the big doors. Jack pounds on them
      and there's a hush as everyone waits, watching -- including
      a handsome, well-dressed man in his thirties, BRYAN DENTON.

       the no-man's land of mud and junk. Boys appear like
       hostile Indians -- behind them, to the side of them, in
       front of them -- silently escorting them under the pier.
       David looks very nervous as they are halted, and the
       harmonica plays a signal, then stops abruptly.

       From behind some rotting timbers steps a freckled gnome.

       He turns and walks away. David and Boots exhale in
       relief -- but Jack suddenly grabs a rope hanging from
       the wharf and swings in front of Spot.

                    afraid to join the strike.
       Murder's in the air: David and Boots are paralyzed;
       the henchmen are ready to explode. Spot's eyes are
       locked on Jack's for an excruciating moment -- then
       Spot grins.

       With a bucket of red paint, Crutchy paints a portrait of
       Pulitzer on an old bedsheet. Around him, Newsies roll
       hoops, play marbles, tag, leap-frog, etc. Looks like
       more of a holiday than a strike. Jack, David, Boots
       return from Brooklyn.

      with the banner, the other Newsies begin to notice.

      -- The Delanceys slog through a storm of rotten fruit;
      cornering some Newsies by the wagons. They're raising
      their clubs when --
      -- Paint begins to dribble onto their heads -- they look
      up and the whole bucket is dumped in their faces by
      Crutchy. They lunge for him, dripping -- he ducks away,
      poking at them with his crutch --

       shrink slightly. Pulitzer studies him a moment.

       back at him.

      Crutchy hears something and quickly shushes them: Jack
      disappears from the window; Crutchy slumps into a bunk
      and pretends to sleep -- just as Snyder comes into
      the room. Utter silence --

      -- except for Snyder's FOOTSTEPS as he walks slowly down
      the aisle between the bunks. He stops at the window, his
      back to it. Crutchy sneaks open his eyes to see --
      -- Jack, behind Snyder, swinging past the window, arms
      stretched in a balletic arabesque --
      -- Crutchy struggles not to laugh; Tenpin and some others
      see what's going on. They all fight laughter as --
      -- Jack swings back and forth behind Snyder, striking
      difference poses as he passes the window: the breast
      stroke, running on air, a bird with flapping wings...

      -- From the roof, David looks down in disbelief: then
      smiles -- nothing Jack does would surprise him any more.
      -- Snyder glares suspiciously at the boys, sensing
      something is going on. Behind him, Jack floats past
      as an angel -- Snyder wheels around, looks --
      -- but the window is empty. Puzzled, he walks out
      of the room. The instant he's gone, the boys explode
      in stifled laughter. We MOVE IN ON Crutchy as he
      laughs until the tears come...

     there is a smattering of APPLAUSE. They look to see --

     -- At the door,      the group of reporters applauding --
     guilty applause      maybe, but still applause. One of them
     takes a dollar      and puts it in the box marked NEWSIES
     STRIKE FUND --      another follows suit, then another, and
     another...

     Jack and the Newsies watch -- then Jack begins to applaud
     the reporters. The Newsies join in, clapping, whistling,
     as the reporters hurry out, feeling a little better about
     themselves.

</b>      The SONG fills the hall as Jack, happy and proud, sees
      Sarah smiling at him, reaches out his hand and pulls her
      on stage. David is watching this when someone signals
      him -- Denton, who points his finger at --
      Snyder    edging closer to Jack, checking the time on his
      pocket    watch. He has something in his  hand -- a tin
      police    whistle. He puts it to his lips  and is about to
      blow it    when Denton moves up behind him and --
<b>                                DENTON
</b>                  Aren't you Warden Snyder?

</b>                  I'm Denton of The Sun. I've heard
                  about your work with young people.
                  I wonder if you'd agree to an
                  interview?
      Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers
      his police whistle, smiling modestly.


<b>      ON STAGE
</b>      David tries to move to Jack to warn him but Race and the
      others have formed a chorus line and drag him into it.
      David shouts over the song --

                  Is it Snyder as in 'snide'?
      Furious, Snyder blows the police whistle for all he's
      worth. Instantly police burst in from every door -- all
      converging on Jack. Immediately he leaps off the stage
      into the arms of several boys below -- then fights his
      way out the front door --

       clubs in their hands. They    start toward him and suddenly
       disappear -- straight down   the trap door that's suddenly

      David is hiding by the gates with the lynch-pin in his
      hand. Snyder is waiting by the carriage. The front door
      opens -- Seitz and Jack walk out and appear at the top of
      the entrance stairs. David calls out --

       away from Seitz, slides down a bannister, and leaps to
       the ground. Snyder lunges for Jack, who manages to evade
       Snyder's reach.

       The driver whips the horse forward but is jerked off his
       seat as the carriage separates. The horse runs off.
       Amidst the confusion, David and Jack tear through the
       gates way ahead of Snyder.

       As Jack steps back into the light, the CAMERA WIDENS and
       we realize he's back in the House of Refuge. Jack begins
       to sing softly: REPRISE: "SANTA FE."

       Jack sits in a small dark room -- an isolation room;
       moonlight shines through barred windows; there's a door
       with a small serving panel in it.

       SUPERIMPOSED a series of living portraits of the
       working children of the 1890s... young boys in too-
       large caps and too-small coats, holding lunchpails...
       holding picks and shovels far too large for them...
       girls in shapeless dresses sewing, or scrubbing...
       shining eyes, dirty faces... sad expressions beginning
       to bloom into hope as they snatch and read the news that
       the headline proclaims as it whirls TOWARD us ON the

       We see that same headline across --

<b>185B   INT. MANSION - BACK OF MAN'S HEAD - MORNING                185B
</b>
       as he reads the Newsie News at breakfast attended by a
       butler (the Rough Rider) in a khaki uniform. He's
       reading a headline: "HOUSE OF REFUGE, HOUSE OF SHAME"
       with a subhead beneath it: "SCANDAL HIDDEN FROM TEDDY
       ON VISIT." We glimpse a famous walrus mustache as the
       Man slams his fist on the table in anger. A figure steps
       INTO FRAME across the table: Denton.

       The Rough Rider snaps out a silk hat and a silverheaded
       walking stick. Teddy snatches them as if they were
       armor.

       line up, clubs in hand.

      stick in salute to Jack across the square.

      Jack looks at the coach, torn. Boots holds the bundle of
      belongings he gave him earlier. Suddenly Jack decides,
      snaps his fingers, Boots tosses him the bundle.

      look stunned, dismayed -- Jack avoids their eyes. Behind
      them, the BELL RINGS, the circulation window opens for
      business -- a crowd of Newsies races to line up. The
      gang looks at them hungrily, eager to return the work.
      They look at Jack.

       Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns,
       runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards
       the coach. Les starts after him -- David catches him,

       -- Jack climbing into the coach, greeted by Teddy.          The
       door closes, the coach trots away. "SANTA FE" is
       underscored.
       As the coach moves off, the Newsies move up, waving their
       caps goodbye. David and Sarah watch, feeling a great
       loss; Les is crushed. The Newsies move into the court-
       yard, trying to keep their spirits up as:
