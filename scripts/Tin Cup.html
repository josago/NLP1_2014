    TINNY CHEATIN' HEART MUSIC, the dull GROAN of a TRACTOR,
    CRICKETS CHIRPIN' love songs, sporadic ZAPS from BUG
    LIGHTS, and an occasional random THWOCK as we --

    Out west where the sun descends gloriously over desolate
    mountains. A sense of timeless and incorruptible beauty
    if you ignore the TWANG of the MUSIC, the SPUTTER of the
    TRACTOR, the ZAPS, the THWACKS... and something else...

    ... MEN'S VOICES.   Garrulous with drink, fraternity and
    amusement.

    We PAN DOWN TO:

    A man, JOSE, is on the roof, wrestling with a rickety
    satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work.
    (We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he
    struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.)

    Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of
    yellow into the gathering darkness. ROY "TIN CUP" McAVOY
    stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest
    light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them,
    really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between
    his legs. Behind him:

    A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin
    Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT,
    EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his
    preferred libation in the other. They're all looking
    back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back
    wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:

    ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of
    the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time
    bookie and full-time driving range man. Born across the
    river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante,
    best friend.

<b>                             ROMEO
</b>               Okay, all bets are down!

    Their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful,
    until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheers
    triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about
    how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.

</b><b>                                                                   2.
</b><b>                             ROMEO
</b>               Number one is the winner! Dewey
               has the winner. Pays five to two!

     Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from
     the losers. It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing
     gambling. Tin Cup looks over.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               Don't you shitheels ever get
               bored?

     The regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the
     negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the
     bug lights.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               ... 'Cuz I got a riddle.

     Tin Cup leads the regulars inside.

     Tin Cup holds court.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               Takes about two ounces of brains
               to figure it out. Anyone think
               they got a brain with two ounces
               of brains in it?

     The regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to
     reveal the heft of their brains.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               For Chrissakes, boys! A little
               self-confidence from the players'
               gallery. We ain't talking long
               division.

<b>                             EARL
</b>                      (timidly)
               How much we gotta lose?

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               You want to liven things up, Earl?
               That's a hell of an idea. Say
               everyone puts in twenty bucks and
               the pot goes to whoever solves the
               riddle.

<b>                             DEWEY
</b>               You going to get the riddle, Tin
               Cup?
<b>
</b><b>                                                            3.

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>                 (patiently)
          Dewey. I'm the one asking the
          riddle. I already know the
          answer. I don't getta guess.
          Although... We could say if I get
          to five hundred bounces and no one
          gets the riddle, I get the pot.
          And I know what you're thinking.
          It's an impossible riddle. Well,
          It's not. It's an easy riddle.
          And if somehow by the grace of
          fluke luck I win, and you all
          don't agree it was an easy
          riddle, hell, I'll refund your
          money.

<b>                        EARL, CLINT & ALL
</b>          I'm in... We're in... Count us
          in... etc...

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          Okay, a man's driving down the
          road with his son and they get
          in a crash. Two ambulances come
          and take the man and his son to
          different hospitals. Son goes
          into the operating room, the
          doctor looks at him and says, 'I
          can't operate on this boy. He's
          my son.' How's that possible?
                 (beat)
          The clock's ticking boys...

Tin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge.

<b>                        EARL
</b>          Father didn't sneak back in,
          right? He's still at the other
          hospital?

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          It ain't 'Star Trek,' Earl.   No
          one beamed him aboard.

That eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds.
The men think harder.

<b>                        EARL
</b>          Well... if the father married the
          son's daughter --

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          It's a family riddle, Earl.   Think
          clean thoughts.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                   4.
</b>    The regulars puzzle some more.

<b>                            CLINT
</b>              Give us a little hint.

<b>                            MOLLY (O.S.)
</b>              The doctor's a woman.

    All heads turn to take in the arrival of:


<b>3   MOLLY GRISWOLD                                             3
</b>
    Standing just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced
    beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new
    everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new
    clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks
    like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest. And all
    the men are asking themselves the same question: what's
    she doing here? The silence invites Molly to supply the
    riddle's answer.

<b>                            MOLLY
</b>              The doctor is the son's mother.
              Feminists pose the riddle to
              reveal how deeply our sexual
              stereotypes run.
                     (directly to Tin Cup)
              I take it you're a feminist?

    Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the
    spell. The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response.

<b>                            TIN CUP
</b>              Ma'am, I've been called a lot of
              things -- but no one's ever
              saddled me with that one.

<b>                            MOLLY
</b>              You might try being saddled
              sometime -- the smell of leather,
              the sting of a whip...

    The regulars snicker, enjoying her one-upmanship.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>                     (slightly taken
                      aback)
              I'm just a humble golf pro...

<b>                            MOLLY
</b>              You're Roy McAvoy the golf pro? I
              pictured something... different.
              I have a seven o'clock lesson.

<b>                            TIN CUP
</b>              I thought I had a Doctor Griswold

</b><b>                                                                   5.
</b>              at seven.

    They hurry out to the range, Tin Cup oblivious to his
    gaffe.

    And the regulars gather to look out the window --


<b>4   THEIR POV - THROUGH WINDOW                                 4
</b>
    To the range, where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup is
    discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost.

<b>5   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT                                 5
</b>
    The lesson begins. Tin Cup can be slightly condescending
    in these situations, though she's got him a little wary.

<b>                            TIN CUP
</b>              The first thing you gotta learn
              about this game, Doc, is it ain't
              about hitting a little white ball
              into some yonder hole. It's about
              inner demons and self-doubt and
              human frailty and overcoming all
              that crap. So... what kinda
              doctor'd you say you were?

<b>                            MOLLY
</b>              I'm a psychologist -- in layman's
              terms call me a neo-Jungian, post-
              modern Freudian, holistic
              secularist.

<b>                               TIN CUP
</b>              Damn.

    She begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every
    golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull
    your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from
    your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.

<b>                            MOLLY
</b>              Inner demons and human frailty are
              my life's work. I used to
              practice in El Paso but I've moved
              here now...

<b>                               TIN CUP
</b>              What're those?

<b>                            MOLLY
</b>              I ordered these from the Golf
              Channel.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           6.

He stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some
of this stuff. He's enchanted and dismayed.

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          That stuff's a waste of money.

<b>                        MOLLY
</b>          I'm sure there are excesses and
          repetitions here, but I believe in
          the gathering of knowledge and I
          figured, well, there must be some
          truths about the golf swing
          illustrated by these devices --
          and that you'd help me sort
          through it.

She stands there with contraptions coming from every
limb.

<b>                        MOLLY
</b>          I have dozens of golf videotapes,
          too... And a golf watch.

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>                 (irritated, impatient)
          Take it off. All of it. Now!
          You're a smart woman, for
          Chrissakes -- don't you know the
          work of charlatans when you see
          it?

She deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile.

<b>                        MOLLY
</b>          No. I can always tell when
          someone is lying to himself, but
          I'm quite susceptible and
          frequently wrong when that person
          lies to me.
                 (pointing to the
                  pile of devices)
          That stuff cost me over 200
          dollars --

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          Then it's 200 dollars of shit...

He tees a ball, hands Molly her driver and steps back.

<b>                         TIN CUP
</b>          Go ahead.   Take a swing.

Molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters
under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          7.
</b><b>                        MOLLY
</b>          Aw, fuck...

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          Well, you talk like a golfer --

Molly unloads a mighty second swing. The club head
bounces off the mat. The ball sits untouched.

<b>                        MOLLY
</b>          Shit.

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          'Fuck...' 'Shit...' these are
          highly technical golf terms and
          you're using them on your first
          lesson -- this is promising.

<b>                        MOLLY
</b>          Awright, wise ass, show me.

Tin Cup takes the club from Molly, motions for her to
step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the
night.

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          Something like that.

He hands her back the club and tees up another ball.
Molly just looks at him.

<b>                        MOLLY
</b>          Impressive. Y'know, I tend to
          process things verbally. Can you
          break down into words how you did
          that?

Tin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech.

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          'What is the golf swing?' -- by
          Roy McAvoy.
                 (beat)
          The golf swing is a poem.

<b>                        TIN CUP (CONT'D)
</b>          Sometimes a love sonnet and
          sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is
          organic and of a piece, yet it
          breaks down into elegant stanzas
          and quatrains. The critical
          opening phrase of this song is the
          grip, in which the hands unite to
          form a single unit by the simple
          overlap of the smallest finger...
                 (displays grip)
          ... held lightly, a conductor's
<b>
</b><b>                                         8.
</b>baton.
       (starts swing)
Lowly and slowly the clubhead is
pulled back, led into position
not by the hands but the body
which turns away from the target,
shifting to the right side without
shifting balance. Tempo is
everything, perfection unobtainable,
as the body coils, now to the top
of the swing, in profound equilibrium.
And then a slight hesitation, a nod
to the gods...

<b>              MOLLY
</b>A nod to the gods?

<b>              TIN CUP
</b>To the gods, yes... that he is
fallible. As the weight shifts
back to the left pulled now by
powers inside the earth -- it's
alive, this swing, a living
sculpture -- and down through
contact, always down, into terra
firma, striking the ball crisply
-- with character -- a tuning
fork goes off in your heart, your
balls -- such a pure feeling is
the well-struck golf shot -- And
then the follow through to finish,
always on line -- The reverse 'C'
of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's
power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's
Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of
Hogan, the unfinished symphony of
Roy McAvoy.

<b>                MOLLY
</b>What?    What's unfinished?

<b>              TIN CUP
</b>I have a short follow through --
my swing can look unfinished.

<b>                MOLLY
</b>Why?

<b>              TIN CUP
</b>Some say it's because that's the
best way to play through the winds
of West Texas... and some say it's
because I never finish anything.
You can decide. The point is every
finishing position is unique as if
that is the signature left to the
artist, the warrior athlete who,
<b>
</b><b>                                                       9.
</b>          finally and thereby, has asserted
          his oneness with and power over the
          universe by willing a golf ball to
          go where he wants and how and when,
          because that is what the golf swing
          is about...
                 (finally)
          It is about gaining control of
          your life, and letting go at the
          same time.

Molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.

<b>                           MOLLY
</b>          Jeez Louise...

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          There is only one other acceptable
          theory of how to hit a golf ball.

<b>                        MOLLY
</b>          I'm afraid to ask. What's the
          other theory?

<b>                        TIN CUP
</b>          Grip it and rip it.

<b>                        MOLLY
</b>          While I appreciate your poetic
          sensibility, Mr. McAvoy --

<b>                        TIN CUP

like bowling pins, and --

The three dog clears the pileup, untouched, hugging the
rail. It has a ten length lead as it moves down the
backstretch and past the toteboard. The race is over --
the three dog wins.

Deathly silence. Somebody flips OFF the TV. Finally,
in a lame attempt to lighten the moment, Romeo speaks --

some official-looking papers. He hands them to her.

          it's worth twelve grand... more or

Tin Cup with surprise.

<b>                         DOREEN

caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune. Then
she starts to consider the idea more seriously.

Tin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway.

Tin Cup can't quite believe this offer from his old

grabs Simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing
with enthusiasm.

          about themselves for having to

Simms reaches for the seven iron.   Tin Cup clamps a hand
over the club.

grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. Tin Cup
mutters to the gallery.

     Simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and:


16   Stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into  16
     the lake. MICKELSON and GARY McCORD, the other team in

     Simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of
     the water to a smattering of polite applause.

               Peter, I've done a little
               background here -- this unfolding
               disaster's a driving range pro
               named Roy McAvoy, who everyone
               calls Tin Cup. Locals claim he
               he was a pretty good college lick
               and knocked around the mini-tours...

20   Tin Cup steps up to hit the shot.   McCord lowers his     20
     voice.

                             McCORD
               ... but I guarantee you, he's
               about to suffer brain arrest.
               He's thinking about the cameras
               and the gallery and the water, and
               all that gray matter between his

               incidentally, Stadler's got it booked
               at ten to one...

     Tin Cup swings, and:

21   The CAMERA PICKS UP the ball arching high and true off  21
     the club. It lands on the green. The CROWD ROARS... and
     the roar becomes deafening as the ball rolls three feet
     from the pin.

     David Simms helping some guy over the gallery rope.
     Simms walks the guy back to his golf bag... and now Tin

               from two fifty. Gimme that bag.

     Tin Cup reaches for the bag. The guy holds onto it.
     They wrestle briefly, as Simms sighs with fatigue and
     looks for a marshal.

     Tin Cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals
     approaching. He turns his anger on Simms.

     Tin Cup goes after the bag again. The guy still hangs
     on. The marshals arrive, and begin to wrestle with Tin
     Cup. He goes berserk... a WWF battle royal.

past a local and a sectional
qualifier, and unlike Doral or
Colonial or the A.T.T., they can't
keep you out. They can't ask you

     Boone looks at his own sixty-foot putt and he knows he's
     just been had... utterly, embarrassingly, and thoroughly.

      Tin Cup's Caddy pulls up and   he gets out, goes to the

      He looks around warily -- as   if someone might see him
      entering such a place -- and   ducks inside.

      It's the exit, "cool down" room, not the waiting room.

      Tin Cup sits nervously, he's slightly overdressed for
      the occasion. He looks childlike.

      The door to the inner office opens -- a woman comes out
      and sits down across from him. She's weeping
      uncontrollably. He stares. He fidgets. He's nervous,
      out of place.

      Finally Molly enters through the same door because she
      hears the crying. She sees Tin cup -- an awkward moment,
      then --

      Molly enters and sits down.

        (deep breath)
Suppose there's this guy. He's
standing on the shore of a big,
wide river. And the river's fulla
all manner of disaster, like
alligators and piranhas and
currents and eddies, and most
people won't even go down there to
dip a toe. But on the other side
of the river's a million dollars,
and on this side of the river
there's a rowboat. I guess my
question's this: What would
possess the guy on shore to swim
for it?

<b>                 MOLLY
</b>He's an idiot.

<b>              TIN CUP
</b>No. He's a hell of a swimmer,
see. His problem's more like...
why's he always gotta rise to the
challenge?

<b>              MOLLY
</b>He's a juvenile idiot.

<b>              TIN CUP
</b>You don't understand what I mean
by the river.

<b>              MOLLY
</b>We're talking about you and what
you like to call your inner
demons, Roy, that human frailty
you like to blather about, not
some mytho-poetic metaphor you
come up with in a feeble and
transparent effort to do yourself
credit.

<b>              TIN CUP
</b>Y'mean you're gonna make me feel
lousy? I came here to feel better
-- what kinda therapy is this?

<b>              MOLLY
</b>You don't have any inner demons.
What you have is inner crapola,
inner debris -- garbage, loose
wires, horseshit in staggering
amounts.

<b>               MOLLY

</b>Not yet.

<b>              MOLLY

<b>              TIN CUP
</b>She's seeing a guy. I don't know

<b>              MOLLY

dinner -- then it would force
these issues out in the open.

that all your speeches about
swimming across the shark infested

golf game -- not about your

Tin Cup rises with new confidence. He does several deep
breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage. She
stares at him. And he walks right up to her.

          smitten more every day I think
          about you -- and the fact that

     and the occasional BUG-LIGHT ZAPPING a fly.

     Romeo and the regulars stand behind Tin Cup observing

They murmur approval, but Earl catches Clint's eye and
jerks his head at Tin Cup, indicating Clint isn't doing
his job as group spokesman. Clint takes a step forward.

               You're messing up my

     to mess up Tin Cup's concentration. And he pulls out
     another ball, mutters dollar bills, and hits another
     perfect shot.

Romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it     over his knee,

He drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and
steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven
iron from his bag.

He snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the
crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire.

     Then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven
     iron. The regulars hold their breath, thinking this is
     the end of Tin Cup's Open bid. But...

     Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron
     affectionately.

<b>                             TIN CUP

               the seven iron. It's the only
               truly safe club in my bag.

     He moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the
     middle with the seven iron.

<b>                             TIN CUP

launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some
driving range markers... to "oohs" and "ahhs" from his

Simms is cool as ice. He smiles, then moves around to
the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the
course. This baffles everyone.

     About three miles, forever. It's probably still going...

who writhes only a few feet away.

The Guy slides over to Tin Cup, quickly joined by his
buddies.

          grip. But you look at Couples,

Tin Cup glances at the guy's grip.

</b>          No, grip it like this, so you're
          holding on with the last two
          fingers of your left hand.

The Guy nudges the COWBOY next to him.

</b>          See that? Tin Cup McAvoy says you
          grip a golf club like this, with

Sammantha can't keep their attention, either, even though
she's down to a G-string, inches away. At the height of
the MUSIC, she stops dancing and looks down at Doreen --

     shafting glubs.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               Romes!  You've come back!
                      (no answer)
               You shoulda been there, Romes, I
               drained a 30-foot snake to
               qualify!
                      (off no answer)
               Earl gave me a straight read --
               the thing broke half a dozen times
               -- missed ya, pods!

     Romeo gives him the silent treatment.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               Okay, don't talk to me -- but
               you're still my guy...
                      (losing patience)
               It's a little late to be pissed
               off! We're in the Open! You and
               me!

     Still nothing from Romeo.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               Awright, be that way --
                      (switches course)
               -- say... has Molly been around?

<b>                             ROMEO
</b>               I knew you had the hots for her.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               What's this? Garbo speaks? Of
               course I have the hots for her and
               I'm doing a damn good job of
               keeping things platonic and
               professional till I kick Simms'
               ass and show her I ain't who she
               thinks I am because, in fact, I am
               who she thinks I am but if I win
               the Open I won't be.

     Romeo stares back at that curious logic.

<b>                             ROMEO
</b>               Well, I don't think her nor me nor
               the God of Golf his self can keep
               you from blowing up in the Open...

           You're complaining again! Romeo's
           back! Whining, bitching, pissed
           off -- you're my man!

Silence.   Some chagrin.

           to be your caddie?

<b>                         TIN CUP
</b>           He was a wheezing heart attack

           I carried my bag the last four
           holes. I love ol' Earl but I need

</b>           If you can remove the sexual
           connotations and overlay a golf
           theme, Romeo -- I am your Juliet.

Romeo ponders it all.

     They shake hands.

</b>               Awright... now that we got that
               bullshit outta the way, I'm gonna
               hit me some balls and start oilin'
               that sweet swing o' mine for the
               big boys...

     Romeo sits back in the shade, still washing the thousands
     of golf balls in the rack, watching as --


79   Tin Cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble           79
     ground, pulls out a club and limbers up.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               Somethin' about that chick...

     Tin Cup addresses the ball and takes a swing.    Everything
     looks normal in his swing, but...

     Thwock! -- the BALL squirls off to the side and RATTLES
     against a fence. Ugly.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               Hmmm... little chili dipper
               there...

<b>                             ROMEO
</b>               Be sure to do that in the Open.

     Unfazed, Tin Cup steps up to hit again, but... once
     more --

     Thwock! -- Another horrible-looking squib to the right.

     Romeo stops washing balls and notices, watching Tin Cup.

     Thwock, thwock! -- Something's terribly wrong.

with the boys.

     Tin Cup stands there caught, like a deer in the
     headlights, like a man caught cross dressing, a private
     confession made public -- he can't run and he can't
     hide...

     Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy is wearing every gimmick that Molly
     first arrived with -- plus many more. He wears a
     pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curious
     triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his
     elbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle anchor, an arrow
     attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, he
     swings a collapsible club... and a BEGINNERS GOLF VIDEO
     PROJECTS loudly from his VCR, so loudly that he never
     heard her knocking.

<b>                                MOLLY

     A moment of pathetic silence, then:

     Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed.

<b>                             TIN CUP
</b>               The therapist laughs at her
               patient? Is that how it works? A
               man is laid bare before God and
               he's the butt of the cosmic joke?

Tin Cup lets down. The wind goes out of his sails and he
loses his defensiveness.

<b>                         TIN CUP
</b>          Well, God damn... a lost and

          the day you showed up wearing
          this stupid stuff and the whole
          damn thing has both inspired
          me to get here on the verge of
          greatness yet it's also caused
          me to get the shanks which
          could humiliate me in front of
          a zillion people.
                 (beat)
          Such is life. So dump that phony
          bastard and come to the Open in my
          corner -- you can delay your
          romantic urges, which I know are
          lurking in there among the excess

          Tell me you're not at least
          moderately attracted to me.

Tin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from
his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows --
for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks.

Tin Cup doesn't respond, just asks the Guard:

     the ballpark.

     practice balls lying there on the tee.

               free shit we might even pay for
               this fiasco.

     Tin Cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real
     legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful
     shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease.

<b>                             ROMEO
</b>               You think it would be
               inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for

hitting a group of U.S. Open officials. Heads turn.

Tin Cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to
strike another ball.

</b>           If you're the Mexican Mac O'Grady,

           too late, I'm off plane, I ain't
           dropping in -- oh, God, my swing
           feels like an unfolding lawn chair.

</b>          Very good. Now tie your left
          shoelace in a double knot.

     Again to GEORGE JONES on the CASSETTE PLAYER, Tin Cup is

     Romeo sits on the couch, stone cold sober, pouring drink

      around the room with his driver until, finally, he
      collapses in a heap on the floor. Romeo looks down

      The first tee -- the early morning air is heavy and
      still. The course is quiet and wet with dew. The
      gallery is sparse. The silence is broken by the
      starter's voice.

      A half-dozen people clap, and --

      Tin Cup and Romeo stagger to the tee, barely making it on
      time. Tin Cup is massively hung-over and unshaven.

<b>                              TIN CUP

                like you used to...

      Tin Cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried
      practice swings. The early tee times are strictly for
      the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around.
      Tin Cup's hand shakes as he closes the Velcro flap on his
      glove. He's wearing the hat and shirt with the sew-on
      patches, as he stares down the first fairway.

      Romeo hands him a driver.

someone hands him a club. Suddenly there's a crowd,
including Gary McCord who's been watching from the far

                 enabling the players to take dead
                 aim at the flags. Still, the
                 unswerving courage of an unknown
                 driving range pro from Salome has
                 raised that humble journeyman from
                 the ashes of an ignominious
                 eighty-three to wave a mighty fist
                 at the pantheon of golf's
                 immortals. This man, this Roy
                 McAvoy has laid siege to the
                 record book by birdieing the first
                 seven holes. A brave par from the
                 water at eight, and a glorious
                 birdie three at the daunting
                 twelfth, another at thirteen...

      Tin Cup and Romeo survey the shot -- a long downhill
      carry over a lake to a slightly elevated green. A shot
      similar to the one he pulled off at the best-ball.

      Tin Cup looks at the iron Romeo proffers. He looks back
      at the shot, throws some grass in the air, testing the
      wind. He looks at the gallery, the lake, the green, the
      whole grand setting... and then:

      He locates Molly behind the gallery ropes, watching.    She
      makes a little charging gesture with her fist. And:

      Tin Cup reaches defiantly past Romeo and pulls out the
      three wood.

                of him, Jim. If he lays up he
                takes bogey out of play.

                And he still has to think about
                making the cut.

      his ball... And he swings -- The ball arches off his
      club, the gallery roars, and...

      tees his ball. Stepping back to line up his shot, he
      peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of

                have just taken iron off the tee

      Tin Cup glares balefully back at McCord. Then he walks
      over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green
      from it. He walks back for his ball, turns to McCord...
      and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in Tin Cup's

      and:

      He swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and...

      ... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and...

      ... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and
      trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin.

      collecting his money from McCord while jabbing a taunting
      finger at Simms.

      he puts the club back and reaches for an iron. Tin Cup

          Hit the lay up. Hole a wedge for
          goddamn eagle.

Tin Cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the
green, the gallery, the whole grand setting... and he
seeks out Molly's face in the crowd. He moves over so
she can hear him.

                took himself out of the tournament
                with that drop. He could have
                walked up to the hazard line,
                saved par with a wedge and forced
                a playoff with Jacobsen. Now he
                needs a miracle shot.

                Ken, I'm right behind McAvoy here.
                And all he said to his caddie was:

      again, and once again...
