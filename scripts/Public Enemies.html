<b>          INT. PONTIAC - "RED" HAMILTON ( 34)
</b>
           looks at his watch. With his meticulously parted red hair, he
           might be a bank president. It's 6:55 a.m.

<b>          HAMILTON
</b>          Time.
          Thirty year old JOHN HERBERT DILLINGER is in the backseat. He
          nods. His arms are behind him. We don't know why. Red starts
          the car and drives forward.

</b>

<b>          CONVICTS
</b>          Its cold.-Convicts' uniforms are broadly striped and frayed.
          This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair,
          broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression
          has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There's
          nothing beaten down about these men. Like Alcatraz,
          Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line.

<b>          PRISON GUARDS
</b>          in visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam
          Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs watch the line,
          poised to unleash violence.

<b>          AMONG THE HARD MEN ARE...
</b>          HARRY "PETE" PIERPONT (32), 6 foot 1 with eerie blue eyes.
           Brilliant, violent, he hates all authority.
          CHARLES MAKLEY ( 44), squat with an anvil jaw, facial scars
           and as calm as Pierpont is volatile.
          HOMER VAN METER (27), tall, an incorrigible clown and an
          unemotional killer. He has continued to ridicule guards even
          when it cost him months in the hole.

          watches through a window as a Pontiac pulls into the parking
          area in front of the prison across from the streetcar tracks.
          Hamilton jerks a handcuffed Dillinger out of the backseat.
          Dillinger is shoved forward. Hamilton's wearing a star.

          Hamilton flashes the badge. He shoves Dillinger inside. In an
          adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker. Next to them is a
          barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door locks
          behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have
          entered. Meanwhile...

          sounds. Door opens. Convicts enter. Walter Dietrich goes
          right to the stacks and pulls a box with an "X" crayoned on
          the side. Its labeled "Thread."
          (Dietrich was mentored by Herbert K. Lamm, an ex-Prussian
          soldier who invented professional bank robbery by applying
          military tactics and who rode with Butch & Sundanc4's Hole in
          the Wall Gang in Utah in 1901. in prison Dietrich passed on
          Lamm's techniques. His brightest student in 1933 is..'ohn
          Herbert Dillinger.)

          Meter. Under spools are four Colt 45 automatics with loaded
          magazines.

<b>          GUARD DAINARD
</b>           is approached by Pierpont, who shoves the 45 in his face.

          Dillinger's insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn't see
          Hamilton bat a Thompson submachine gun across the back of his
          head and swing it onto the Two Guards...

          Dillinger's cuffs fell away. Now his Thompson covers the

          Hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out. Smooth. He
          crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks. So far, so
          good...

          Dillinger falls away. Dillinger and Pierpont grab Walter's
          arms. He's-paralyzed now. They try to pull him onto the
          running boafd, of the moving car.
          Dietrich's"hcpeful eyes look up at them. Then his eyes glaze
          over. His feet drag down the street. He's dead and they know
          it. They let go.

          Dillinger sees the abject fear in Shouse's eyes. And
          Dillinger's mood swings. He lowers the shotgun... Then, he
          snaps the butt across Shouse's face. Breaks Shouse's
          cheekbone. Dillinger pulls back and slams the heavy butt dead
          center, smashing Shouse's nose and orbital socket. Dillinger

          A busted-out farmer, EDWIN NORRIS, hurriedly pours coffee
          from a kettle into tin mugs and a thermos. A WOMAN at a stove

          Viola retrieves her toddler brother who's crawled into the

          rejected.

<b>          HOOVER

          crime.
          J. EDGAR HOOVER is a physically short man but has a dynamic

          build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger
          straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing

          he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of

          She laughs at the flattery. Holds his eyes a beat with an

          expect that. Her eyes are wide. He opens and wraps her in his
          overcoat, their bodies close to each other.
          She kisses him back, long and deep. And she didn't expect to
          do that, either.

          went around to churches and put on plays
          like "Little Fireface." And nothing

          either. So I haven't been anywhere or
          done anything in my whole life except
          come to Chicago and try to make my way.

          Your honor! Are we to have a hearing in
          accord with the laws of this nation, or
          is the State to be permitted to incite an
          atmosphere of prejudice? The very air
          reeks with the bloody rancor of
          intolerant malice. The clanging of
          shackles brings to our minds the dungeons
          of the Czars, not the flag-bedecked
          liberty of an American courtroom. I

          across the street and jumps onto Nelson's back. Nelson,
          screaming with rage, throws him through a plate glass window,
          FIRES two rounds and runs to join the others -- PURE CHAOS.
          Dillinger throws Nelson in the car.

          core truth. This is the only end for Blackie Gallagher. And
          its as true for john Dillinger in his life as it is for
          Gallagher. Actions and historical forces have made his time
          be up.
          Dillinger SLOWS the flickering images. His concentration
          slices time into component parts. Gable exchanges last good-
          byes. He warns his D.A. friend, Ronald Coleman, not to
          commute his sentence. The images play on Dillinger's face.

          Any handcuffs around here?
          They don't have any. They had not planned on needing them.
          One agent is excited. His gun pointed at Karpis shakes.

<b>          HOOVER
</b>          Karpis said he'd never be taken alive,
          but I took him without firing a shot.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          That marks him as a yellow rat. He was
          scared to death when I arrested him.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          That's all I got to say.
          Suydam and the special publicist, COURTNEY COOPER address the

          waits. It looks like he's been waiting for awhile. People who
          pass act as if he is invisible. They look right through him.

          Purvis stands in front of the desk. On the right of the desk
          is a plaster death mask of John Dillinger.

          of the war we continue to wage against
          the punks and hoodlums...
          Purvis looks at Hoover. This was the golden boy who Hoover
          came to despise.

<b>          PURVIS
</b>          One thing I learned was that John
          Dillinger was an outlaw and my Adversary.
          But he was no punk. And he was no
          hoodlum.

          is Billie Frechette. She walks with two guards behind her.

</b>
          Billie enters. She's surprised to see Winstead.

<b>          WINSTEAD
</b>          How are you doing, Billie?

<b>          BILLIE
</b>
<b>          (SITS)
</b>          If you come here to ask me more damned
          questions. "Where's this one or that one?
          Did I know Vern Miller? Who did what...?"
          Winstead shakes his head no.

</b>          I didn't come here for you to tell me
          something. I came here to tell you
          something.

<b>          CLOSER: BILLIE
</b>          She sees in Winstead's face, the look of people she grew up
          with. Billie senses none of the cunning of the lawyer/special
          agents she's been dealing with. She leans forward, indicates
          a cigarette out of Winstead's pocket.
          He hands her one and lights it.

<b>          BILLIE
</b>          Okay, Mr. Winstead. What do you got to
          tell me?
          Winstead leans forward.

<b>          BILLIE (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>          (CONTINUOUS)
</b>          They say you're the man who shot him?

<b>          WINSTEAD
</b>          'M'at's right. One of them.

<b>          BILLIE
</b>          6 why are you coming here to see me? To
          see the damage you done?

<b>          WINSTEAD
</b>          Because he asked me to.
          This gets Billie's attention and she looks more closely at
          Winstead.

<b>          WINSTEAD (CONT'D)
</b>          When he went down, he said something. And
          I put my ear next to his mouth and what I
          think he said was this. He said...

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          " .tell Billie for me...Bye Bye
          Blackbird..."
          Billie has to rise and turn away from Winstead so that he
          doesn't see her overcome with emotion. Winstead knows this.
          It is the measure of this man that he respected the privacy
          of John Dillinger's message and only told her.
