</b>          A classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy.
<b>           
</b>          And finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle 
          gray RUMBLES up to the front of the club with a disgruntled 
          Stanley behind 
          the wheel.
<b>           
</b>          A car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut. 
          Stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops 
          open with a SCREECH of 
          metal. Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street.
<b>           
</b>          He smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain 
          at the eyesore-mobile. He pats the hood.

</b>          The car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with a 
          horrible GRINDING. He finally waves over two other car hops who 
          quickly push 
          it off down the street.

</b><b>          ANGLE ON THE STREET
</b><b>           
</b>          Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A 
          horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings 
          into the 
          club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina 
          Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR 
          carrying an umbrella. 
          She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting 
          a losing battle to restrain her decolletage.
<b>           
</b>          Their EYES MEET. Tina pauses as she recognizes him.
<b>           
</b><b>          TINA

<b>           
</b>          Stanley gestures "no problem" and tries to strike a casual pose 
          against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls.
<b>           
</b>          With a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the 
          car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the 
          car hop's tip money... nothing.
<b>           
</b>          He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in. 
          The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of 
<b>          NOXIOUS

</b><b>           
</b><b>          EXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT
</b><b>           
</b>          A forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear 
          Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually 
          pulls into 
          sight on the dark rain-slick street.
<b>           
</b><b>          INT. CAR
</b><b>           
</b>          Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine 
          starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies.
<b>           
</b><b>          EXT. BRIDGE
</b><b>           
</b>          Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. 
          Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely 
          to restart the 
          engine.
<b>           
</b>          Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a 
          SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly 
          falls off with a 
          resounding CLUNK.
<b>           
</b>          Beat.
<b>           
</b>          The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's 
          side door CLATTERS to the ground.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless 
          metal... his mind a complete blank.
<b>           
</b>          He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water 
          swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy 
          sweeps over 
          him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it 
          drops down... down to the river below.
<b>           
</b>          Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating 
          along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY (CONT.)

</b>          Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge. 
          He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and 
<b>          HURRIES 
</b>          as fast as he can.
<b>           
</b>          CAMERA DOLLIES with Stanley as he scrambles down the slope; a 
          black cat YOWLS as it races past him. He steps on and shatters a 
          discarded mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans 
          against the bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch 
          the body as it floats by.
<b>           
</b><b>          CLOSER - BODY
</b><b>           
</b>          As Stanley grabs it, the "body" falls to pieces... revealing that 
          it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some floating bits 
          of garbage all 
          clinging to the "head": an old wooden Mask.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley shakes his head in disgust... some lifesaver.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic 
          symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie 
          empty eye holes.
<b>           
</b>          The faintest sound of a haunting "Mask SFX Theme" rises as 
          Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside... slowly 
          bringing it 
          closer and closer to his face. The surface of the Mask begins to 
<b>          SHIMMER.
</b><b>           
</b>          But then... RIBET! A frog jumps out of it, right into Stanley's 
          face. Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river 
          bottom.
<b>           
</b>          Suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down from the bridge and an 
          amplified voice calls out from a squad car.
<b>           
</b><b>          POLICEMAN
</b>          Hey, you! What are you doing down
          there?
<b>

          answer.
<b>

</b>          The black and white pulls away and Stanley starts across the 
          empty street.

</b>          Stanley turns.
<b>           
</b>          A razor-cut DEATH'S HEAD PUNKER hops down from a fire escape in a 
          darkened alleyway.

</b>          You a cop or something?
<b>           
</b>          A half dozen other DEATH'S HEADS appear out of the shadows all 
          decked out in nipple chains, tattoos and other self-mutilation-
<b>          AS-FASHION 
</b>          oddments.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Uh... no. They just gave me a
          lift.
<b>

          that before. How about you boys?
<b>           
</b>          The other Death's Heads pipe up with "Not Me," "Nope," "Pretty 
          special," etc. as they slowly surround Stanley.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Alright, you guys. It's been a
          tough night. I haven't got any
          money. I haven't got a car. All
          I have is this and you're
          welcome to it.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley tosses Death's Head #1 the Mask.
<b>           
</b>          He briefly inspects the funky looking antique, still slick with 
          river slime, then tosses it back. He approaches Stanley.
<b>           
</b><b>          DEATH'S HEAD
</b>          Hey, man. You got us all wrong.
          We don't want any trouble. I was
          just going to ask you for the
          time. That's all. You got the
          time?
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Uh... yeah.
<b>           
</b>          As Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's 
          Head flicks out a butterfly knife. With a FLASH of steel, he 
          slices straight 
          through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch.
<b>           
</b><b>          DEATH'S HEAD
</b>          (holding up his prize)
          See, I only wanted the time! Heh,
          he, heh...
<b>           
</b>          All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head 
          #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across 
          to #3 and 
          so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more 
          violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally 
          breaks free and 
          scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness. He 
          fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the Death's 
          Heads roar with 
          laughter.

</b><b>          THE BEDROOM
</b><b>

</b><b>          DR. NEUMAN
</b>          That's correct. The truth is we
          all wear masks, metaphorically
          speaking. We repress the Id...
          our darkest desires and hide
          behind a more socially acceptable

          cope with the frustrations of our

<b>           
</b>          Stanley's only half listening though the open bathroom door as he 
          brushes his teeth.

</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Think I'm repressed, Milo?

</b>          No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
<b>           
</b>          As he buttons up his P.J.s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing 
          at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table. A 
<b>          SUBTLE 
</b>          SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off 
          the bed.
<b>           
</b>          We now begin to hear the "Mask Theme"... echoes of the POUNDING 
          Viking drums... growing louder. Haunting whispery VOICES seem to 
          call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside. He picks up 
          the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers 
          across the time 
          work wood. The music builds...
<b>           
</b>          He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask 
          to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.
<b>           
</b>          For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over 
          Stanley's head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.
<b>           
</b>          Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY (CONT.)
</b>          Whoa.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror. 
          Everything's status quo. It must have been his imagination.

</b><b>          STANLEY (CONT.)
</b>          Naw...
<b>           
</b>          He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time. Milo dives under 
          the bed as...
<b>           
</b><b>          AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS:
</b><b>           
</b>          RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around 
          Stanley's head - locking the Mask in place.
<b>           
</b>          STANLEY'S PAJAMAS magically reweave themselves... growing in all 
          directions.
<b>           
</b>          HIS HEAD THROBS AND EXPANDS, turning lime green as it unites with 
          the Mask.
<b>           
</b>          STANLEY GRABS HIS HEAD - His body begins to move uncontrollably.
<b>           
</b>          Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope. The SFX get loonier 
          and loonier as he becomes...
<b>           
</b>          A HUMAN TORNADO. Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his 
          voice jumps one, two, five octaves.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee...
<b>           
</b>          A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The 
          whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise 
<b>          FROM 
</b>          the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing...
<b>           
</b><b>          THE MASK CREATURE
</b><b>           
</b>          He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley 
          material of Stanley's pajamas.
<b>           
</b>          The head is no longer Stanley's. It's large, bald and bright 
          green. The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief. The nose is small, 
          bony and beaked. 
          The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks 
          into a learning grin.
<b>           
</b>          The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether 
          unhuman. In fact, there's something downright charming about him.
<b>           
</b>          The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees.
<b>           
</b><b>          THE MASK
</b>          S-s-s-nazzy!
<b>

</b><b>          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>           
</b>          Trying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the

          the Mask steps 
          with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT "A" with it's little "Quiet 
          Please" sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making the "SHUSH" 
          sign.
<b>           
</b>          Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of 
          Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY/MASK
</b>          O, jeepers--!
<b>           
</b>          Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every 
          time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his 
          pocket and 
          starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. 
          Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but 
          those bells just keep 
          ringing.
<b>           
</b>          The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers 
          into the floor and reverberates through the building like 
<b>          THUNDERBOLTS.
</b><b>           
</b>          The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out 
          covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look 
          at the Mask 
          with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and 
          SCREAMS bloody murder.
<b>           
</b>          The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and 
          his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror.
<b>           
</b>          Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she 
          appears cocking an enormous shotgun.

          laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.
<b>           
</b>          The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast 
          away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH.

          turns a 
          corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears down 
          the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body.
<b>           
</b>          He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself 
          off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and 
          straightens his 
          zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve.

          a wild special

</b>          beneath his legs, SNAPS her back into midair, SPINS her like a 
          baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat.

<b>           
</b>          As the band bangs out the final bars of the tune, the Mask

          body.

          Mask's tie and inspects it closely... It's the same fabric 
          Kellaway saw Stalney 
          wearing that morning.

</b><b>          EXT. CLUB

</b>          Kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina. Flattened 
          into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the 
          Mask. The eyes 
          follow Kellaway as he speaks to TWO COPS guarding the door.
<b>

</b>          Kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket.
<b>           
</b><b>          KELLAWAY
</b>          And if he's not, I got a
          feeling I know where to find him.
<b>           
</b>          As Kellaway heads for his car, the Mask slips out of the poster 
          (still flat as a pancake), slides along the wall behind 
          unsuspecting policemen 
          and around the corner to safety.

          I'm not exactly sure who I am

          to find out. If you really had
          any faith in yourself, you

</b>          That last bit stung, and Stanley knows it. A shadow falls over

          leaves all 
          around her.
<b>           
</b>          The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory

          out he romances 
          Tina in a deep syrupy French voice.

</b><b>          INT. NEWS SHIPPING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>           
</b>          Stanley and Peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast 
          shadowy shipping room. In the b.g., a huge machine spews out 
          hundreds of 
          newspapers on an assembly line. Everything's mechanized: 
          printing, folding, wrapping.
<b>           
</b>          Peggy hands Stanley a cup of coffee. He's a complete wreck, 
          clothes disheveled, rings under his eyes.
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY
</b>          I saw it. I saw the whole thing.
          What's happening to you, Stanley?
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          It's crazy... I've lost all
          control. When I put on this mask
          I can do anything... be anything,
          but it's ruining my life.
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY
</b>          Stanley, I don't know what's
          happening to you, but I do know
          this. That letter you sent my
          column was from a guy with more
          guts and heart than any of the
          creeps I've met in Edge City.
          Whatever this mask is, you don't
          need it. You... Stanley Ipkiss,
          are already all you ever need to
          be.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean

<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY
</b><b>          (PAUSES)

</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          What?
<b>           
</b>          We now hear a door open and footsteps.
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY

</b>          What took you guys so long? I've
          been vamping here for twenty
          minutes.
<b>           
</b>          Dorian and three of his men stand there with their guns trained 
          on Stanley.
<b>

<b>           
</b>          Sweet Eddy FLICKS open a briefcase lined with cash.
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY (CONT.)
</b>          Right. When he puts on the mask
          he becomes that green thingamajig.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          (still dumbfounded)
          Peggy, what are you doing?
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY
</b>          Sorry, Stanley. You really are
          a great guy, but I just can't lose
          my condo. You know how hard it
          is to find an apartment in this
          city.
<b>           
</b>          Sweet Eddy and a second thug grab Stanley and hang him over the 
          steel maw of the whirring news press.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money
          from the heist?
<b>

<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          Thanks. Now I believe you have
          a pressing engagement.
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY
</b>          Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt
          him!
<b>           
</b>          Dorian toys with the wooden mask, enjoying his control over the 
          situation.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          You're right. Easy boys. One
          thing at a time. Tell me about
          this mask, Ipkiss. How does it
          work?
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          I don't know... You just put it
          on!
<b>           
</b>          The Mask FX theme builds, Dorian raises the mask to his face.
<b>           
</b><b>          SWEET EDDY
</b>          Better be careful, boss.
<b>           
</b>          With a CRACK of thunder a whirlwind of light and power swirls 
          around Dorian's figure. Unlike Stanley's transformation, Dorian's 
          is much more 
          diabolical. He grows and changes within a nimbus of ROARING 
          light. Finally the light dies away and Dorian/Mask rises from a 
          circle of swirling 
          smoke.

</b><b>          C.U. DORIAN/MASK
</b><b>           
</b>          While Stanley was a zoot suited bee-bopper in hyper-drive, 
          Dorian/Mask is more like a hulking evil GENIE, fresh out of the 
          lamp and pissed at 
          the world. His diamond earring and touches of his neuvo-gangster 
          look is still apparent, but his huge grin stretches out like a 
<b>          TYRANNOSAURUS 
</b>          Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power. His voice is 
          a deep inhuman RUMBLE.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          What a rush.
<b>

</b>          I'm better than ever, you idiot.
          Now stop the presses. There'll
          be a new headline tonight.
<b>           
</b>          Sweet Eddy stands there looking disappointed with Ipkiss still 
          held dangling above the churning presses.
<b>           
</b><b>          SWEET EDDY
</b>          But what about him?
<b>           
</b>          Dorian/Mask wheels about and ROARS at Sweet Eddy.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK
</b>          DO AS I SAY! I have other plans
          for Ipkiss. Everything's become
          so clear to me now!
<b>           
</b>          Peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase.
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY
</b>          Ah... excuse me. If you don't
          mind, I'll just take my money and
          be going. You guys make
          yourselves at home.
<b>           
</b>          Dorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK
</b>          Must you go? What a shame. You
          and I could make beautiful
          headlines together.
<b>           
</b>          Peggy removes his arm from her shoulder.
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY
</b>          Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part
          of the deal.
<b>           
</b>          Peggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK
</b>          Of course. You only want what's
          coming to you, don't you?
<b>           
</b>          Peggy whips out a snub-nose .38 out from beneath her coat.
<b>           
</b><b>          PEGGY
</b>          Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't
          born yesterday.

</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK
</b>          Ah... But you might die today!
<b>           
</b>          Dorian throws the switch and the presses CHURN to life. In a 
          flash he snatches Peggy off her feet.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
</b>          A girl like you deserves

</b>          He tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper.
<b>           
</b>          CAMERA BOOMS DOWN as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses' 
          huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and 
          hydraulics to finally ENDFRAME on the chute where the newspapers 
          roll out on a conveyor belt.
<b>           
</b>          Headlines in blood red ink now read: "Reporter Killed in Freak 
          Accident" next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking

          in a silent scream.

<b>

          of a slab of meat.

</b>          Milo pokes his head up out of Stanley's shirt, but Stanley

          what's wrong 
          with this picture as they continue their stiff-legged walk out 
          the door. Doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half-eaten

</b>          Don't let it get away!
<b>           
</b>          Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask. But the canine-creature runs 
          between his legs and CHOMPS DOWN on his butt. The tiny dog picks 
<b>          BIG 
</b>          Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b><b>           
</b>          watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less 
          than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope 
          into a 
<b>          FLAMING VIKING WALL TORCH.
</b><b>           
</b>          Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn.
<b>           
</b><b>          DOG/MASK
</b><b>           
</b>          uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down.
<b>           
</b><b>          SWEET EDDY
</b>          Get him off me!
<b>           
</b>          Dorian raises his Uzi and SPRAYS THE AREA WITH GUNFIRE! Dog/Mask 
          leaps away in the nick of time.
<b>           
</b><b>          ORLANDO
</b>          C'mon! We've got the money.
          Let's get the hell out of here!
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          I gotta have that mask!
<b>           
</b>          Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b><b>           
</b>          burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the 
          detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12
<b>           
</b><b>          IN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES
</b><b>           
</b>          Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of 
          WATER now trickles down on him from above.
<b>           
</b>          Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie 
          laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but...
<b>           
</b><b>          DOG/MASK
</b><b>           
</b>          pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight.
<b>           
</b><b>          VIKING SHIP
</b><b>           
</b>          Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks 
          down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer 
          stops. Tina exhales, 
          relieved, as Stanley unties her.
<b>           
</b><b>          TINA
</b>          (kissing him)
          You did it...
<b>           
</b><b>          C.U. - TIMER
</b><b>           
</b>          as it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0!
<b>           
</b>          A muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards.
<b>           
</b><b>          EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT
</b><b>           
</b>          The two front support pilings BLOW UP.
<b>           
</b><b>          INT. CASINO - SAME TIME
</b><b>           
</b>          The entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to 
          slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Milo! Milo, come!
<b>           
</b>          Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the 
          boat as...
<b>           
</b><b>          THE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP!
</b><b>           
</b>          The entire casino floor drops straight down.
<b>           
</b><b>          THE SHIP SLIDES
</b><b>           
</b>          straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b><b>           
</b>          SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him.
<b>           
</b><b>          EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT
</b><b>           
</b>          The Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in 
          the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water.
<b>           
</b><b>          EXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT
</b><b>           
</b>          It bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog 
          emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables.
<b>           
</b>          They can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect 
          romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces.
<b>           
</b><b>          TINA
</b>          Stanley... we made it. We're
          alive!
<b>           
</b>          Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof!" and leaps into Stanley's arms. 
          Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back 
          into a 
          regular dog.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          I'll take that.
<b>           
</b>          They turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got a 
          gun pointed right at them.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye 
          holes and holds it overboard.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Hold it right there or you'll be
          looking for this on the bottom
          of the harbor.
<b>           
</b>          Dorian stops in his tracks.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          Drop it and I'll kill you all.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          You can have it. But she gets
          to go.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          Fine.
<b>           
</b><b>          TINA
</b>          Go where?
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Swimming. We're still close to
          shore.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          Five seconds, Ipkiss.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Go ahead. Hurry...
<b>           
</b>          Tina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN
</b>          Okay. Put it down. Right over
          there.
<b>           
</b>          Dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table. Stanley starts 
          to put down the mask. But at the last instant -- he tosses it
<b>           
</b><b>          INTO THE PILE OF TNT
</b><b>           
</b>          As Dorian turns to see where it lands, Stanley jumps him. Dorian 
          FIRES but misses. Stanley jumps Dorian -- knocking his gun away.
<b>           
</b>          Dorian falls into one of the WALL TORCHES -- toppling it.
<b>           
</b>          The TWO MEN slug it out as a FIRE STARTS. It burns closer and 
          closer to the dynamite -- the mask in the middle of the pile.
<b>           
</b><b>          IN THE WATER
</b><b>           
</b>          Tina and Milo cling to the floating barrel.
<b>           
</b><b>          TINA
</b>          (sees fire)
          Stanley! The dynamite!
<b>           
</b><b>          BACK ON BOARD
</b><b>           
</b>          Dorian pummels Stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the 
          FIRE SEARS toward the explosives.
<b>           
</b>          But Stanley counters with a solid right that rocks Dorian back. 
          Dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees...
<b>           
</b>          The FIRE licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies.
<b>           
</b>          Dorian lunges for the mask. Stanley jumps overboard. The dynamite 
          explodes!
<b>           
</b><b>          FROM THE WATER
</b><b>           
</b>          Tina and Milo watch as the ship blows up. The fireball burns 
          bright, smoke everywhere.
<b>           
</b><b>          TINA
</b>          ...Stanley?
<b>           
</b>          Beat. Stanley surfaces gasping for breath. Tina pulls him over to 
          the barrel and Milo licks his face.
<b>           
</b>          And then the smoke parts revealing...
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK
</b><b>           
</b>          standing on the remains of the boat. Like Wile E. Coyote, he's 
          charred pitch black, with singed hair and clothes. But like a 
          cartoon -- he just 
          shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome 
          Dorian/Mask glory.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK
</b>          What a BLAST! This mask makes
          me a god!
<b>           
</b>          He picks up the last fizzing, but UNDETONATED STICK OF TNT and 
          laughs.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
</b>          I'm immortal...
<b>           
</b>          He raises his arms and thunders to the heavens. At that moment -- 
          the SUN peaks over the horizon.
<b>           
</b><b>          DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
</b>          Do you hear? I'm immortal!
<b>           
</b>          The sun's rays hit the Mask. In an instant, he transforms back to 
          regular Dorian. The mask pops off Dorian's face -- useless.
<b>           
</b>          Dorian stares dumbfounded at the TNT stick in his hand as it --
<b>           
</b>          KA-BOOM! Dorian is blown to smithereens.
<b>           
</b><b>          EXT. MARINA - DAWN
</b><b>           
</b>          There are cops everywhere. Lt. Kellaway wraps Tina in a dry 
          blanket. Stanley holds out his arms.
<b>           
</b><b>          STANLEY
</b>          Back to jail, Lieutenant?
<b>           
</b><b>          LT. KELLAWAY
</b>          Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up
          for the rest of my life. But the

          Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and
          you're the good guy. So no jail.
          Just a downtown parade at noon.
<b>          (RESIGNED)
</b>          And I've got to be your escort.
<b>           
</b>          Stanley smiles and puts his arms around Tina. They head down the 
          beach. The two young lovers and Milo walk past --
<b>           
</b><b>          CHARLIE SCHUMACHER
</b><b>           
</b>          standing near the crowd of post-party VICTIMS being helped by the 
          POLICE and MEDICAL PERSONNEL. He's still hitting on that 
<b>          STATUESQUE 
</b>          Valkyrie change girl.
<b>           
</b><b>          CHARLIE
</b>          So I deck this thug, grab his gun
          and tell Stanley, "Take cover,
          Buddy. I'll get these folks out
          sae and sound." Y'know
          we should go back to my place so
          I can tell you the rest of the
          story.
<b>           
</b><b>          ANGLE ON SHORELINE
</b><b>           
</b>          Mrs. Peenman is walking along grumbling to herself when she 
          notices the mask floating to shore with some of the wreckage from 
          the boat.
<b>           
</b><b>          MRS. PEENMAN
</b>          Just look at this mess...
<b>           
</b>          She picks it up out of the surf and The Mask FX theme begins to 
          pound in her head.
<b>           
</b>          Back to Charlie and his Valkyrie.
<b>           
</b><b>          CHARLIE
</b>          So what do you say, sweetheart?
          Let's you and me go back to my
          place and scramble some eggs.
<b>           
</b>          Suddenly Mrs. Peenman/Mask ZZZIPS up and sweeps Charlie off his 
          feet. She's the most whacked-out Mask creature yet with a huge 
<b>          GREEN 
</b>          Witch Hazel face and Bride of Frankenstein hair.
<b>           
</b><b>          MRS. PEENMAN/MASK

<b>           
</b>          She gets a grip and squeezes. AHOOGA! AHOOGA! Charlie SCREAMS, 
          ttears himself from her grasp and starts running for his life. 
<b>          CAMERA 
</b>          PANS with Mrs. Peenman as she RICOCHETS after him hooting 
          laughter. We ENDFRAME on Stanley and Tina as they watch the
