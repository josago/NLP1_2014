          Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no
          one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.

<b>

<b>                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
</b>                    This lighter-than-air craft was
                    designed by Muntz himself, and is
                    longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
                    wagons placed end to end.

          Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet
          and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.

<b>                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>                    Never apart from his faithful dogs,
                    Muntz conceived the craft for
                    canine comfort! It's a veritable
                    floating palace in the sky...

<b>          
</b>          An opulent dining room.

                    mechanical canine walker.

</b>          One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a
          second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.

</b>                    And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
                    consider Muntz the bee's knees!
                    And how!

<b>          
</b>          Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature
          "thumbs up" stance.

<b>                              MUNTZ
</b>                    "Adventure is out there!"

          In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.

<b>                               NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>                    But what has Muntz brought back
                    this time?

<b>          
</b>          Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a
          curtained object.

<b>                              MUNTZ
</b>                    Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster
                    of Paradise Falls!

          He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              CROWD
</b>                    Ooh!
          Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.

</b>                    And golly, what a swell monster
                    this is. But what's this?

          Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.

</b>          Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other
          famous explorers.

</b>                    The organization strips Muntz of
                    his membership.

          Carl GASPS.

<b>          
</b>          Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly
          addresses the crowd.

<b>

<b>                              NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>                    Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to
                    Paradise Falls and promises to
                    capture the beast... alive!

<b>          
</b>          In the theater, young Carl smiles.

<b>                              MUNTZ
</b>                    And I will not come back until I do!
          The crowd CHEERS.

<b>          
</b>          Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible
          lifts off.

<b>                                 NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>                    And so the    explorer is off to clear
                    his name.     Bon voyage Charles
                    Muntz, and    good luck capturing the
                    Monster of    Paradise Falls!
          Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.

</b>          ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely
          visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed,
          her overalls are patched and dirty.
          The old house has been transformed into a make-believe
          dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty
          old bicycle.

          She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and
          pins it on Carl.

</b>          A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room.

<b>          
</b>          Carl stands at the door.   He smiles and walks to her bedside.

<b>          
</b>          Ellie pushes her Adventure Book toward him.    She weakly pats
          his cheek and adjusts his tie.

<b>          
</b>          He kisses her on the forehead.

<b>          
</b>          Carl walks into the house, holding a single blue balloon.

          An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES.    An aged hand shuts it off and picks
          up the nearby glasses.

<b>          
</b>          CARL sits alone in his double bed.   He rubs his face. GRUNTS.
          He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES.

<b>          
</b>          He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom
          spokes.

</b>
<b>          INT. CARL'S STAIRCASE - LATER
</b>
          Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the
          staircase. This takes a LONG, LONG time.

<b>          
</b>          Three quarters of the way down, the chair stops.    He bangs
          the armrest and the chair restarts.

          Carl looks in the hall mirror. He puts on his hat and

          Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside.
          The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain.      Carl
          GRUMBLES in frustration.
          Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door
          shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere.

<b>          
</b>          He sits in his porch chair.

<b>          
</b>          Carl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not
          under construction. Machinery and workers circle busily.

<b>          
</b>          Carl walks to the mailbox.    He touches Ellie's faded
          HANDPRINT and smiles.

<b>          
</b>          He looks through the mail.

<b>          
</b>          He sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of
          images of happy old people. Carl scoffs.

<b>                              CARL
</b>                    Hm.

<b>          
</b>          He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER.   He revs it and blasts off the dust.

<b>          
</b>          TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices.

<b>          
</b>          He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking
          on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

<b>          
</b>

<b>          
</b>          Carl walks to his front door.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              CARL

<b>          
</b>          Carl sits in his chair watching TV.

<b>          
</b>          A KNOCK at the door.

</b>
<b>          EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY
</b>

<b>          
</b>          The door opens.
          A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness
          Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash,
          neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every
          piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8.
          Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl.

<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    "Good afternoon. My name is

<b>          
</b>          As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl.

<b>          
</b>          Russell stops... but goes back to reading.

<b>                              RUSSELL

<b>                              CARL

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it.

</b>          Carl opens the door.    Russell stands at attention.

<b>                        (RESIGNED)

<b>                              CARL
</b>                    But skip to the end!

<b>          
</b>          Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except
          for one glaringly empty space.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    See these? These are my Wilderness
                    Explorer badges. You may notice
                    one is missing. It's my Assisting
                    the Elderly badge. If I get it I
                    will become a Senior Wilderness
                    Explorer!
          Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his
          fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.

</b>
<b>          
</b>          This sets Carl's hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain.

<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    It's gonna be great! There's a big

<b>                              CARL

</b>          Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge.
          Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around.
          Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only
          scattered rocks.

          The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,
          flat-topped mountain on which they stand.

<b>          
</b>          Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS.

</b>          The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the

          Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape.
          Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks.

<b>          
</b>          Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light.

<b>

<b>          EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS

          The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal
          cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.

<b>          
</b>          The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a
          sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each
          wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS.

<b>          
</b>          They surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible.
          WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the
          three dogs and escaping in a flash.

<b>          
</b>          The dogs head off in pursuit.
          A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears
          wincing in pain. They whimper and run off.

          A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring

          dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire.

<b>          
</b>          Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg.        He

<b>

                    Only way to get it out of Ethiopia

                    as "dental equipment!"

          of the bones.

<b>

<b>          
</b>          Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.     Carl
          and Russell run toward him.

<b>          
</b>          The cave leads to a steep incline.      The dogs are getting
          closer.
          There's no choice but to JUMP.

<b>          
</b>          The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell
          to leap down the incline, like astronauts.

<b>                              DUG
</b>                    Go toward the light, master!
          Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.

<b>          
</b>          The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts
          Carl and Russell on her back.
          She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her.
          Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.

<b>          
</b>          BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the
          ceiling. The house lowers.

<b>          
</b>          Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the
          house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto
          the ground.

<b>                                 CARL
</b>                    Russell!

<b>          
</b>          Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels.
          Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 CARL
</b>                    Get back!!
          Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains
          down! The dogs stop short.

<b>          
</b>          Carl looks back as the bird keeps running.      Dug is up on the
          canyon wall. He caused the avalanche!

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              DUG
</b>                    Go on Master!       I will stop the
                    dogs!
          Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                        72.

<b>          
</b>          The dogs run around Dug.

<b>          
</b>          Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.

<b>          
</b>          The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.    She
          rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.

<b>          
</b>          The bird jumps from rock spire to spire.   Russell swings back
          and forth wildly in the air.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    Help! Help!

<b>          
</b>          Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

<b>                              CARL
</b>                    Gimme your hand!
          Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl
          PULLS him back onto the bird.
          Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time
          to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds
          100 feet below.

<b>          
</b>          Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    Hang on to Kevin!

<b>          
</b>          Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.

<b>          
</b>          Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries
          them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but
          is kicked loose and falls into the river below.

<b>          
</b>          Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.     The dogs
          are stuck on the other side.
          Carl painfully gets up.    He looks up at his house.   It's
          still intact.

<b>          
</b>          He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.

<b>                              RUSSELL (O.S.)
</b>                    Kevin!

<b>          
</b>          The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back
          to the ground. Russell rushes to her side.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                     73.
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.   She
          can't stand.

<b>          
</b>          Russell applies a bandage.

<b>          
</b>          From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call.
          Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't.

<b>          
</b>          Russell runs to her side.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              RUSSELL

                    She's hurt real bad. Can't we help
                    her get home?

<b>          
</b>          Carl looks at the bird's wounds.   He looks to the rock maze,
          then to his house.
          He knows the right thing to do.    And he hates himself for it.

<b>                               CARL
</b>                    Alright.   But we've got to hurry.

<b>

<b>          
</b>          DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on

</b>
<b>                                                                     74.

<b>

<b>          
</b>          Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.

<b>          
</b>          Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.

</b>
<b>                              CARL

          Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house
          from behind a tree canopy.

<b>                              CARL
</b>                    This is crazy. I finally meet my
                    childhood hero and he's trying to
                    kill us! What a joke.

<b>                              DUG
</b>                    Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel

                    forgot to store acorns for winter
                    and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny
                    because the squirrel gets dead.
          They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.

</b>                    Careful Russell.
          The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the
          porch.

<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    You okay, Kevin?
          Kevin goes back to sleep.    Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
                    The wilderness isn't quite what I
                    expected.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                               CARL

<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's
                    not how they made it sound in my

<b>                              CARL
</b>                    Hmm, get used to that, kid.

</b>
<b>                                                                    75.

</b>
<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    My dad made it sound so easy. He's
                    really good at camping, and how to
                    make fire from rocks and stuff. He
                    used to come to all my Sweatlodge
                    meetings.

<b>          
</b>          Russell smiles at the thought.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    And afterwards we'd go get ice
                    cream at Fentons. I always get
                    chocolate and he gets butter-
                    brickle. Then we'd sit on this one
                    curb, right outside, and I'll count
                    all the blue cars and he counts all
                    the red ones, and whoever gets the
                    most, wins. I like that curb.
          He looks up at Carl.

<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    That might sound boring, but I

                    I remember the most.
          They walk in silence.   Carl understands.

<b>          
</b>          The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance.    Kevin CALLS BACK.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                              RUSSELL
</b>                    Look, there it is!

<b>          
</b>          Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by.   He tries to run
          but is pulled back by his tether.

<b>          
</b>          LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.

<b>                              CARL
</b>                    Hold on Russell, stand still!

<b>          
</b>          Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house.
          Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward
          the labyrinth entrance.

<b>          
</b>          Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies.   She runs
          off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

</b>
<b>                              CARL

<b>          
</b>          Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce

</b>          A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT.

<b>          
</b>          Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.     Beside them,

</b>          Muntz hurls a lit lantern.      Flames burst up beneath the house.

<b>

<b>

          landscape.

<b>          
</b>          Russell's harness drags along side, empty.

          Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.

<b>          
</b>          Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing.    Next to him stands
          the real house, just like Ellie wanted.

<b>                                RUSSELL (O.S.)
</b>                    Here.

          Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess
          from the rough journey.

<b>          
</b>          Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the
          table into position.
          He pushes their two chairs back into their place.

<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>          Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.

<b>          
</b>          Quiet.

<b>          
</b>          Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside.
          Carl surveys the room.

<b>          
</b>          The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him.   He opens it
          and puts Ellie's drawing back.
          He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper
          clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie.
          He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.

<b>          
</b>          Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but
          Ellie never made it.
          He closes the book.   But as he does, Carl sees something he
          hadn't before.

<b>          
</b>          The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.
          A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.
          On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another...
          photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.
          Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw
          adventure in everyday life.

<b>          
</b>          A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in
          their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:

<b>          
</b>
<b>             "THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!
</b>
<b>             LOVE, ELLIE."
</b>          Carl smiles.

<b>          
</b>          He looks over to Ellie's empty chair.   On the arm is
          Russell's sash. Carl picks it up.
          He looks to Ellie's chair.

<b>          
</b>          He crosses his heart.

<b>

</b>                    Russell?

<b>          
</b>          But Russell is nowhere to be seen.

<b>          
</b>          A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating
          off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                               CARL
</b>                    Russell!

<b>          
</b>          Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into
          the sky.

</b>
<b>                              CARL
</b>                    No, Russell! No!
          Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift
          it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons
          have lost too much helium.

<b>          
</b>          Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch.    It lands atop the
          mountain rocks with a thud.

<b>          
</b>          This gives him an idea.

          dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.

<b>          
</b>          Slowly, one corner of the house lifts.   Then another.
          Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch.    It
          teeters... and falls. The house lifts off!

<b>                               CARL
</b>                    Wahhoo!

<b>          
</b>          The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of
          things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side
          atop Paradise Falls.

<b>          
</b>          A bullet blasts through Carl's balloon strings. A third of

          stop it.

<b>          
</b>          Muntz storms toward the house.    Carl holds desperately to the

</b>          Russell and others duck inside and slam the door.

          But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back.

<b>          
</b>          Muntz hangs for a moment... It's thousands of feet from the

          He falls.

          toward the edge.

          Russell is tanned and dirty.   And alone.

                    that... uh...

<b>          
</b>          The Camp Master CLEARS HIS THROAT uncomfortably.   Russell
          looks for his dad in the audience.

<b>                              CARL (O.S.)
</b>                    Excuse me. Pardon me.    Old man

          Carl takes his place next to Russell.

</b>                    Russell, for assisting the elderly,
                    and for performing above and beyond
                    the call of duty, I would like to
                    award you the highest honor I can
                    bestow: The Ellie Badge.

<b>          
</b>          Carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on Russell's sash.
          It's Ellie's GRAPE SODA PIN.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                RUSSELL
</b>                    Wow.

<b>          
</b>          Carl smiles.

<b>          
</b>          They salute each other.      Russell gives Carl a hug.   Carl
          returns it.
          Russell's mom sits in the audience with Dug.     Russell proudly
          shows her the badge.
