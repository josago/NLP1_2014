               Mirrored sunglasses. Chinese. His fingers tap on the table. A
               cockroach scurries past. Ammo belts. A sheathed combat knife the
               size of your arm. .45 automatics in holsters.
<b>               
</b>               The other, dressed in black. An eye-patch. Dangerous. A flash of

</b>               The crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a
               dozen languages.
<b>               
</b>               The salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in
               front of the two men. Then he leans over to...
<b>               
</b>               A VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it
               out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues
               to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom
               into the first glass.
<b>               
</b>               He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and
               bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally,
               he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart
               and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the
               heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third
               glass.
<b>               
</b>               Now the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood
               is milky-green. The heart and liver are red. He places the glasses
               on the table between the two men.
<b>               
</b>               The two men stare at each other, motionless. The crowd continues
               placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats
               above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from
               one end.
<b>               
</b>               The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger,
               sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light
               circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead.
<b>               
</b>               The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes
               slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red
               liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then
               gulps it down.
<b>

               it lands on something black, an eye-patch. Pull back to reveal a
               man with an eye-patch.
<b>               
</b>               The man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused
               between the remaining two glasses. He takes the one filled with
               milky-green blood and downs it fast. The crowd roars.
<b>               
</b>               One glass left. The two men stare at it intently.
<b>               
</b>               The salesman spins the light tube with more force than before. It
               circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally
               stopping on the fat man.
<b>               
</b>               The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at
               the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison.
               His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws
               his hand.
<b>

<b>               
</b>               The man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And
               without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and
               drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops
               them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off.
<b>               
</b>               The two men stand from the table. Take several steps away toward
               the end of the alley. Stand facing each other. Two gunfighters.
<b>               
</b>               Flashes of the two men. A piece of a black military boot. A hand
               positioned over a six-shooter. Mirrored sunglasses. A sweaty,
               trembling lip. And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and
               clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day...

</b>               The draw. It happens in an instant. The alley thunders with
               gunfire. The guns buck and flash. Then silence. The two men stand

               suicide, began to withdraw into her
               virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up
               her own little world in cyberspace and

</b>               In front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and
               sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of
               Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American
               terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a
               gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around
               him.

               embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's
               on a loop. The image disappears.

               then tried to erase them. She missed this
               fragment on the end of her last tape.
               Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR
               master data bank - and then went prowling
               around for innocent blood, someone
               vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely,
               looking for something to believe in.

               exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps
               out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up
               the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the

<b>               
</b>               Plissken spins. He's standing right next to SPINAL, the leader of
               the Black Cowboy Gang. Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black
               duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle. He looks
               just like Charles Barkley.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army
               of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush.
               Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in.

</b><b>               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</b><b>               
</b>               Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl. A huge cross is on
               stage, and the cross is on fire.
<b>               
</b><b>               CLOSER - HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</b><b>               
</b>               A group of white hooded men, the K.K.K., stand in front of the
               burning cross holding a ceremony. Next to the cross on stage, a
               hooded K.K.K. string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken reacts.
<b>               
</b><b>               SPINAL
</b>               Let's take him.
<b>               
</b>               A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others
               quickly race down the hillside. He fires.
<b>               
</b><b>               THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</b><b>               
</b>               A 40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it
               rockets toward the burning cross and - KABLAMMO! A fireball blows
               pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around...
<b>               
</b>               A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from
               the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his
               feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A
               hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are
               overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the
               Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts
               of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it
               starts to rain again.
<b>               
</b>               Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight
               continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and
               jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding
               flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying. As
               he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the
               rain is washing the mud off his body...
<b>               
</b>               AND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is
               washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops.

               them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the
               rain...

</b><b>               
</b>               The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped
               again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the
               distance, the sound of thumping music.
<b>               
</b>

               Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's
               like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs
               celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic.
               Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under
               the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads:
<b>               "SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES",
</b><b>               "SATISFACTION GUARANTEED"

</b>               One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.

</b><b>               CLOSEUP - THE HOOKER
</b><b>               
</b>               Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene
               orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a
               small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the
               air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises.

<b>               
</b>               The caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead
               a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all
               scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired
               hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least
               none that we can see.

               Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large
               glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of
               light and flicking them back into the night...
<b>               
</b>               Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And
               there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear
               and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the
               prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind
               her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along
               with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's
               moved off...
<b>               
</b>               Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos
               ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes,
               Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of
               the cycle, jumps on.

</b><b>               ON THE MOTORCYCLE

</b>               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the
               bike, hops up on the seat.
<b>               
</b>               KAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the
               other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms
               along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan...

<b>               
</b>               Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either
               side of him. One of them swings a chain. Plissken grabs it with
               one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and
               fires! The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to
               the chain.
<b>               
</b>               Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire. He
               turns to see...

</b><b>               PLISSKEN
</b><b>               
</b>               As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain. Plissken
               swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then
               Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The
               Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own
               chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids,
               explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.
<b>               
</b>               Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken. They take
               aim at him with their automatic rifles. Plissken pulls a sudden
               wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the
               back wheel. The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other.
               They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on
               horseback who turns and fires. Plissken ducks and the bullet rips
               through the rear tire. The tire blows and the bike swerves out of
               control. Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the
               saddle.
<b>               
</b><b>               THE HORSE
</b><b>               
</b>               Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for
               control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them
               around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst.
               Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the
               saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head,
               pounding down on a biker. The lasso takes flight and finds it
               mark, the biker's neck. Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the
               end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker.
<b>               
</b><b>               THE BIKE
</b><b>               
</b>               With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off,
               jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.

</b><b>               THE HORSE

               swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up
               to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car
               in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car...

               wrist, flips him over, knocks the machete off into the street,
               smacks Cuervo in the face.

</b>               KAWHAP! Plissken hits the pavement hard. He skids, rolls, and at
               last slams into the edge of the sidewalk. The caravan rumbles away
               down Sunset. The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's
               submachine gun.

</b>               Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng
               of surgical failures. They carry torches. Dressed in tatters.
               Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly.
<b>               
</b>               Rodeo Drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts. The once
               beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles.
               Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice.
<b>               
</b>               Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and
               Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together
               like sculptures in their windowfronts. A giant rift runs down the
               street's center. Acrid smoke rises.
<b>               
</b>               The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is
               anchored in the middle of the street. Surrounding the intersection
               are patients of every size, age, sex.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken looks over, sees another cross being carried up and
               planted right next to his. A beautiful girl is tied to this cross.
               This is TASLIMA, 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess.
               She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an IQ of around

<b>               
</b>               Plissken looks across the street. Our of the ruins of the once
               famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women facialists
               with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings wielding
               knives, saws, horrible-looking carving instruments...

               pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts.
<b>               
</b>               The throng of facialists, patients, interns and nurses surround
               Plissken and Taslima on the crosses. They move back to the
               sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken
               and Taslima is about to begin. The gurneys are wheeled into place
               and set up as large cutting tables. The facialists take their
               positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat.

               of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in
               Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination,
               he's got no lower jaw. Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work
               attached beneath each ear. It never moves. He can actually speak
               through a metal box attached to his windpipe.

               He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before
               him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made
               up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.
<b>

</b>               I've never seen more beautiful specimens.

               body parts will go to those who need them
               the most.
<b>               
</b>               The crowd gumbles.

</b>               Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck.
               With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto
               his tongue, closes his mouth.
<b>               
</b>               The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward
               Plissken.
<b>               
</b><b>               THE DOCTOR
</b>               What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame
               you only have one.
<b>               
</b>               A nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it
               in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face
               to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good
               eye from its socket with his scalpel tips.
<b>               
</b>               FFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart!
<b>               
</b>               WHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He
               freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls
               forward.
<b>               
</b>               The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the
               rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut!
<b>               
</b>               Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other
               hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off
               the step-ladder.
<b>               
</b>               WHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time
               as the doctor hits the pavement.
<b>               
</b>               The patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor
               lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly.
<b>

</b><b>               HIS POV - DOWN THE STREET
</b><b>               
</b>               Comes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken,
               pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone
               street...

</b>               Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives
               chase. They stop at another small alley between two large
               buildings.
<b>

</b>               It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on
               either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75
               foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire.
<b>               
</b><b>               PLISSKEN

<b>               
</b><b>               TASLIMA

<b>               
</b>               The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from
               his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow...
<b>               
</b>               Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window.

</b><b>               
</b>               Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the
               balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting
               hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters -
               "CAA" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are
               wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.
<b>               
</b>               They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.
<b>               
</b><b>               TASLIMA
</b>               Be careful of the bald cats. They live in

</b>               The what?
<b>               
</b>               Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands
               are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw
               dagger toward Plissken's good eye.
<b>               
</b>               Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two
               men.

<b>               
</b>               Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor
               fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts
               three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good
               measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...

</b>               Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails
               rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit.
<b>               
</b>               Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street.

<b>               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b><b>               
</b>               Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the
               sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving
               chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain
               seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and
               run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients
               overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
<b>               
</b>               Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird
               whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It
               gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming
               and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping
               back down the tunnel.
<b>               
</b><b>               FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL
</b><b>               
</b>               An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.
<b>

</b>               Snake - what is it?
<b>               
</b><b>               PLISSKEN
</b>               How the hell am I supposed to know? This
               is your damn city.
<b>               
</b>               Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye -
               floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing
               larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a
               blasting, ringing sound. Music!
<b>               
</b>               It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!
<b>               
</b>               From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.
<b>               
</b>               On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an
               optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music
               blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of
               the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in
               jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat
               is hooked to his belt.
<b>               
</b>               He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the
               music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He
               holds the gun on them.
<b>               
</b>               Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO
               BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off
               the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like
               Los Lobos' lead guitarist.
<b>               
</b><b>               PENDEJO BOB

</b><b>               PLISSKEN
</b>               Which way?
<b>               
</b>               With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken.
               Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight.
               With it, he examines Plissken's face.
<b>               
</b><b>               PENDEJO BOB
</b>               You're Snake Plissken.

</b><b>               TASLIMA
</b>               Yes. Isn't he cool?
<b>               
</b>               There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished.
               Pendejo Bob extends his hand.
<b>               
</b><b>               PENDEJO BOB
</b>               An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
               Pendejo Bob.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and
               footfalls of the patients gets closer...
<b>               
</b><b>               PENDEJO BOB
</b>               Those damn patients are coming back. You'd
               better climb aboard.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo
               Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.
<b>               
</b>
<b>               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
</b><b>               
</b>               The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only
               light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
<b>               
</b><b>               PENDEJO BOB
</b>               I use the eye and the music to scare em

               great. Chased a whole bunch of em right
               off the edge there a few months ago.
<b>               
</b>               He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the
               passage.

</b><b>               INSIDE THE TUNNEL

</b>               Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and
               sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up
               ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL"
<b>               
</b>
<b>               INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>               
</b>               The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control
               center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges
               and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered
               with dust and grime.
<b>               
</b>               Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children,
               all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open
               fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of
               sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade
               launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked
               everywhere.
<b>               
</b>               The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.
<b>

               Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed

<b>               
</b>               Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to
               Plissken.
<b>               
</b><b>               PENDEJO BOB

<b>               
</b>               He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the
               darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other,
               carrying crates of weapons.

</b><b>               
</b>               Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate.
               Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the
               sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in
               heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.
<b>

               trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway. He strides past
               rows of junked cars. A few of them have people inside...
<b>               
</b>               There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old
               in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle. A pickup truck full of old
               illegal aliens packed in like sardines. Someone cooks from a
               barbecue grill. An RV. An old man sits in the opened doorway,
               staring at Plissken as he passes. Two old ladies in housecoats
               stare at him through the windows.
<b>               
</b>               CLICK, CLICK! A sound behind Plissken. He spins, 9mm ready...
<b>               
</b>               It's Taslima, running to catch up with him.
<b>

               do what they'd always done before. During

</b>               Suddenly a shot rings out. Taslima is struck and falls. Plissken
               drops between the cars and crawls over to her.

               Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally,

               filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly,
               illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are
               being fed and cared for by Mescalitos.

               unlocking him from the treadmill.
<b>

</b>               The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with
               machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken
               is hurled in. The door slams shut.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man
               steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.
<b>               
</b><b>               DELGADO

</b>               Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming
               machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his
               wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.
<b>               
</b><b>               PLISSKEN

<b>               
</b>               Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just
               barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...
<b>               
</b>               Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet.
               Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and
               wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA-
<b>               CLANG!
</b><b>               
</b>               Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself
               through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick
               right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the
               machetes CLANKS to the floor...
<b>               
</b>               Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...
<b>               
</b>               WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...
<b>               
</b>               THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at
               it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.

</b>               The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top
               and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by
               Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on
               those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their
               cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal.

</b>               Beat. Beat.
<b>               
</b>               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the
               ground, takes his rifle.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken quickly moves down the dark street after the caravan.

</b>               Cuervo Jones' caravan comes rolling down Manchester, into a vast
               parking lot toward the Forum. Portions of the gigantic sports
               arena have been damaged in the earthquake, but crowds still pour
               into the entrances.

</b>               Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear
               cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door,

</b>               The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy
               hallway.
<b>               
</b>               Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.
<b>               
</b>               Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a
               body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is
               wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.
<b>               
</b>               He moves forward...

               The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the
               other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams. Pipeline is
               in the crowd, enjoying the game...
<b>               
</b>               Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline. The
               whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above
               his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.

               a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're
               watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The

               Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo, dressed in turban-like
               headgear and sunglasses, wearing black capes and carrying old

               out of the seat. Utopia grabs the controls.
<b>               
</b>               The lead helicopter goes wild, lurching and swinging and dropping.
               Plissken and Cuervo are locked in a death grip, hanging on to the
               doorway, one foot in, one foot out.
<b>

               Plissken's arm wrapped around the dangling right skid.

</b>               The lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings, Plissken and
               Cuervo suspended below, struggling to the death, whipped back and
               forth by the helicopter's gyrations.
<b>               
</b>               In the cockpit, Utopia grabs the controls. The ship is shaking,
               swinging like a pendulum. Hershe is hit with gunfire, flops in the
               rear compartment. Map To The Stars Eddie slowly regains
               consciousness, stares in horror at Utopia.

</b>               KA-CRACK! The dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on
               the helicopter above. Plissken and Cuervo Jones stare up, then at
               each other, then both begin pulling themselves up the skid,
               climbing hand over hand, in a desperate race...

               left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the
               San Fernando Sea. Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other. Plissken
               slides away from him, looks up... sees the grappling hook stuck
               into the side of the helicopter...

               prying loose the grappling hook. Cuervo's coming right up behind
               him, reaching for him, a huge knife in his hands. He raises the
               knife - when Map To The Stars Eddie leans out of the cockpit door,
               lowers a gun and aims it right at Cuervo.

</b>               Where's the anti-toxin...?
<b>               
</b><b>               PRESIDENT
</b>               Give me the prototype.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken reaches into his boot, hands it to the President.
<b>               
</b><b>               MALLOY
</b>               Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real
               one.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To
               The Stars Eddie's transistor radio. The President hurls the real
               prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony. Plissken
               glances at it lying on the ground.
<b>               
</b>               Nobody moves. Plissken looks at their faces.
<b>               
</b><b>               PLISSKEN
</b>               Give me the goddamn shot!
<b>               
</b>               Suddenly everyone begins to smirk. A couple cops laugh.
<b>               
</b><b>               MALLOY
</b>               It was all a fake, Plissken.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken stares at him. More laughter.
<b>               
</b><b>               BRAZEN
</b>               You were injected with glucose. There is
               no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going
               to die - at least not from anything we
               gave you.
<b>               
</b><b>               MALLOY
</b>               C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's
               phony, you know that.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken moves toward the President, stops inches away.
<b>               
</b><b>               MALLOY
</b>               Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride,
               and you came through. Not bad for a
               dirtbag like you.
<b>               
</b><b>               PRESIDENT
</b>               You're free, Plissken. But if you even so
               much as break wind on a country road I'll
               crush you like a bug.
<b>               
</b>               The President glares at Plissken, turns, walks away.
<b>               
</b><b>               COP (O.S.)
</b>               Commander...
               (Malloy looks at him)
               Look what we found.
<b>               
</b>               Across the clearing come two policemen dragging Utopia along with
               them. They bring her up in front of Malloy. Utopia glances at
               Plissken.
<b>               
</b><b>               MALLOY
</b>               You didn't finish the mission, Plissken.
               We'll have to do that for you.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken, Malloy and Brazen watch as Utopia is taken away. Finally
               Plissken turns to Malloy.
<b>               
</b><b>               PLISSKEN
</b>               Got a smoke?
<b>               
</b><b>               MALLOY
</b>               You're gonna have to learn to respect the
               law, Snake. The United States is a no-
               smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking,
               do drugs, no women unless you're married,
               no guns, no foul language. It's a brand
               new day for you, Snake.
<b>               
</b><b>               PLISSKEN
</b>               The name's Plissken.
<b>               
</b>               Plissken walks away. Follow his feet as they stop next to the
               prototype lying in the grass...

</b>               Utopia is being strapped into an electric chair by her police
               guards. The guards step back from Utopia. One of them walks over
               to a huge switch on the wall.
