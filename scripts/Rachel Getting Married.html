</b>              KYM, a darkly beautiful girl in her early 20's, is smoking
              furiously on the porch of an URBAN HALFWAY HOUSE. She glances
              impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell
              phone. As she exhales, WE HEAR the rumble of thunder.

<b>          
</b>              Irritated, she crams her cell phone into her bag.
              ROSA a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling
              WALTER, an irate patient who is screeching...

<b>                                  WALTER
</b>                        I want my fucking Zippo now!
              Walter starts yanking at his hair.

                        your lighter because you'll torch

</b>              Kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke but
              gives no signal that she's heard anything. She yanks her cell
              phone out of her bag as...

</b>              Rosa takes two of Kym's several bags. They are oddly matched.
              A Coach tote, a fake Prada, a Gristedes bag, and a World

                           It was a mistake. I'm lucky I
                           didn't get fired. We've discussed
                           this. (She offers her hand) Good
                           luck.

<b>          
</b>              Kym doesn't appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand
              barely... so very, very faintly.
              Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late
              50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. He is
              wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. They hug. Kym
              talks rapidly over his shoulder...

                           you were going to abandon me in
                           rehab. It's 12:30. You guys are
                           half an hour late. I've been
                           standing here with these lunatics.

</b>               Kym and Kieran, having SEX in the cavernous basement. It
               runs practically the length of the house and there are nooks
               and caves everywhere. An ancient sofa, riddled with
               cigarette burns, some futons, dragged down and thrown
               haphazardly in corners, Unicorn posters hideously and
               pornographically defaced, and squat jars of ancient household
               products (Oil of Olay, self tanner) filled with cigarette
               butts offer proof of years of inhabitation.
               LATER -- Kym lights up.

               and shakes her head gently, the gems glimmer and sparkle.

               The INDIAN FEAST contrasts agreeably with the Ukrainian
               visuals. EVOCATIVE BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PROVIDES THE SOUNDTRACK.

                            I've known Sidney most of my life.

                            grandest cliches, even as he
                            breathes fresh life into most of
                            them. He has never, ever "ceased to
                            amaze me," and only in the best of
                            ways. The magnitude of his artistry
                            and his business acumen are matters
                            of public record and delight. He's
                            been a great friend "through thick
                            and thin," and sometimes it's
                            gotten very, very thin -- but he
                            "stood by me" at all times, so it
                            is my privilege and honor to stand
                            by him on this profound occasion...

</b>                            You all look fabulous. During the
                            twenty minutes I was not in the
                            hole for making a shiv out of my
                            toothbrush, I actually did
                            participate in the infamous 12 Step
                            program. 12 Steps. Step-ball-
                            change, step-ball-change. I'm still
                            waiting for the change part.
               Some guests laugh. Sidney grins. Carol, Paul, Rachel, and
               Abby sit silently. Andrew moves in towards his wife.

                            amends.

</b>                            So I spent a lot of time calling up

                            desperately trying to forget. I had
                            to call this one girl who was, I

                            about it. And he had his red socks
                            and he was running around kicking
                            up the leaves. You know in movies

                            around? It was like that. But fun.
                            You know. We were having so much
                            fun. We were leaping around in huge
                            piles of leaves. He buried me. I
                            buried him in a big pile. I was on
                            baby sitting detail. He was
                            pretending he was a train. So he
                            was charging through the leaf pile,
                            making tracks, you know? I was the
                            caboose. And he kept going "Coal,
                            caboose! Coal caboose!" So it's
                            time to go and we're driving home
                            and he's in his car seat still
                            demanding coal, and I couldn't
                            focus and I drove off the bridge.
                            The car went into the lake. I
                            couldn't get him out of his car
                            seat. He drowned.

               child's bowl with Engines and Cabooses all over it. Paul
               turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel.

</b>               It dawns on Kym that she's handed her father Ethan's bowl.
               She is stricken.
               Paul looks to Carol. He seems bewildered. The kitchen falls
               silent and Carol takes Ethan's bowl and places it in the
               sink, out of sight. She leads Paul gently out of the kitchen.

               back in the cupboard and shuts the door. Kym doesn't know

</b>               Abby is in her kitchen preparing tea, dressed in loose-
               fitting yoga-style PJs, hair still wet from her bath. A door
               opens behind her and Kym emerges from the bathroom rubbing
               her hands over her face.

</b>                            In a minute. I need a glass of
                            water.

<b>          
</b>               Abby picks up the tray, leading the way from the kitchen into
               the living room. Trailing behind her, Kym looks around her
               mother's unfamiliar house -- the spaciousness and stark
               modernity of Andrew's house stand in marked contrast to the
               rampant folksy-ness of the Buchman house.

                            I was a crazy drug addict. I stole

               squealing around it. The road forks twenty yards ahead, woods
               in between. Left or right? Kym drives straight ahead,
               careening off the road, smashing down a couple of saplings,
               losing speed, right fender smashing into a big rock --
               AIRBAGS blast up into Kym's face -- airbag deflates, Kym's

               exhales into the Breathalyzer tube, her eyes darting between

</b>               THE CEREMONY -- Guests, some standing, some in white chairs.
               The living room is festooned with wall to wall flowers. A
               canopy of cherry blossoms leads from the living room terrace
               to the opened living room doors. Sidney, looking stunning in
               a dove grey Nehru suit and a lavender pocket square, waits at
               the altar with groomsmen Kieran, Norman Sklear, and Cousin
               Joseph (now wearing full dress U.S. Army uniform)... and

</b>               Kym in her dress with her striped hair, split lip and black
               eye, trying to find her game face. The wedding guests are
               slack-jawed. Mrs. Williams (Sidney's mom) looks like she's
               passing a stone.

               composed and lovely and has the tiniest hint of a bruise on
               her chin.
               The procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns
               to face Rachel and Paul.
               Paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side
               of the house and across the terrace to the living room. She
               glows in her white and gold Sari.

<b>          
</b>               They reach the altar of blossoms. Rachel kisses her dad's
               cheek and he hugs her. Things are set up so that Rachel and
               Sidney stand just inside the living room, facing the
               beautiful backyard.
               Kym reaches for Rachel's bouquet but Rachel has handed it to
               Emma by reflex. Kym tries to cover her gesture.
               Rachel and Sidney join hands.

               triumphant slow dance, whispering punctuated by gusts of
               laughter. Angela Paylin is out there too.
               Little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing
               with OLIVE the Dog.
               Kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed
               by anyone. A wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the
               water, supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper. A couple of
               smaller candles surround the slightly larger one. Kym lights
               the candles, extinguishes the match, gently slides the
               illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool, watches.
               Kym rises and walks towards the house, looking for something.

                            and she just lost one of her
