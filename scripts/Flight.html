</b>                         
          It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL
          ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only
          source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN
</b>                         
          We follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops
          and we watch the knob slowly turn.
                         
          Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope."
          We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the
          pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.
                         
          NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling
          the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage
          table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and
          the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior
          2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.
                         
          She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues
          digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She
          opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt
          foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.
                         
          She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She
          flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks
          better of it and hangs up.

          NICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988
          Toyota Tercel and slams it shut.

          We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on
          "speaker phone" mode. The phone rests on the passenger seat.
          We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on
          the steering wheel. She is exhausted and irritated...

           don't pick up...

</b>                         
          A MAN answers with music in the background..."Yo.." NICOLE
          quickly picks up the phone.

           address. You have some...Okay.
                         
          She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview
          she tries to smile.

          The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey
          clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as
          a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The
          sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.

          Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time
          radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...
                         
          An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and
          gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a
          cell phone starts ringing.
                         
          Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and
          inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his
          40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs
          in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty
          carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP
          snatches up his phone and answers...

          He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a
          clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the
          hotel ice bucket.
                         
          The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes.
                         
          We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect
          crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in...

           I've been up since the crack 'a
           dawn. What check? Tuition? How
           much does it cost to go there?
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is
          puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second,
          hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP
          shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on
          the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.
                         
<b>                          WHIP (CONT'D)

           son because you need a tuition
           check...that's great Deana. I'm
           glad you tracked me down in Orlando
           at 7 in the fucking morning to
           shake me down for money. Does he
           even like the fucking school? No
           I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder

           flight, sit tight 'till I get back
           to Atlanta. How am I a liar?
           What? No, I'll call you.
                         
          WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last
          beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.
                         
<b>                          YOUNG WOMAN

<b>                          WHIP

           third wife if you'd just C'mere.
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively...
                         
<b>                          TRINA
</b>           Whip, don't even joke about that.
           Our flight's at 9, let's hit it.
                         
          TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a
          white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help
          but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away.
                         
          ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock
          anthem...JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright"

          WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's
          been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.

          WHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides
          confidently down the hallway. JOE COCKER continues to wail,
          perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains
          while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper.

          88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of
          mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the
          tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the
          mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual
          walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the
          jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in
          to a puddle.

          NICOLE gets out of her Tercel and slams the door twice before
          it closes. She checks the address on her phone and looks up
          at the enormous mansion.

          NICOLE pushes through the overly tall front door of the
          house. At first glance, it's completely empty, unfurnished.
          A GUY in cargo pants and a baseball hat sleeps sitting up
          against the huge dual staircase that leads to the second
          floor. Random boxes of video equipment are now evident as
          are thick cables that lead to a staircase going down.
                         
          On the staircase she immediately encounters another YOUNG
          CREW GUY holding a tiny lap dog while standing next to a
          NAKED GIRL wearing a Shakespearean Military Helmet. The
          YOUNG CREW GUY holds up the "be quiet" finger to his lips.
                         
          NICOLE quietly makes her way down a few steps, stopping at
          the odd duo. We now hear activity downstairs, music.
          SUDDENLY the YOUNG CREW GUY frantically points at the NAKED

          Whip levels off and maneuvers between the two towering cloud

          Gliding over the fluffy white clouds and through the

          of view, he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice

          dial it, she crumbles to her knees. NICOLE somewhat controls
          her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. The little

           The most current information states
           that of the 102 souls on board we
           lost 6. 2 crew members and 4
           passengers. 59 people were treated
           and released. 37 people remain in
           the hospital and 3 of those cases
           are listed as critical.

          HARLING puts his hand on WHIP's forehead in an attempt to
          reassure him. A quiet moment before HARLING slips out.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENING

          WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he
          scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window.
          Thunder RUMBLES.
                         
          WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine
          gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to
          the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that
          HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter
          still in its package.
                         
          Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been
          placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a
          medical cane.

          Wearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty
          hallway with the use of his cane. He checks the quiet
          corridor as he begins his quest...

          The door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other
          side. Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to
          slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP
          walks into the sanctity of the stairwell.

          to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she
          demurely smokes a cigarette.

          WHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a
          pack of smokes from his pocket.

          NICOLE smiles and looks down, awkward around men when she is
          not loaded. She drops her cigarette which we see was barely
          smoked as she maneuvers to leave.

          And they do. They sit in silence as the stairwell fills up
          with smoke. After a long beat...

          Again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the
          sanctity of the fire stairs.

           pretend they don't see me or
           they're drawn to me. It's funny
           because people see me as being
           close to the other side -- they
           feel like I have power or wisdom.
           They think I have the answers. Who
           knows? Maybe I do. Death gives
           you perspective. I lived my life
           so indecisive, in a haze. But now
           that I'm dying everything is so
           clear. It all makes sense somehow.

           June of 2009, which is 18 months
           past code. Their log that should
           clearly state who labeled the blood
           vials and when, is very incomplete.
           And they aren't sure who stored
           them. They used a preservative in
           the vials that has in some cases
           caused blood to ferment and
           register higher in an alcohol test.
           That's what I've done so far. I
           can handle this.

           church. The center of attention is a large, distraught woman
           in her 60's being consoled by what appears to be her son and
           his wife. The WOMAN wears a pin that holds a photo of TRINA.
                         
           WHIP stands at the bottom of the steps, watching folks,
           looking for someone. Suddenly, a 9 year-old BOY stands in
           front of him. The BOY locks eyes with him.

           WHIP looks up to see MARGARET THOMASON walking towards him.
           She has her left arm in a sling underneath her jacket. We

</b>           Like I said, I would lie about
           everything. It didn't matter what
           it was. My whole life had been a
           lie. A series of lies strung
           together by me. And when I drank?
           It was worse. What I came to
           understand was that, my lies were
           killing me. And that remains the
           great fact for me...My lies will
           kill me.

          She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at

          looking for NICOLE. He finds the note and reads it. The
          reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the
          window and stares out at the barn.
                         
          WHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big
          book of AA on the table near where the letter was left. WHIP
          picks it up and throws it across the room. He then grabs the
          back of a chair and tosses it against the wall.
                         
          After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer
          bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall.
          The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came
          within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his
          son.
                         
          We hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE. WHIP
          relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him.

</b>           Because of the turbulence at the
           beginning of the flight and then
           the crash, there was never any
           drink service on the flight. But,
           they found two little vodka bottles
           in the galley trash bin. There was
           no physical evidence found on the
           bottles, no DNA, no finger prints.
           But both the bottles were uncapped
           and empty. The only people who had
           access to those bottles and could
           have drank them were the flight
           crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia
           Satou all had clean tox reports.
           That leaves you and Trina Marquez.
                         
          They let that land. WHIP nods.

          The clock reads "3:43"--
                         
          He sits up and switches on the LIGHT. He rubs his eyes and
          goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there. As
          he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again.
          He goes to investigate.

          The connecting door is unlocked. WHIP arrives and waits. He
          now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the
          frame -- the door swinging in a draft. He looks up to see
          the culprit -- a heating vent. WHIP flips the vent closed.
                         
                         
                         
          Whip now pushes the door with his finger, opening it a few
          inches. Nothing. Darkness.

          open.
                         
          WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window. The
          night is clear. Quiet. Whip takes in the city lights.

          Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a
          church spire. A simple cross is perched on top.
                         
          Whip looks at the church, deep in thought.
                         
          Then suddenly...
                         
          We HEAR A HUM. THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR.
                         
          WHIP turns from the window and scans the room...
                         
          It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life.
<b>           126.

          Whip stares at the gleaming black box. The WHIR of the motor
          seems to get LOUDER. Calling Whip. Beckoning him...
                         
          Whip looks at the fridge. His face is blank, His eyes tell us
          nothing. Then...
                         
          Whip steps toward the box.
                         
          CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door.

          jewels in a chest.
                         
          WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time --
          vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER,

</b>                         
          WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently
          pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the
          fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.
                         
          Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White
          Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists
          the tiny cap back on.
                         
          With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted
          mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.
                         
          WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small
          bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side
          -- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly...

</b>           What was captured on that video is
           that the aircraft was in a
           relatively stable glide just prior
           to the moment of impact.
           However, according to the data we
           retrieved from the cockpit data
           recorders, at exactly 9:34, after
           flying 27 minutes without incident,
           the transponder recorded a loss in
           altitude in excess of 4800 feet per
           minute in what is considered a
           "full pitch nose down" attitude.
           Then at 9:42, according to the data
           recorders, a decision was made to
           invert the aircraft. The NTSB has
           created animated simulation that I
           would like to play at this point.
                         
          ELLEN points to the screen...
                         
          An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow
          it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the
          real audio of the flight crew.
                         
          The animation has a split screen that also shows the
          instruments and printed text of what's being said.
                         
          We hear..."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box"
          "I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What
          are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll
          it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control."
                         
          That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops
          and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in
          progress.
                         
<b>           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
</b>           That audio is tragic and
           compelling. I chose to play that
           part of the cockpit recording to
           highlight a key moment aboard
           flight 227, wherein you say "We're
           gonna roll it, here we go, I've got
           control." You made a very
           conscious decision to invert the
           airplane, to roll the plane upside
           down. Is that correct?

           "By inverting the plane, Captain
           Whitaker arrested the descent and
           allowed the aircraft to level off
           enabling him to glide the aircraft
           away from any populated areas and
           allowing him to execute a forced
           landing in an open field.

          WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still

           suggested as a maintenance

           was never replaced.
                         
           This had 1200 additional hours of

          up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend.
                         
<b>           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
</b>           Our investigators have concluded
           that the jackscrew snapped and the
           elevator was frozen in a fixed
           position, locking the elevator in a
           down position which forced the
           plane into a dive. The loss of the
           elevator was, and I quote our
           report, a "catastrophic event, from
           which recovery was improbable and
           stable flight impossible."
                         
          Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone
          changes as she understands how hard this is for some people
          to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last
          living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.
                         
          It is deathly quiet in the ballroom. Even the PRESS are
          silent.

</b>           Again I quote..."From 9:34 until
           9:42 the piloting decisions made by
           Captain Whitaker were bold and
           remarkable. The fact that Captain
           Whitaker commanded that the
           aircraft stay inverted while
           descending to an extremely low

          A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room. ELLEN
          BLOCK allows this moment to happen.
                         
          WHIP is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected

          A confused MUMBLE rises in the room. Whip's response
          flusters ELLEN for a moment, but she recovers quickly.

          CHARLIE rockets out of his chair.

          CHARLIE looks around for HUGH, no sign. He's vanished.

          Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY. Flash
          bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas
          on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.

           (Whip finally breaks down)
           I'm drunk now, because...
           Because I'm an alcoholic.
                         
          We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound
          in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he
          lets the moments unfold.
                         
          Suddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the
          assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's
          voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.
                         
                         
<b>           WHIP (V.O.)

           if I'd hit my life long limit for
           lies.
                         
          A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words...

<b>                          WHIP
</b>           I could not tell one more lie. And
           maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I
           had just told one more lie? I could
           have walked away from that whole
           mess and kept my wings and my false
           sense of pride and most importantly
           I would have avoided being locked
           up here with all of you nice folks
           for the last 13 months.
                         
          We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he
          is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA
          meeting in a Federal Prison.
                         
<b>                          WHIP (CONT'D)
</b>           It looks like I will serve every
           day of the remaining 4 plus years
           of my sentence. And that's fair.
           I betrayed the public trust. I
           did. That's what the judge
           explained to me. I had betrayed
           the public trust. The FAA took my
           license. And that's fair. The
           chances of me flying again are slim
           to none. And I accept that.

          A large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates
          wearing white jumpsuits. WHIP continues his story.

           written letters to each of the
           families that lost loved ones on my
           flight. Some were able to hear my
           apology, some never will.
           I've also apologized to all the
           people who tried to help me along
           the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't
           listen, like my wife, I mean my ex
           wife...
           (he gets emotional)
           ...and my son. Again, some were
           able to forgive me...some never
           will.

          We hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of
          prison doors shutting. On the sound we cut to...
                         
                         
<b>          INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAY

          We pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small,
          personal photo collage. We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA
          and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front
          of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. We see
          a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman. We ultimately land on a
          photo of NICOLE. We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on
          the porch of the Whitaker Farm.
                         
          We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal. A GUARD comes
          to the front of his cell.
                         
<b>                          GUARD
</b>           Whitaker, you got a visitor.
                         
          WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance
          at the photo of NICOLE.

          WHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed
          courtyard. He checks his watch and looks up.
                         
          WHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor. As he
          gets closer we see a smile break across his face. A smile we
          haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE. We reverse to see...
                         
          WILL -- WHIP's 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD.
