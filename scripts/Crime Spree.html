               Pitch dark. We hear two men speaking FRENCH in hushed voices.
               NOTE: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted.

<b>               EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
               A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large
               homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in
               a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits
               nervously.

<b>               INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
               Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's,
               tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the
               flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places
               the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the
               wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut
               the canvas from the frame.
               Daniel rolls up the canvas.

               Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.

<b>                                       DANIEL
</b>                          Be careful it's...

               Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans
               he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner
               of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.

<b>                                          DANIEL
</b>                          ... hot!

               Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins
               beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief.
               Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He
               turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the
               fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat.
               Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at
               him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.

<b>               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
</b>
               A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it
               and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.

<b>               INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT

               Daniel and Julien move through the darkness.

<b>                                       DANIEL
</b>                          Light your lighter. I can't see
                          anything... and try not to burn down
                          the house!

               Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills
               with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.

<b>                                          OLD MAN'S VOICE
</b>                          Don't move!

               They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in
               his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a
               very long, double-barrel shotgun.
               Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man
               slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down
               the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom.
               Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the
               floor, motionless.

</b>                          He looked dead before he fell.

               The old man groans, then opens his eyes.    He grabs his shotgun.
               Daniel and Julien run to the door.

<b>               
</b>
<b>               EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
               Daniel and Julien run towards the street.

<b>                                       DANIEL
</b>                          Start the car! Start the car!

               Raymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street
               and get in the back seat.
               Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between
               the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck
               between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.

<b>               INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.

<b>                                       JULIEN
</b>                          You didn't think to move the car before
                          we came out!

               Daniel looks out his window and sees...
               DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun
               and heads towards the car.
               Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide
               down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the
               car shatter.

<b>                                       DANIEL
</b>                          Raymond, get us out of here!

               Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man
               opens the breach of the shotgun to reload..
               Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The
               engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake.
               The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes
               and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take
               aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.

               Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives.    Julien finds the
               whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.

                          reinforcement is a much more productive

<b>               EXT. STREET, PARIS -- DAY
</b>
               A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks
               with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.

<b>               
</b>
<b>               INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAY
</b>
               Two large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The
               other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to
               the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter.
               As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring
               at him.

<b>                                        MARCEL

                          I heard you almost got your ass blown
                          off last night. Some thief. A regular
                          black panther.

               Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.

               A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another.     We HEAR a muffled
               GROANING SOUND in the b.g.

                          That it?

               Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk.
               Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art,
               just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes
               several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.

</b>                          Okay.   Now I've got something I want to --

               We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He
               gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal
               a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth
               taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand
               on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.

                          business here.

               The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles
               something.

<b>               EXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY
</b>
               The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is
               SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler,
               dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a
               MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet.
               Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a
               vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the
               cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up.
               Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She
               zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper
               catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the
               cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries
               to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence.
               The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag
               away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the
               bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely
               in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and
               BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets.
               He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when
               he sees...

               HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:    of two police officers moving
               towards him .
               He knows he has no more time.    He takes off running, disappearing
               into the crowd.

               Sami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the

               around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile.

               A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.

               Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A
               beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers
               inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning
               of a sexual act.

               The door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is
               40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a
               rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an
               intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to

               Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he
               comes to RENAUD singing "Des que le vent souffera." He leans back
               in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like

               Zero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud
               song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the
               Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the

               has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but
               loud enough for Zero to hear.

               The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their

               appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another

               lowers it. Lamar looks over the group and grins.

               Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC
               grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a
               very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several
               long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE.
               Behind him are two other rough-looking men.

                          next door and I was wondering if you
                          could make your music a little less loud.

               The Biker takes a sip of his beer.

               Before Raymond can finish his sentence the Biker pours his beer
               over Raymond's head.

               The music continues to pound through the walls. A soggy Raymond
               steps into the room. He walks over to a chair and sits down, his
               head hung down, embarrassed. Marcel is angered by this. He glances
               over to Daniel who subtly nods to him. Marcel leaves the room.

               Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He
               reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves.
               He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat.
               The Biker opens the door.

               Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of
               his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose.
               Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several
               times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room.

               On the last punch the Biker falls backwards crashing through a
               large glass coffee table.

               BIKER #2 moves in behind Marcel and throws a hard punch as Marcel
               turns around. Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers
               fists slams into the hard crown of his skull.

               BIKER #2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles. Marcel knees him
               hard in the groin. BIKER #2 turns to his side and doubles over.
               Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around
               and down on his knees.

               Marcel turns to the third BIKER who is standing by the stereo. He
               is smaller than the others and has seen enough. He quickly turns
               off the power. DEAD QUIET.

               A car drives up. We can only see the outline of an old Chevy
               Impala. Two men get out of the car, leaving the engine running as
               they head for the liquor store.
               Across the street Raymond is checking out a Buick LaSabre, but
               stops when he sees the flashing alarm light on the dashboard. He
               looks across the street and sees the Impala.

               Raphael pistol whips him with his gun and drags him half way over
               the counter, then presses his gun to the old man's head.

               Raymond pushes a button and the hydraulics make the car bounce up
               and down. Sami rolls his eyes as the others get into the car.

                          enough evidence for a warrant to search
                          his house. We got word through a snitch
                          that Zammito was planning on taking
                          Bonanno out.

                          need permission from the other families
                          to do something like that. Our informant
                          told us that Zammito was talking with
                          other bosses and recording their
                          conversations in case they later claimed
                          they weren't involved. Look at these
                          tapes. The guy has recorded every
                          conversation he's had for years.

                          we come out and the contents of the safe
                          is now evidence which you can use against

               leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long. In a blur of
               movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's
               forehead.

               Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard
               nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up
               the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk
               out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs
               after them.

               A beat. The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what
               has transpired in the room.

               Joey "Two Tons", Nicky "The Rake" and three other WISEGUYS enter

               The moment the doors close Sami bolts into the lobby and over to
               the house phones. All of them are being used except one. A MAN
               is just about to lift the receiver when Sami pushes him aside.

               The phone just rings and rings.
               Behind him another elevator has arrived and the wiseguys enter.

               The Wiseguys step out just as the Crew are going through the door
               to the stairwell. The Wiseguys run after them. Joey "Two Tons"
               lags behind.

               The Crew runs down the stairs. Above them the Wiseguys follow.
               Joey "Two Tons" is breathing heavily as he runs down the stairs.

               The door flies open as the Crew runs across the lot.   Sami has
               already started the Impala and is waiting for them.
               A moment later the stairwell door opens and the Wiseguys run out,
               guns blazing.

               The Crew heads for the Impala, shooting behind them as they run.
               Nicky "The Rake"" shoots.

               Zero is hit in the leg. He falls to the ground, then rolls on his
               side behind a parked car. He fights through the pain, props himself
               up and begins to shoot back.

               Two Wiseguys step out to flank Zero. Zero takes aim and shoots
               one. He lines up on the other Wiseguy and pulls the trigger again.
               Click! His gun his empty.

</b>               Daniel and Marcel run towards Zero, firing their guns as fast as
               they can pull the trigger. Marcel takes aim and fires.
               The Wiseguy's dive for cover as Marcel blazes away until his gun
               is empty.

               We hear tires screeching as the Impala backs up.
               The Wiseguys shoot, blowing out the back window.     They move in on
               Marcel and Zero.

               Daniel runs forward with two guns firing at the wiseguys.     As he
               nears Marcel he throws the extra gun to him.
               SLOW MOTION :on the gun as it flies through the air.
               SLOW MOTION: One of the WISEGUYS has almost circle around the car.
               SLOW MOTION: on the gun has it flies through the air.
               REAL TIME -- ON MARCEL: He looks to his left just as the gun
               arrives. It hits him on the forehead and knocks him down.

               Daniel fires a few SHOTS driving the Wiseguy back. He runs over
               and with Marcel's help they grab Zero and help him to the car.
               They dive into the back seat. The car screeches forward and races
               out of the garage.

               Silence. The staircase door opens and an exhausted Joey "Two Tons"
               steps out, gasping for air.

               Small. Filled with cheap furniture. A small kitchenette is off
               to the side of the room. Zero lays on the bed. Daniel uses his
               belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding. Raymond sits at the table
               staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes.
               Marcel is in the kitchenette.

               Zero smiles. Sami enters carrying a shopping bag.      He places it
               on the counter.

               Sami removes the items from the bag. He opens the bottle and hands

               Raymond cuts the pant leg away. Daniel walks over to Marcel who
               is standing over the gas range. Over the flame is a tire wrench,
               the metal tip glowing red hot. Sami opens the bag and removes
               some white bread.

               Daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to
               the bed. Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about
               to happen.

               Zero nods. Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over
               the wound. Zero flinches. Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases
               the belt. Blood flows from the wound. Marcel presses the hot
               poker against the wound. Zero grunts, but does not scream. His
               face contorts violently from the pain.

               Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly. Lamar cocks the hammer back on
               his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead. Hadley drops
               the canvas bag.

               Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. Hadley stands there

               as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then
               stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it.

               off leaving the bag laying on the grass.

               ON HADLEY: He can't believe his luck. He runs over, picks up the
               loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves.

               Hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette. Hadley pops
               the cassette into the VCR. On the screen we see Sami speaking
               into a video camera.

               The color drains from Hadley's face.   Sami reappears, talking into
               the camera again.

</b>                          It's a little arty I know, but it has
                          great content, don't you think? You
                          were so busy looking for a wire you
                          probably didn't even think about a video
                          camera. It was on the statue. Anyway,
                          I've sent a copy of the whole tape to
                          the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll
                          get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take
                          the day off.

               The tape turns to static. Hadley tries to think. He takes the
               VHS tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to
               dial a number. A beat. He thinks better of it, hangs up and uses
               his cell phone.

               The air is thick with cigar smoke. Several GUMBAS hang around the
               bar. Zammito is at his table with Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The
               Rake." DEAN MARTIN "Return To me" plays on the jukebox.
               Outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a
               stop. The door opens and Raphael and ten other very tough-looking
               GANG MEMBERS step inside. The room falls silent, except for Dino
               on the jukebox. Zammito stands up.

               They are right on the edge of having a major disaster. The Dean
               Martin song ends. Dead quiet. Each group watches the other to
               see who's going to make the first move.
               The jukebox selects another record. The needle scratches against
               the vinyl intro. We hear the intro to JERRY VALE singing "Amore
               Scusami".

               member. Another gang member kills him.
               It's a massacre! Bodies drop like flies. The room is so thick
               with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you. Finally it is

               and Nicky "The Rake" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar.
               He sits up, amazed that he is untouched. He gets to his feet and

               The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air.

               BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel,
               Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch,
               tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they
               stare at Bastaldi.

               A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys.   When it passes
               the crew it gone!

               Bastaldi bites his lip nervously.    Bastaldi looks around, but there

               the cardboard box. It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin
               on an electronic device.

               Daniel is now holding small, black device. A yellow light starts
               flashing. He puts his finger on a red button.

               He presses the button.

               A digital counter begins counting backwards. Bastaldi realizes
               that the device is a BOMB. He stares at the numbers quickly speed
               by 8... 7... 6... 5...

</b>
               The houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball, sending pieces of
               wood and metal flying into the air. A thick plume of black smoke
               swirls in the wind.

<b>               EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- AFTERNOON
</b>
               Daniel, Raymond, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero watch the smoldering
               wreckage. Their blank faces show no emotion -- just a sense that
               justice has been done.

</b>                          I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

               Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside. As he peels through
               the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is
               real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size
               as the bills. Everyone turns to Marcel.

               The five of them walk across the bridge.

</b>                          I'm sorry! I was caught up in the
                          excitement of the moment. I should have
                          checked. I made a mistake. I suppose
                          that none of you have ever made a mistake
                          before?

               No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and
               removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.

</b>                          This is great. After everything we've
                          been through we've got eight hundred
                          euros and an autographed baseball.

                          not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!

               Sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag.

                          their anger with you in light of the
                          fact that you're...
                               (something in him

               Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise.     Even Raymond is
               surprised by his outburst.

                          angry... but I'm the one who took the
                          ball and that makes it mine.

               Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away.
               Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard
               and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls
               off the bridge into the river.

               Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag.
               Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration.
               Something catches Daniel's attention.

               DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped
               away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black
               canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns
               the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with
               twelve sunflowers".

               Daniel's jaw drops.   The others notice his stunned expression and
               follow his stare.

               THEIR POV -- of the priceless painting.
               They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward.
               They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them.
               The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They
               reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there,
               watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.
