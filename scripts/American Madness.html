                         business man for thirty-five years. 
                         Two years ago business started falling 
                         off. Today Jones needs money, and if 
                         he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy 
                         and throws nine hundred men out of work. 
                         Answer - unemployment.

                         - is he honest? Yes. Second - is he

</b>                         Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses 
                         to consider our wishes. He refuses an 
                         offer to merge with the New York Trust 
                         - the only thing that will put this 
                         bank on safe ground. He insists upon 
                         running a bank on so flimsy a thing 
                         as . . . as faith!

                         in your life. That I was an outsider. 
                         Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre, 
                         and then we went back to his apartment 
                         afterward for a drink. That's all it 
                         was. I didn't do anything wrong, Tom.
