               A large and very comfortable office over-looking St. Patrick's 
               Cathedral. At the moment the office is filled to bursting 
               with men and women, slumped in chairs, sitting on desks, all 
               of them very tense. Among the crowd of people we note: MURRAY 
               FISHER, a young and very ambitious junior executive and 
               PHYLLIS BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties. 
               She is a lawyer with the agency.

               At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being what 
               you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth. His tie 
               is loosened, he checks his watch every fifteen seconds. 
               Clearly he is very distraught.

               In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style 
               that can best be described as Bloomingdale's. HOLD FOR A

               expression that she is terribly upset. Then, making up her 
               mind, she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase.

               THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HER as she carries it into the bedroom, 
               lays it out on the bed and opens it.

               A moment later Ted opens the door and THELMA PHILLIPS enters. 
               She is a neighbor (Apt. 6-B) and Joanna Kramer's best friend. 
               About four months ago Thelma and her husband Charley were 
               divorced.

               Until then the two families had been very close, the Kramer's 
               son

               (Billy) being about the same age as the Phillips' daughter 
               (Kim).

               With the divorce, however, the Kramers tried to remain friends 
               with both Thelma and Charley and that has caused a certain 
               amount of friction.

               Thelma is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. She dresses 
               well, works out religiously at Jack LaLanne's and goes to a

               What follows is a symphony in incompetence on Ted's part. He

               Ted takes a container of milk, pours it into the bowl so

               Ted looks at his son for a moment, then carefully replaces 
               the detergent that he had originally picked and reaches for 
               the green and yellow kind. They continue on for several steps

               He sits on one of the playground benches, the work he took 
               from the office stacked beside him on the bench. Sitting 
               next to him is a personable-looking man of about Ted's age. 
               He is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest, tie and 
               polished Gucci loafers. We will call him THE SATURDAY FATHER.

               Note: The Saturday Father and his daughter (a pretty young 
               girl of about ten) will appear from time to time throughout 
               the film. He is a divorced father, putting in his time, not 
               giving a shit about the child. The Saturday Father insists 
               on treating Ted as though they were members of the same secret 
               fraternity. And he comes to represent Ted's nightmare of 
               what might happen to him.

                         No, pal. Your mom loves you very 
                         much. The reason she left didn't 
                         have anything to do with you.
                              (pause, this is very

                         and explain. You see the reason your 
                         mom left was because... Well, I guess 
                         it was because I kept trying to make 
                         her into a certain kind of person... 
                         Make her be the way I thought a wife 
                         was supposed to be. Only she wasn't 
                         like that. She was...
                              (smiles to himself)
                         Well, she wasn't like that. And now, 
                         when I think about it, I can see she 
                         tried very hard to be like I wanted 
                         – very hard. And when she couldn't, 
                         then she tried to tell me about it. 
                         Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I 
                         thought that if I was happy, that 
                         meant she was happy too. Only she 
                         wasn't. The truth is, the only reason 
                         she didn't leave a lot sooner was 
                         because she loves you so much. Joanna 
                         stayed until she couldn't stand me 
                         any longer and then she left... But 
                         it wasn't you, pal. It wasn't you.

               Sound: From the street below, the regular six-forty-five

               THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as, eyes closed, he stumbles into 
               the bathroom, pees, and still not remembering to flush the 
               toilet walks into the bedroom and wakes his father. As the 
               child turns and walks toward the kitchen, THE CAMERA HOLDS 
               ON TED. He heaves himself to his feet and, eyes closed, in 
               much the same manner as his son, stumbles into the bathroom. 
               He automatically flushes the toilet without bothering to 
               look, walks into the living room, opens the front door and 
               picks up the paper. As he starts into the kitchen, he meets 
               Billy coming the other way carrying two plates, a doughnut 
               on each.

               THE CAMERA NOW TRACKS WITH BILLY as he walks into the living 
               room, carefully sets the plates on the dining table, crosses 
               to the television set, and turns it on. He returns to the 
               table, and sits down as Ted appears carrying two glasses of 
               orange juice and vitamins. He takes a seat in the chair 
               opposite Billy and opens his paper and starts to read.

               HOLD ON THEM as they sit without talking, eating their 
               breakfast – the only sound, a children's cartoon program 
               coming from the T.V.

               From time to time Ted glances up from his paper to look across 
               at the cartoon.

               HOLD ON THEM as we SEE that they have become roommates in

               THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he walks toward the back room 
               of the restaurant. Several waiters approach and say hello, 
               the piano player looks up and smiles. As he reaches the door 
               to the back room.

               She sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of 
               her.

               She is dressed simply and no longer has a tan. Nevertheless, 
               Joanna is still stunningly beautiful. HOLD ON HER FOR A BEAT

               The waiter appears, carrying a scotch and soda. He sets it 
               down on the table in front of Ted.

               There is a self-conscious pause. From the bar, the piano 
               player begins playing a new song. From Ted and Joanna's 
               reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal 
               to them in the past.

               It is dark outside and the lights are on in the office. From 
               beyond the door, we can hear the sounds of a Christmas office 
               party in full swing.

               The advertising manager. A balding man in his mid-forties, 
               he wears a suit, complete with vest. At the moment he sits 
               behind his desk listening to Ted's spiel, from time to time 
               he glances at the resume on the desk in front of him.

                         from my resume, my experience in 
                         setting up the leisure package concept 
                         means that I've spent a lot of time 
                         working along the same lines as your 
                         multiple buys and your regional 
                         advertising ideas. I know the 
                         pitfalls, but – and this is more 
                         important – I know the potential 
                         revenue for the company inherent in 
                         these programs.

               The large room is crowded with secretaries, junior executives, 
               researchers, editors, ad-men, etc., etc. They all have drinks 
               in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general 
               conviviality going on.

               THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH ACKERMAN as he steps out of his office, 
               closes the door behind him and makes his way across the room 
               to MR. SPENCER, the Advertising Director. At the moment, 
               Spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his 
               hand talking to a very pretty young woman. Ackerman approaches 
               him, whispers something in his ear. Spencer shakes his head 
               and points to his watch. Ackerman says something else and 
               finally, with a look of weary resignation, Spencer excuses 
               himself from the pretty young woman and follows Ackerman 
               back to his office. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM. As Ackerman 
               opens the door to his office, THE CAMERA IS ANGLED so that 
               we can SEE past them, into the office where Ted stands 
               waiting.

               THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they walk to school. Billy is 
               talking a mile a minute, describing in minute detail the 
               plot of an episode of "I Dream of Jeannie." Ted listens 
               intently, then, almost involuntarily, he glances over his 
               shoulder in the direction of the Coffee Shop.

                         listen. He refuses to discuss it in

                         he said I probably couldn't get a 
                         job that would pay enough to hire a

<b>                                     JOANNA
</b>                              (speaking carefully, 
                              with great thought)
                         Yes... Look, during the last five 
                         years we were married, I had... I 
                         was getting more and more... unhappy, 
                         more and more frustrated. I needed 
                         to talk to somebody. I needed to 
                         find out if it was me, if I was going 
                         crazy or what. But every time I turned 
                         to Ted – my ex-husband, he couldn't 
                         handle it. He became very... I don't 
                         know, very threatened. I mean, 
                         whenever I would bring up anything 
                         he would act like it was some kind 
                         of personal attack. Anyway, we became 
                         more and more separate... more and 
                         more isolated from one another. 
                         Finally, I had no other choice, I 
                         had to leave. And because of my ex-
                         husband's attitude – his unwillingness 
                         to deal with my feelings, I had come 
                         to have almost no self-esteem...
                              (with feeling)
                         At the time I left, I sincerely 
                         believed that there was something 
                         wrong with me – that my son would be 
                         better off without me. It was only 
                         when I got to California and started 
                         into therapy I began to realize I 
                         wasn't a terrible person. And that 
                         just because I needed some creative 
                         and emotional outlet other than my 
                         child, that didn't make me unfit to 
                         be a mother.

                         is here. As a mother, I don't want 
                         my child to be separated from his 
                         father.

                         why you are asking for custody?

               There is a pause, then:

<b>                                     JOANNA
</b>                         Because he's my child... Because I 
                         love him. I know I left my son, I 
                         know that's a terrible thing to do. 
                         Believe me, I have to live with that 
                         every day of my life. But just because 
                         I'm a woman, don't I have a right to 
                         the same hopes and dreams as a man? 
                         Don't I have a right to a life of my 
                         own? Is that so awful? Is my pain 
                         any less just because I'm a woman? 
                         Are my feelings any cheaper? I left 
                         my child – I know there is no excuse 
                         for that. But since then, I have 
                         gotten help. I have worked hard to 
                         become a whole human being. I don't 
                         think I should be punished for that. 
                         I don't think my son should be 
                         punished for that. Billy's only six. 
                         He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't 
                         need his father, but he needs me 
                         more. I'm his mother.

               copious notes on a legal pad. Billy sits across from him

                         When Joanna –
                              (to the judge, 
                              correcting himself)
                         – my ex-wife – when she was talking 
                         before about how unhappy she was 
                         during our marriage... Well, I guess 
                         most of what she said was probably 
                         true. There were a lot of things I 
                         didn't understand – a lot of things 
                         I would do different if I could. 
                         Just like I guess there are a lot of 
                         things Joanna wishes she could 
                         change... But we can't. Some things, 
                         once they are done, can't be undone. 
                         Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe 
                         she does. So do I. But the way it 
                         was explained to me, that's not the 
                         issue. The only thing that's supposed 
                         to matter here is what's best for 
                         Billy... When Joanna said why 
                         shouldn't a woman have the same 
                         ambitions as a man, I suppose she's 
                         right. But by the same token what 
                         law is it that says a woman is a 
                         better parent simply by virtue of 
                         her sex? I guess I've had to think a 
                         lot about whatever it is that makes 
                         somebody a good parent: constancy, 
                         patience, understanding... love. 
                         Where is it written that a man has 
                         any less of those qualities than a 
                         woman? Billy has a home with me, 
                         I've tried to make it the best I 
                         could. It's not perfect. I'm not a 
                         perfect parent.

                              something Joanna 
                              said earlier)
                         I don't have enough patience.

               Looking at his father, trying to memorize the older man's 
               face.

               Ted turns, sees his son watching him.

               Billy's bags are packed and stacked neatly in the living

               Nearby, Billy and his father sit, silent, waiting.

               Billy, fighting back tears, nods.

               Ted gets to his feet and starts toward the foyer.

               The lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window. 
               Joanna sits off to one side, wearing sunglasses. She looks 
               up as Ted approaches, a small smile on her face.

               There is a long pause as she looks at Ted, unable to speak.

                         Ted, when we got married it was

</b>                         After I left... when I was in 
                         California, I began to think, what 
                         kind of mother was I that I could 
                         walk out on my own child. It got to 
                         where I couldn't tell anybody about 
                         Billy – I couldn't stand that look 
                         in their faces when I said he wasn't 
                         living with me. Finally it seemed 
                         like the most important thing in the 
                         world to come back here and prove to 
                         Billy and to me and to the world how 
                         much I loved him... And I did... And 
                         I won. Only... it was just another 
                         "should."

                         went through... Something happened. 
                         I guess it doesn't matter how much I 
                         love him, or how much you love him. 
                         I guess it's like you said, the only 
                         thing that counts is what's best for 
                         Billy. I don't know, maybe that's 
                         all love is anyway... Ted, I think 
                         Billy should stay with you...
