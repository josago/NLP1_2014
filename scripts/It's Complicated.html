    champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND

</b><b>
</b>    JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50
    is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described
    by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this
    woman's appearance screams "solid."

</b>    The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks,
    his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his

</b>The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21

</b>    Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER         
    SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the
    trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and        
    has an air of maturity about her.

          Pinot Noir, please. No, you know                      
          what? I'll have a Tanqueray Martini                   
          very dry with a twist.                                
Jane strums the bar top, checks out the room. It's fun being    
in a big city. Her martini arrives, she takes a sip and         
HEARS something very familiar. Jake's laugh. She looks
across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender. He
seems to be alone. Jane waves. Jake notices her and smiles.

</b>Jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next
to Jane.

</b>     The NYU Band plays Pomp and Circumstance as the Graduating
     Class of `09 ENTERS THE FIELD in caps and gowns. All the
     families in the bleachers are on their feet, applauding.

</b>     Jane, in sunglasses, is sobbing, taking photos. Next to her
     are Gabby, Harley and Lauren, hooting, clapping and                
     screaming, "There he is!!!" And next in line is Jake manning
     the video camera, wiping away tears.
<b>
</b>     ON THE FIELD, Luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives
     a broad bow.
<b>
</b>     The Adlers go crazy, especially Jane, who does a finger
     whistle. Jake looks over at Jane with puppy dog eyes. The
     girls notice, assuming their Dad is emotional over the
     ceremony. Jane feels Jake's glare but won't dare look over
     at him. Gabby nudges her Mom to look over at Dad. Jane             
     turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl.

     story about something that happened on stage at graduation.

          works, I do... We look at things,

          okay with that, I like it... but in
          this case, I need to know what you
          really think. Like, I'd like you                   
          to say... Don't do this, it's
          absolutely wrong or go ahead,
          you'll be fine. I actually want to
          be told what to do.

          in some time. I'm thinking,                        
          through this affair, you may learn

          guilt and fear could go away, maybe
          I could let go a little and figure                 
          this out.

                  Yeah, my guess is Flomax is
                  probably the culprit here. It can
                  definitely give you a sudden drop
                  in blood pressure so I suggest you
                  stay off it for a few weeks, which
                  apparently your wife will
                  appreciate.

</b>          Knowing how to be divorced is next

          the years, I've thought that your
          Dad and I weren't quite finished.
          And, as it turns out, we weren't.
          So I went out of my comfort zone,
          which, I found out, if you're
          really honest with yourself, isn't
          all that comforting. So, I
          experimented with a part of myself.

          these years there was still
          something there between us.

</b>                I didn't call you last night                             
                because I wasn't sure you would
                take the call and then I thought
                that could go on for months and...                       
<b>                          ADAM
</b>                -- I would have taken the call.
<b>
</b><b>                          JANE
</b>                Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to
                say these things in person. Adam,
                the man I was seeing was...
<b>
</b><b>                          ADAM
</b>                I think I'm up to speed on that
                part.

</b><b>                    JANE
</b>          I want you to know it didn't last
          long and you're divorced, so maybe
          you understand, when marriages end,
          there's doubts and hurt, and you've
          got kids and sometimes you wonder
          if you did the right thing and when
          the moment presented itself...
<b>
</b><b>                    ADAM
</b>          -- I get it. I could imagine it...I
          could...
<b>
</b><b>                    JANE
</b>          I told him it wasn't going to work
          between us but I guess he didn't
          believe me and unbeknownst to me,
          he showed up at my house yesterday.
          He left Agness and...
<b>
</b><b>                    ADAM
</b>          -- Jane. I actually think I
          understand what happened
          but...uh...you know I'm not as
          macho as I appear and I think it's
          probably best for us not to get any
          more... involved because your
          relationship with Jake isn't really
          done and I know you're saying it
          is, but he's in love with you and
          for everyone's sake, that should
          probably get resolved.
<b>
</b><b>                     JANE
</b>          Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk.
<b>
</b>Adam smiles.
<b>
</b><b>                    JANE
</b>          Please tell me you're not going to
          quit my job and ask Peter to take
          over because then I'll never get to
          see you and...
<b>
</b><b>                    ADAM
</b>          I was thinking of asking Peter to
          step back in.
<b>
</b><b>                    JANE
</b>          Oh... I hope you don't...
<b>

</b>          Thanks.

</b>      Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her
      driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the
      bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard.
<b>
</b>      Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in
      this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a
      sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.
<b>

</b>                I'm sorry.

<b>
</b><b>                             JANE
</b>                Way back.
<b>
</b><b>                          JAKE
</b>                Consider it an all inclusive
                apology. From not being the
                husband you needed to showing up
                nude on your bed last night.
<b>
</b><b>                           JANE

<b>
</b><b>                          JAKE
</b>                That you'd find me irresistible.
<b>
</b>      Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.
<b>
</b><b>                          JAKE
</b>                Never considered the alternative.
<b>
</b><b>                          JANE
</b>                Gotta love that about you.

</b>Oh, man, can't believe I got up to
bat again and blew it.
<b>
</b><b>          JANE
</b>You didn't blow it. We blew it.
We blew it the first time around.
This time... we just should've
known better. Too much has
happened. Too much time has passed.
<b>
</b><b>          JAKE
</b>And you don't think we could make
it right?                                      
<b>          JANE
</b>Does that mean you didn't feel it
was totally right either?                      
<b>          JAKE
</b>Being with you Jane is the best I'm
gonna be.
<b>
</b><b>           JANE
</b>But do you agree that it wasn't
really...?                                     
<b>          JAKE
</b>It was complicated.

</b>Begging for an answer.
<b>
</b><b>          JAKE
</b>I thought it was good.   I wanted it
to be good.

</b><b>          JANE
</b>Guess that's as close as I'm gonna             
get.
<b>
</b><b>          JAKE
</b>Do you always have to be so hard on
me?
<b>
</b><b>           JANE
</b>No.   I don't.
<b>
</b><b>          JAKE
</b>I don't regret giving it another
shot.

<b>

</b>                It may never have happened if I
                wasn't married.
<b>
</b>      Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side       
      by side, as they sway in the breeze.

</b>      It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber
      is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.
<b>
</b>      Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A
      GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift          
      tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to

back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before
someone talks.

          out of the oven.
