       walkie-talkies -- rush to open the door. They pry PETER

       dark glasses. He is very drunk, disheveled and cheerful

       feet.

       sways on the cart, trying to mix a drink for himself --
       he pulls a glass out of one pocket and some ice cubes out
       of another pocket. But he is physically incompetent.

<b>       FEMALE AIDE
</b>       jumps onto the cart and tries to hold him up.   The male
       aide runs alongside the cart.

       through the tunnel.

       Fallow loses his balance and sprays the female aide with
       soda water.
<b>       MALE AIDE
</b>       pulls Fallow off the cart and continues to lead him
       through a dark, red-lit area. Several security guards
       run to meet them. The guards and the aide now escort
       Fallow through the area.

       push them away and lead Fallow into a lighted corridor.

</b>
       and his wife and daughter join the entourage as they head
       for an elevator. The diplomat offers Fallow a pen and a
       book to autograph.

       Fallow misses the pen and falls face down into the
       breasts of the diplomat's daughter. The guards pull him
       into the elevator.

       up and tries to clean him off.

      Sherman and Judy are having drinks with Sherman's FATHER

      Judy's sleeve, asking repeatedly, "But what does he do?
      What does Daddy do?!" To which, Judy replies, "He sells
      bonds." Sherman is, at the same time, searching through
      a newspaper for any news of the accident.

                 would be inexorably tied to mine.

               a journalist. I write for a

               Ruppert High. They're either
               cooperative or life-threatening.

               they have to take you.

                   class and doesn't piss on the

                    you want, you can say nothing at
                    all. You also have the right to
                    an attorney. I mean, for that

                    for an attorney, the state would
                    provide you with one -- free of
                    charge.   If that's what you

                Something very... unexpected is
                happening.

</b>                Of course, darling, but keep
                smiling. My husband is watching me.
                Look at him. He's so pleased with
                himself. He's just closed a new
                deal. A charter business. He's
                going to take Arabs to Mecca on
                airplanes.

      Sherman tries to smile throughout the following. Boris
      smiles and nods -- although he doesn't understand a word
      they're saying.

      guzzling wine as he talks. Peter is bored silly.
<b>                                 ARTHUR
</b>                   ... But the best is just a few
                   weeks ago, one of these jackass
                   pilots, he lands long and the
                   plane goes off the runway. I was
                   there. I was on the plane. We're
                   going into Mecca, see. And the
                   plane is full of Arabs and all these
                   animals -- sheep, goats, chickens.
                   They won't travel without their
                   animals. We had to put plastic
                   in the cabins. You know, they
                   urinate, they defecate...

</b>                   Anyway, the plane goes off the
                   runway and we hit the sand with
                   a hell of a jolt and the right
                   wing tip digs into the sand and
                   the plane skids around in a circle!
                   360 degrees before we stop! We're
                   scared shitless. Panic. And we
                   look into the cabin and there's
                   everybody calm, quiet, they're
                   picking up their luggage and their
                   animals and they're looking out
                   the window at the little fire that
                   started on the wing and they're
                   waiting for the doors to open like
                   nothing happened. And then it
                   dawns on me. They think this is
                   normal!

      Peter tries to laugh with Arthur. But Arthur's coughing
      turns into a spasm. He pushes his head back against
      the banquette. He seems to be humming. And then his
      head drops forward and he slumps against Peter.

                    suffered. But ten million dollars

                    things, Reverend, thank you. I
                    been worried about my clothes for
                    instance. I feel that the
                    presentation of my person should
                    be carefully designed. As a model
                    to black mothers everywhere, I
                    think I should have the right
                    wardrobe. So if you could have
                    Mr. Fox's limousine pick me up in
                    the morning, I could do some
                    shopping.

                    And a new refrigerator.
                    And although I should probably
                    continue to live in that shithole
                    of an apartment at least until
                    after the lawsuit is settled, I
                    would like to start looking now
                    for a co-op in Manhattan -- for me
                    and my son -- something with a view
                    of the river and preferably in a
                    neighborhood that is at least

                   Justice is not the will of the few

                   principles of decency. Decency!

                   or a campaign or a trick or a bid
                   for sympathy. Decency is not the
                   beast that bays for money, power,
                   dominion, position, votes and
                   blood! Decency is what your

                   in your bones! Do I make myself
                   clear! Now go home. Go home now.

                    This is going to make one hell of
                    a story!!

       Sherman looks at him for a moment. Then he lets out a
       screaming war cry and smacks Fallow with the sword.

       falls to the ground.      He looks up.    He smiles.

       pulls the gates shut and slides the sword through the
       door handles, locking the crowd inside the courthouse.
       They pound on the gates as the courtroom guards try to
       hold them back.

<b>                                  SHERMAN

</b>                    I'm alright.   Damn hooligans.
       He walks up to the iron gates. The faces of the demon-
       strators are pressed against it. The Judge shakes a
       tired fist at them. Then he turns to Sherman.
<b>                                 JUDGE
</b>                    And you. You, too. You go home
                    now. And be decent. You hear me?

</b>                    I hear you, Your Honor.

       The Judge shakes his fist at Sherman, too. Then he opens
       the fist and offers his hand to Sherman. Sherman takes
       it. They shake.

       Sherman turns and walks away down the corridors of
       justice. The Judge watches him go. Sherman disappears
       into a great whiteness as we hear:

<b>                               PETER (V.O.)
</b>                 And so we come to the end of our
                 story. Sherman, you see, who
                 started with so much, lost
                 everything. But he gained his
                 soul. Whereas I, you see, who
                 started with so little, gained
                 everything...

       gowns surge toward him, cheering, applauding. A voice
       rings out on a microphone...
