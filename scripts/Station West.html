</b>
               The sky is pure blue, exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus 
               clouds, floating lazily. A single bird sails past. From the 
               sky the CAMERA MOVES TO earth. Here, too, all is tranquil. 
               The trees, bright green in the sunlight, move only to the 
               slight but constant breeze. Now the CAMERA MOVES DOWN, 
               revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside 
               the road. The wagon is at an awkward angle, but upright. It 
               is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it 
               as they tried to reach some forage. Its seat is empty. In 
               the bed of the wagon several sacks lie, bearing the legend:

                       From: Argus Mine - Rock Pass
                       To: U.S. Assay Office
                       San Francisco

               The sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife. The ropes 
               that bound them are cleanly severed. The disorder in the 
               wagon indicates haste. Two horses are hitched to it, munching 
               grass or the high leaves of a tree overhead. All that is odd 
               or unnatural is that the reins have fallen askew and trail 
               the ground.

               Now the CAMERA MOVES AWAY and ALONG tracks made by the wagon 
               when it left the road. ON THE ROAD two horses stand. These 
               are saddled, but riderless. The rifle holsters are empty.

               CAMERA MOVES TO the ground. There on the road lies the rifle. 
               The dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the 
               persistent summery little breeze. From the rifle, the CAMERA 
               MOVES ON A LITTLE and STOPS ABRUPTLY ON the sprawled dead 
               figure of a soldier, then another, face down in the road.

               CLOSE SHOT of the dead soldiers, as the CAMERA HOLDS ON them. 
               Near the hand of one a revolver lies, the fine dust coating 
               it. Dust blowing over the uniforms, as though seeking to 
               hide the shame of a murder. As it blows over their still 
               figures, the SOUND of BIRDS coming over:

<b>               ROCK PASS - NIGHT
</b>
               This is a western mining town of the Eighties that has 
               mushroomed up around a gold strike. On the streets prospectors 
               and miners mingle with merchants. As the CAMERA PICKS UP the 
               scene, a lumber wagon passes, bearing logs, a ten team wagon, 
               its trailer filled with ore from the stamp mills and bearing 
               the legend: ARGUS MINE. A stage coach comes in as we:

<b>               INT. HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
               On the hotel clerk, as he sits behind the desk, playing a 
               guitar and singing pensively the ballad of the story. As he 
               sings, JOHN HAVEN, newly arrived on the stagecoach, walks 
               in, gazes at the clerk with a slight smile, finding the clerk 
               completely indifferent to the arrival of anybody, at last 
               leaves the bag and saunters out.

</b>
<b>               EXT. SALOON - NIGHT
</b>
               As Haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon, a well-
               lighted, plush-looking spot, illumined by kerosene flares. 
               Sticking a pipe in his mouth, Haven saunters in.

<b>               INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - EVENING
</b>
               It is a huge elaborate room, lit by overhead chandeliers. A 
               long mahogany bar runs the length of it. To one side there 
               is a big stove and the gambling tables. Beyond can be seen 
               pool tables in an alcove. To another side, a man grinds away 
               at a piano. A stairway near the end of the bar leads to an 
               upper floor. The place is crowded and noisy with people. 
               Haven saunters towards the dice table, pauses, watches; he 
               is looking the crowd over carefully -- missing no detail of 
               the place or the people in it. When his turn comes, he picks 
               up the dice, bets all over the place -- on the line, on the 
               odds, on the seven, then on the come, the hard way, etc. His 
               point is eight.

</b>                         Eight the hard way! Pay the line!

               Haven bets again, doubling all over the table.

</b>                         Seven a winner.

               Players glance at the newcomer. Prince appears from nowhere, 
               standing behind the stickman, watching. Prince is slender, 
               black-haired, handsome and impassive. Haven throws again. 
               Stellman, an Army officer, watches curiously. There is a 
               little rising murmur as Haven tosses another natural. He 
               does it without enthusiasm or any lost movement. The bettors 
               get down on him. Prince touches the stickman's arm; the man 
               stands aside and Prince takes his place with the stick. Prince 
               tosses the dice back to Haven. Haven's eyes are fixed on 
               him. With a little smile, Haven throws the dice to the next 
               man, picks up his winnings.

<b>                                     HAVEN
</b>                         No, thanks...

               His eyes meet Prince's again and then he turns away, Prince's 
               gaze following him curiously, Stellman looks at Prince.

<b>                                     STELLMAN
</b>                         Know him?

<b>                                     PRINCE
</b>                         No. Why?

<b>                                     STELLMAN
</b>                         He just seems kind of free with that 
                         money.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as still smiling slightly, he heads 
               towards the bar, searching the faces of the crowd as he goes. 
               Two miners are squared off for a fight and Haven, going his 
               way, walks between them, very indifferent, not even glancing 
               back at the SOUND of scuffle behind him.

               AT THE BAR - Haven alone is not watching the fight. All the 
               others have turned to see it; even the barman is busy 
               watching. But Haven's eyes are resting on the figure of a 
               woman now at the piano, singing. Softly, as if to herself 
               and for her own enjoyment. He is near the end of the bar and 
               near the piano, and since no one else listens to her at this 
               moment, she sings, half smiling, directly for him, and then, 
               self-consciously, she stops and turns to sit at a table, as 
               Haven watches her. Behind them the fight is being stopped 
               and Charlie's eyes follow the huge bouncer, Mick Marion, as 
               he drags the offenders out to the door and the street. All 
               is as usual. The bartender is back at work. As Haven turns, 
               he finds that the place beside him is now occupied by the 
               young Lieutenant (Phil Stellman). Haven glances at the 
               uniform, then at the pleasant face of the officer, as the 
               barman comes up.

                         Whiskey -- like you'd pour it for 
                         yourself.

               A girl sidles up to him, blonde, brash and pretty.

                         alone?

</b>                         Not till after the first one.

               He turns his back to her; she gives him a look and saunters 
               off. The barman produces the drinks -- a beer for Stellman, 
               the young officer. The barman folds his arms. Stellman looks 
               at Haven.

<b>                                     STELLMAN

                              gulping it in one 
                              gulp)
                         What kind of whiskey was that?

</b>                         On the bottle it says Rye -- but the 
                         way you take it, I don't see what 
                         difference it makes.

               Haven smiles at him.

<b>                                     HAVEN
</b>                         Another Rye.

               The barman turns to get it. Stellman is still looking at 
               Haven.

<b>                                     STELLMAN

               The barman gives Haven another Rye.

                         don't you join the Army? Three meals 
                         a day, a place to sleep, a nice warm 
                         uniform --

</b>                         It has a little more than that.

</b>                              (deliberately)
                         Yeah, it has one thing more, and 
                         that's what I could never take --

                              stripes)
                         It's got Second-Lieutenants.

               The barman, listening, senses trouble and signals with his 
               eyes to a big bouncer down the bar. The bouncer moves up 
               quietly.

                         didn't buy it -- so why don't you 
                         just beat it?

               They stare at each other for a long second, then Stellman 
               speaks icily:

<b>                                     STELLMAN
</b>                         If I weren't in uniform, I might

                         wouldn't be in a uniform.

               Stellman's jaw tightens; then he turns and exits abruptly. 
               The barman sighs with relief; the bouncer turns away.

               He turns away from the bar, after flipping a coin on to it, 
               while the barman stands there not knowing whether to be angry 
               or philosophical.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as he threads his way through the tables 
               towards the door. His eyes catch sight of the girl who sang 
               at the piano, Charlie. She is sitting at a table with Prince. 
               Prince murmurs to her and she glances at Haven, then looks 
               away again. Haven notes it. As he comes near the table, the 
               blonde who spoke to him at the bar, accosts him again.

               Haven is looking at Charlie. She is checking a stack of coins 
               the blonde has turned in to her. She glances up with a 
               fleeting smile at Haven.

               Their gazes meet and Prince notes it with narrowing eyes. 
               The gaze holds like a spell, and then Charlie's smile comes 
               back, from nowhere.

</b>                         You see -- here everybody fights, 
                         except the Army.

               Haven looks at her, fascinated. She can feel a fascination 
               herself. Now Haven smiles a little.

                         So anyone who doesn't like the Army --

</b>                         I know what you mean, but I'm afraid 
                         I'll have to come back. I like the 
                         way you sing.

               She looks at him in a second's silence. Haven turns and 
               leaves. She watches him go. Prince studies her face, his own 
               grim. A croupier comes up and places a paper before her. She 
               hardly notices it.

</b>                         Okay, Charlie?

               Charlie snaps out of it long enough to initial the paper.

<b>                                     CHARLIE
</b>                         That's his limit.

                         the dice at Ed's table.

               He turns away. Prince sits still, his eyes on Charlie, his 
               slim fingers at an habitual trick, that of idly stacking 
               dice in a little pillar and then picking the pillar aloft by 
               holding the lowest dice pinched between the thumb and 
               forefinger, NOT by the edges, but by the sides. Now he does 
               it as he watches Charlie's face. Her eyes glance again at 
               the disappearing back of Haven. The sense of fascination 
               seems to have gotten her, too. Then she realizes the presence 
               of Prince and his shrewd gaze. She looks at him coolly.

               Prince flips the dice into his palm and rises...

<b>               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT
</b>
               The board sidewalk has given way to a rutty dirt road. Now 
               the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise, 
               the road dark and silent. Haven has emerged from the saloon. 
               He glances up the street. Fifty yards ahead, Stellman is 
               walking slowly. Stellman pauses, shoots a quick glance 
               backwards, then goes on. Haven follows, going leisurely up 
               the street after Stellman.

               ANGLE on a corner as Stellman turns it, pauses and waits. 
               When Haven reaches it, Stellman goes on in silence.

<b>               EXT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               As Stellman reaches it, pauses and glances behind him. Then 
               he rings a bell. Haven comes up and waits in silence, glancing 
               at the dark interior. A woman's face now peers through the 
               door window and then the door opens. Stellman enters quickly 
               and Haven follows.

<b>               INT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               As Stellman and Haven follow Mrs. Caslon to a rear door. 
               Looking around, Haven notes in the shadows a desk and in a 
               corner the big safe. (This room is described in a subsequent 
               scene.) So as to emit the least light, Mrs. Caslon lets 
               Stellman and Haven go through, then quickly follows them and 
               quickly shuts the door.

<b>               INT. MRS. CASLON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               It is remarkably neat and elegant inside. As Haven, glancing 
               around, pauses inside, he finds himself facing a burly 
               uniformed cavalry officer, captain's bars gleaming on the 
               side of his collar. The captain is big and broad and scowling. 
               He is standing by the fireplace and his eyes are boring into 
               Haven's with curiosity and perhaps, suspicion. Stellman steps 
               forward as Haven and the captain are measuring each other.

</b>                         Captain Iles -- the Commanding Officer 
                         of the Post.

               Haven gives a casual nod.

<b>                                     STELLMAN
</b>                         Mr. Haven -- sir.

               Iles looks him up and down. Haven hands him an envelope which 
               he slips into his tunic without removing his gaze from Haven.

<b>                                     ILES

                         I seem to finally get everywhere.

               They eye each other, Iles scowling, Haven thinly smiling. 
               The sense of conflict is already between them.

               Haven nods.

</b>                         It came off beautifully. He picks a 
                         very good fight. In fact, I think 
                         I'm still a little sore at him.

               He sits down. Iles is still studying Haven.

                         orders.

               Haven nods agreeably.

               Iles pulls out a cigar, lights it, sizing Haven up.

               The waiter leaves, as Charlie still regards Haven with a 
               curious interest. Haven is glancing again toward Mick, just 
               as that animal barrels down another whiskey.

               He glances up and a slow smile comes over his face as Mick 
               Marion is seen approaching deliberately and with cold menace. 
               Her eyes follow his, then back to his face.

               Blank-faced and big, Mick arrives at the booth. He stares 
               from Charlie to Haven. Haven looks at him then at Charlie. 
               Charlie watches Haven's face, but the smile remains. It seems 
               to sway her, this little test of expression.

               Haven senses now it is a little game they're playing together 
               on him. His smile remains. He reaches for the bottle, his 
               hand grasping the base of it, just as Mick reaches for it 
               too, clenching the top. Mick lifts at it; Haven's hand holds.

               That does it. Mick wrenches at the bottle, and as he does 
               so, Haven releases his grip. The bottle shoots up. The wine 
               spills over Mick's face and clothes. Infuriated, Mick flings 
               the bottle at Haven, but Haven ducks as he comes out of the 
               chair. The bottle crashes against the wall, and Haven's fist 
               crashes against Mick. The big man grunts and staggers back, 
               but he doesn't drop. As Haven sets himself, he is suddenly 
               pinned from behind by two bouncers. Mick stands still, staring 
               at him, his cut lip bleeding.

               There is a dead silence. At the crap table the dice read 
               seven but no one looks at them, all turning toward the scene. 
               A minor rises and the girl on his lap hits the floor. A drunk 
               steals a drink and no one sees him. (Business with glass) 
               Prince looks on coldly. Mark Bristow, moving up from the 
               dice table, pauses and stares.

               The two bouncers start with Haven toward the door, Mick 
               following. A rear rises and men begin following in their 
               silent wake. Only the guy at the piano keeps on playing: he 
               never stops.

               ANGLE on Charlie as she rises. Bristow and Prince have 
               sauntered over to her as the place empties, leaving only the 
               piano player.

               Prince lets go with one of his rare smiles as he looks 
               admiringly at Charlie. They reach the door. The crowd opens 
               for them a little.

<b>               EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

               As Mick and Haven come out; the crowd makes a noisy clearing. 
               There are bets going down. As soon as the crowd has formed 
               an open space, Haven wheels and smacks Mick across the face 
               hitting with the heel of the hand, so that Mick rocks back 
               almost going down. There is dead silence. Mick sets himself 
               for the Kill, as he peels his coat.

               Bristow is shaking with excitement.

               As they stare at the fight --

               FULL SHOT - fight scene. As Mick is slowly advancing toward 
               Haven. He suddenly swings a haymaker which Haven easily ducks, 
               another and another that Haven evades.

               Mick misses again, fiercely and Haven cracks him one in the 
               midriff. Then steps out fast and waits.

               Mick charges and Haven catches him full in the mouth. It 
               stops Mick, and then Haven socks him again, this time with 
               the butt of his hand -- open palm -- on the nose. Mick is 
               surprised, tasting the blood on his hurt lips.

               ANGLE on Charlie, Mark and Prince, as they watch. Charlie's 
               eyes are fixed with a kind of admiration on Haven. Prince 
               watches without interest. Mark is tense and excited.

</b>                         Stand still and fight.

               As Mick closes again, Haven stops quickly to one side, 
               clipping him behind the ear as he goes by. But this time 
               Mick keeps after Haven and finally connects. It is more of a 
               push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives 
               Haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. As Mick, sensing 
               victory, charges, Haven knows he can't get to his feet in 
               time, so he turns his body and springs at Mick's knees 
               shoulder first. The impact spills Mick on his face; before 
               he can recover, Haven dives on him, hands flat on his own 
               chest and palms turned out. His body crashes heavily, angling 
               across Mick's head, and Haven's savagely pushing hands mash 
               the other man's face into the hard ground. Then he rolls 
               clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. Mick 
               gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. As he 
               closes ponderously in on Haven, his booted foot suddenly 
               shoots out. Haven twists his knee cap away but takes the 
               blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that he 
               almost goes down. And now Mick gets to him. His great arms 
               close around Haven's waist, his hands locked in the small of 
               Haven's back. Haven braces himself against the crushing 
               squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine, 
               but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute 
               power of the other man.

               The sweat stands out on Haven's face as Mick's great strength 
               bends him over farther and farther. He must do something, 
               and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave. 
               Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off 
               the ground. Mick, suddenly finding Haven's full weight pulling 
               him forward, crashes down on top of him. With all the strength 
               left in him, Haven brings his knee to the pit of Mick's 
               stomach; as Mick's hold breaks, Haven rolls clear.

               Now they are both hurt. Haven's ribs and chest are so bruised 
               that it is agony to take a breath. He knows it has to end 
               quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. As Mick tries 
               to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws 
               pile-driver punches to Mick's midsection; as Mick finally 
               lowers his arms to cover his body, Haven shifts his attack 
               to the face. This is not Mick's style of fighting, but as he 
               lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches Haven 
               it is with punishing power. Toe to toe, they slug it out, 
               the belt now unwound and dangling from Mick's fist, both men 
               groggy but both refusing to go down. Finally Mick is helpless 
               to protect himself, but Haven hasn't got power left to knock 
               him off those sturdy legs. Gathering himself, Haven hurls 
               his body shoulder first at Mick's chest but he miscalculates, 
               glances off and falls flat on his face. As he rolls over, 
               dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight has 
               staggered Mick; the big man has taken a step back, and now 
               he starts to walk forward. Dazed and blind with pain, he 
               passes Haven, staggers forward until the tie-rail stops him. 
               There he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head from 
               side to side like a wounded animal.

               The crowd is silent now, waiting. Haven gets to his feet, 
               drunk with weariness. He puts a hand on Mick's shoulder, but 
               hasn't the strength to whirl him around. He braces himself 
               with one hand against the tie-rail, and almost in slow motion 
               pulls Mick around and clips him one last time with his 
               remaining strength. Mick goes down.

                         You can't do this.

               Before he is up he goes down again, unable to make it.

                         Nobody can do this... to me.

               The crowd is transfixed. They can't even cheer. The two 
               bouncers lean over the fallen Mick.

               They pick up Mick as Haven stupidly watches. Then as Haven 
               turns and goes away, swaying and weak, the roar rises. He 
               pushes aside people who try to assist him. They move aside 
               and watch him leave. The crowd goes back in the saloon behind 
               the vanquished Mick...

               ANGLE on Charlie, Bristow and Prince. Prince watches the 
               beaten Mick go by with a smile of contempt. Charlie's eyes 
               are fixed on the vanishing lonely figure of Haven. Mark's 
               eyes are dancing.

                         Give it to him, Prince -- in chips.

               Bristow follows Prince, wiping his forehead. Charlie remains, 
               looking down the now empty street where Haven vanished, a 
               strange soft look in her eyes, a slow smile mounting her 
               lips.

               Orville behind his desk is strumming softly on the guitar, 
               his eyes following Haven as the latter slowly and somewhat 
               painfully walks in and across the lobby. All the way to the 
               desk the clerk watches Haven, strumming softly. Haven pauses 
               and smiles very faintly at him. The clerk puts the guitar 
               aside. There is a coffee pot and cup on the desk.

               He finishes the coffee, turns and starts for his room. Orville 
               tosses two towels on Haven's shoulder as the latter goes. 
               Strumming the guitar again softly, he watches with admiration 
               the retreating form of Haven.

<b>               INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Haven stands in the darkness only lighted by lights of the 
               saloon next door. He stands there looking vaguely out the 
               window, sucking his knuckles absently as he listens to the 
               piano playing. Then he goes wearily to the bed and falls on 
               it gratefully, shutting his eyes, the towels still across 
               his shoulder. There is a moment of silence and then a soft 
               KNOCK at the door. Another KNOCK, and painfully Haven lifts 
               himself on one elbow and drags out his gun. The door opens 
               and Charlie enters. She shuts it behind her and stands looking 
               at him. He lets the gun fall and turns over on his back. 
               Charlie walks across to the bed and stands looking down at 
               him.

                         it to you.

               She puts it on the table beside the bed. Haven's eyes follow 
               her. She sees the towels, takes them to the washstand, soaks 
               them and brings them back and compresses them gently on 
               Haven's bruised face. When she takes the towel away, he pulls 
               himself up a little, propped against the pillow, looking at 
               her curiously. She sits down on the edge of the bed.

               He watches her as she wets the towels again, returns and 
               wraps his hands in them, sitting again on the edge of the 
               bed.

               He is almost asleep. She takes the now unused towel and puts 
               it back in the basin, soaks it, returns with it and tucks it 
               against the side of his face.

               puts the blanket over him and goes quietly out.

                         Mr. Haven, we may not have very much 
                         around here that pleases you, but we 
                         do have a strict post regulation 
                         against brawling in the town. Now 
                         would you like to explain what 
                         happened last night?

                         I came here to return Mrs. Caslon's 
                         call.

               Iles glances sharply at Mrs. Caslon, and then to Haven.

                         Sit down.

               Haven sits, wincing a little. But he beams at Iles, who now 
               picks a book off the table.

               Haven inspects his knuckles.

               Haven goes to the door, gently touching his sore jaw. At the 
               door he turns.

                         And I like it better.

               He smiles and leaves, closing the door as he goes. Iles stands 
               there frozen with rage a moment. Then his face relaxes in a 
               grim smile. He glances at Stellman as he takes a cigar out 
               and bites it off.

               Ernie polishes glasses at the bar. A colored man cleans a

               Haven goes to the stairs. The eyes of the girls follow him.

               Top of the stairs -- as Haven reaches the door, wincing at 
               the climb. He KNOCKS with the heel of his hand, hurts it, 
               then uses his boot toe.

               This is a big corner room, the windows of which look out 
               over the main street. The chairs are big and there is a roll-
               top desk in the corner, a big leather sofa, and on the walls 
               some framed pictures. At a table Prince sits. He has six 
               dice stacked on top of each other and he is lifting the 
               column. Charlie is seated behind the desk smiling. Haven

               Charlie is dressed to go somewhere. She looks much nicer in 
               these clothes than in her show garments of the night. She is 
               listening to Prince who sits in a chair, the inevitable dice 
               in his fingers, two this time. There is a silence except the 
               rattle of the cubes. Then Prince speaks coldly.

               He looks straight at her and she stares back, staring him 
               down at last. As his eyes lower, she turns again to the 
               window.

               She is silent and Prince gets up and walks out. She does not 
               turn. Down in the street she can see Haven riding up in the 
               buggy, and the hard look on her face softens to a smile as 
               Haven climbs out of the buggy. Some people passing stare at 
               him, and whisper together. His fame has spread. He walks 
               inside, smiling a little.

               As Haven enters. There is no play at the tables. Some at the 
               bar. The deaf pianist is pounding the keys softly. Prince 
               has just descended the stairs and gone to the dice table, 
               where he leans, his cold eyes fixed on Haven as the latter 
               goes to the foot of the stairs. At this moment Charlie appears 
               and descends the stairs, adjusting her hat. Haven stares at 
               her with admiration, as she descends, smiling at him.

               Haven has entered in silence, seated himself in a chair. 
               Charlie does not look at him; her face, hard now, looks

               The road is steeper now, and winding.

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The road is cut out of the side of the 
               mountain, leaving a sheer slope on one side, and high, thick 
               trees and brush on the other. As the stage follows a bend in 
               the road, a rider leaps out and grabs the lead horse. The 
               stage lurches crazily and almost overturns as it slows to a 
               stop. Before Haven can free his hands from the reins to go 
               for his gun, two shadowy figures, handkerchiefs helping the 
               darkness mask their faces, have jumped out onto the road 
               ahead and have him covered.

               Haven and Goddard raise their arms. Another bandit, from the 
               hillside, calls out:

               Two shotgun barrels cover the side of the stags. Goddard 
               gets off, hands in air.

                         Get down.

               Haven obeys, to join Goddard in the road, as the bandits 
               converge on the stage. There are five or six of them. Two 
               come up behind Haven and Goddard.

               He gives Goddard a none too gentle shove. Goddard moves on 
               up the road in the darkness.

               A FEW YARDS UP THE ROAD. Mick is waiting by his horse, his 
               gun drawn. We hear the steps of Goddard and the bandit.

               The footsteps halt. Mick aims and fires.

               BY WAGON. There is a half grunt, half groan from Goddard. 
               Haven turns as if to protest and then crumples as a gun fells 
               him.

               CLOSE SHOT - Haven, lying face down on the ground,

               in his last dying moment he was reaching for something. As 
               Haven pulls the hand out, he sees that Goddard's fingers 
               have closed around his wallet. Puzzled, Haven opens the 
               wallet. There is a stiff-backed daguerreotype of his wife, 
               an expired Union Pacific Railroad pass, an express receipt, 
               a souvenir bank-note of the Confederacy, and a small, closely-
               folded piece of paper. Unfolding this, Haven sees the top 
               line:

               "To Whom It May Concern"

               as a legally deputized detective for Wells Fargo Stage and 
               Express Company."

               Haven replaces the papers and lifts Goddard's body, carries 
               it to the stage and places it on the floor. He removes 
               Goddard's gun and shell belt and straps it on, closing the 
               stage door. Haven's face is grim as he studies the ground 
               nearby. The sticky mud shows clearly the new tracks of the 
               bandits' horses. As he starts unhitching one of his horses

               A tiny clearing on a brush-filled knoll, where the remains 
               of a cooking fire are still visible, the ashes scattered 
               over the tamped-down ground. CAMERA PANS OVER TO Haven, on 
               horseback, as he studies the scene. This is where he evidently 
               made camp for the night. He dismounts, sifts the ashes through 
               his fingers to feel their warmth. He cannot be far behind. 
               Then he turns his attention to the trail loading away. 
               Inspection reveals that it divides, one group of fresh tracks 
               heading towards town, another smaller group further into the 
               mountains. He decides to follow the latter. As he mounts and 
               rides off:

               A high spot from which Haven can get a good view. Off in the 
               distance he sees:

               LONG SHOT - FROM his ANGLE. A lone rider, leading a pack 
               horse, barely visible through the timber. He is heading away 
               from him.

               CLOSE SHOT - Haven. He spurs his horse forward.

               FULL SHOT - Haven, in pursuit of the man ahead.

               The bandit, unaware of his pursuer, puts his horse and the 
               gold-laden pack horse through the stream. He comes out into 
               a meadow on the other side.

               PAN SHOT - WITH Haven, as he comes to the stream. Half way 
               across, his horse momentarily loses his footing on the 
               slippery rocks.

               MED. SHOT - bandit. Hearing the noise of Haven's horse, he 
               turns and sees his pursuer, takes a quick shot back at him, 
               then heads for the other side of the meadow where there will 
               be shelter, firing back as he rides.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - Haven. He takes careful and deliberate aim 
               and fires.

               FULL SHOT - FROM Haven's ANGLE. The bandit is almost at the 
               edge of the woods when Haven's shot gets him. He tumbles 
               from the saddle. Haven rides forward, gun ready in case it 
               is a trick.

<b>               EXT. MEADOW - MORNING
</b>
               It is no trick. The bandit is down where he fell. When Haven 
               turns him over, the man's eyes are already glazed. Haven 
               puts his lips close to the dying man's ear.

               The man holds Haven's gaze defiantly and silently as the 
               life goes out of him. Haven lowers him back to the ground, 
               rifles his pocket. There are no papers on him, no 
               identification. He stands up. He has the gold back, but he 
               is no closer to rounding up the whole gang than he was before. 
               Unless -- he is looking at the horses, placidly grazing. He 
               goes up to them, ties up the loose lead reins, draws his 
               belt off, and gives them each a sharp crack on the rump with 
               the buckle. They take off across the meadow at a gallop. 
               Haven lets them get a good start before he mounts his own 
               horse, and follows after them.

               As Haven rides up to the edge of a downslope, gazes over a 
               broad valley, and sees:

               LONG VIEW of a sawmill, nestled in the valley. It comprises 
               several sheds and buildings, with a long rank of stacked 
               logs beside the biggest shed, and all this is serviced by a 
               dirt road along which the two horses canter up to the camp. 
               Haven observes several men come out of the main office and 
               snag the two horses.

               As two men who have snagged the horses now take off the gold 
               bags. In front of the office Pete, the camp boss, Ben and 
               Sam, two tough-looking accomplices, stand watching and 
               glancing up the road down which the horses came. There is a

                         Something's gone wrong, Pete.

               Pete looks thoughtfully at Joe's horse, pats his neck, again

                         this one... go and take a look.

               Two men mount and start away.

               CLOSE SHOT of Haven. As he moves back out of sight. Obviously 
               he can't move into the camp now. Glancing off down the valley 
               he sees in the distance a work wagon approaching. It is still 
               hidden from sight of the sawmill by high ground between. He 
               puts his horse down the slope towards the approaching wagon, 
               at a tangent to the camp.

               watches him go. Ben notes it.

               This is deserted country on the way to town. When the land 
               slopes steeply from the road down into a kind of wash, Haven 
               halts the wagon. He glances around. No sign of life. He takes 
               a hammer and chisel out of the tool box beside the seat, 
               crawls to the crate and prys it open. His cargo is gold. 
               Satisfied, he replaces the pried board, then pushes the crate 
               over the side. It topples down the bank, vanishes in the 
               brush at the bottom of the wash. With one more glance around, 
               Haven resumes his seat in the wagon, puts a match to his 
               pipe, and sends the horses forward at a faster clip.

               she had ignored his reference to Bristow.

               Iles takes it and stares at it. He starts to open it.

               the envelope, tosses the envelope back on the desk.

               his will, comes back from the door and kisses her cheek and 
               then leaves. CAMERA stays on Mrs. Caslon as she watches him 
               go. She smiles slightly, puts the envelope in the safe, and

               almost to silence, except the piano, Cowering, Mark sticks 
               close to Haven.

               At the dice table, Prince stares coldly, hands another man 
               the stick and walks away to the stairway, his eyes seeking 
               Mick Marion who is also staring at Haven. Prince nods to 
               Mick as he goes.

               MED. SHOT at bar -- as Haven and Mark loan against it. Ernie 
               is looking at him curiously; then towards Mick. Haven doesn't 
               follow the glance, but Mark does.

               Ernie gets them. Haven glances at the piano. Mick who had 
               stood there has now vanished. Haven smiles. The drinks arrive.

               Charlie is behind her desk, as Haven walks in. Behind him, 
               sweating now, comes Mark. As the two are in the room the 
               door behind them slams shut. Mick is there with a gun. Prince 
               moves slightly out of a shadow. Mark backs against a wall. 
               Charlie looks up from her fingernails. Haven smiles and 
               glances around. His eyes fix on Mick and the gun.

               Haven, driving a wagon and team of horses, is retracing the 
               road he took back from the sawmill looking for the place 
               where he dumped the bullion.

               CLOSER VIEW of Haven, as he looks for the landmarks. He is 
               whistling softly the tune that Charlie always sings. At last 
               he stops, alights and makes his way down the steep slope, a 
               couple of gunny sacks slung across his shoulder.

               Bottom of the gulley as Haven gets there and locates the 
               crate at rest in a clump of brush. The crate has broken from 
               the fall. Haven loads the buckskin bags of gold into the 
               gunny sack and scrambles back up the slope.

               Side of slope as Haven scrambles to the top, he finds himself 
               looking into a six-shooter held in the unwavering hand of 
               Mrs. Caslon. Her eyes are hard and a grim smile plays at the 
               corners of her mouth.

<b>                                     MRS. CASLON
</b>                         Drop it.

               Haven obeys.

</b>                         Turn around with your hands up.

               Haven turns. She takes his gun and tosses it in the wagon; 
               then glances inside the sack, sees the gold. She backs off a 
               step or two.

               Haven turns to obey. He manages a smile at her.

               She grabs the rein of her own horse, flicks the reins of the 
               wagon team and rides away, leaving Haven on the road, 
               horseless and very much discountenanced. He watches grimly 
               as she rides away. At a distance from him she tosses his gun 
               beside the road.

               Haven rises. He brushes some dust off his coat, smiles thinly 
               at Charlie.

</b>                         I once knew a guy who stole a dime 
                         tip from a lunch counter and parlayed 
                         it into fifty thousand. I might try 
                         that -- but not in two hours.

               She says nothing; her face carved out of ice. Prince smiles 
               thinly. Haven looks at him, shrugs. He hesitates; then pats 
               Charlie's frigid shoulder.

               He turns and walks slowly out. The dirge of the piano follows 
               him. Prince fingers his pistol a little, tempted. At a look 
               from Charlie he puts it away. Haven goes out. Charlie suddenly 
               leaves the tables and goes quickly up the stairs. Prince 
               watches her with a slow smile, picks up Haven's gun and 
               pockets it...

               As Haven leaves the saloon. He pauses, looks around, up at 
               the sky, then down the street. He takes out his pipe and 
               beginning filling it slowly with tobacco, as Mark Bristow 
               comes hurrying across the street.

               MOVING SHOT of Haven as he walks very slowly, filling the 
               pipe, and Mark comes alongside and walks with him. Haven 
               hardly glances at him.

               draining the blood from his face. His voice is a mere whisper.

               He almost glares back at Haven.

               Mark stares at him, then turns abruptly away. He hurries 
               across the street. Haven watches him as he goes off in the 
               direction of Mrs. Caslon. Haven smiles and walks inside the 
               hotel.

               takes off his shoes and coat and lies down on the bed. He 
               gazes towards the wall, thoughtfully. He gets up, goes to 
               the window, opens it softly; then looks out. Down the alley, 
               at the corner, a man is lounging; an ugly looking character, 
               whose eyes watch the alleyway. Haven smiles wryly, goes back 
               to the bed and lies down. The piano music starts next door.

               another grim character stands in silence. Charlie turns as

               is silence. Charlie looks out the window again. Prince fools 
               with the dice. Mick stands stolidly near the door. At last 
               the silence is broken over the ticking of the wall clock.

               Mick goes to the door, opens it; just as Mark arrives a little 
               breathlessly at the door. Mark enters, a little surprised at 
               the door opening for him, glancing back as Mick quietly shuts

               Prince gets up and leaves, and Mick, with a grim smile of 
               anticipation follows. Charlie sits slowly down in the chair. 
               The music comes up the stairs and through the door.

               Haven is lying on the bed, his arms under his head, his eyes 
               on the ceiling. There is a SOUND in the hallway and then a 
               hurried knock at the door. Haven slowly rises, walks to the 
               door. He stands there. The knock SOUNDS again.

               Haven opens the door. Mark enters swiftly, the little gun in 
               his hand. Haven shuts the door and locks it. He turns and 
               faces Mark, now pointing the gun. Without a word Haven walks 
               over to the bed and lies down again, looking at the ceiling. 
               Mark follows him with the gun.

               does, Mark crossing the street, apparently towards his law 
               office. He is in such a hurry that he falls down, crawls a 
               little, gets up, runs. Just as he reaches the office door, 
               just as his hand touches the knob, a shot rings out and he 
               crumples. He still tries, then his hand slips from the knob 
               and he lies there dead. The vacant street is empty with his 
               death. Haven stares. He takes a match from the counter, 
               applies it to his pipe -- then finding the pipe empty, smiles 
               thinly and pockets it

               safety. The sheriff is pretty pleased.

               Haven suddenly drops to his knees. The sheriff almost walks 
               over him. The sheriff stumbles with an oath. Haven grapples 
               with him. Haven snatches his gun, drags him by a headlock to 
               the horse, flings him aside and then mounts. A second later 
               he is away. Shots RING OUT as Mick and Prince and the gunman 
               shoot. Haven rides on, bent low, out of town. The sheriff 
               hides his bulk in the dust as the bullets fly.

               ANGLE from Charlie's office -- as she goes to the window,

               over her face, bitter and grim, yet somehow faintly

               away and is riding hard. Haven watches as Mick arrives and 
               Pete can be seen in conference with him. Other men -- too 
               many -- are gathered around. At last Haven dismounts and 
               makes his way carefully on foot towards the warehouse.

</b>
               As Haven leaves his horse in the brush and trees and then 
               approaches the building. He finds a window in back, breaks 
               it with a stone; then waits tensely to see if the sound has 
               attracted any attention, gun in hand now. It doesn't. Haven 
               replaces the gun in his holster, opens the window and crawls 
               inside.

<b>               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Haven surveys the piles of crates, boxes and equipment. He 
               starts his search methodically and swiftly. Suddenly a shaft 
               of light comes from the front doors opened now by two men. 
               Haven shrinks back, drawing his gun. The men start to enter 
               when Pete's voice is heard.

<b>                                     PETE'S VOICE
</b>                         Where you guys goin'?

</b>                         You want them uniforms out, don't

</b>                         I'll tell you when.

               The men turn and leave. Haven relaxes. He goes back to work, 
               pulls back a big canvas tarpaulin one of the men had 
               approached, and there before him is revealed the army 
               uniforms, stacked in neat piles. He looks and smiles grimly. 
               Outside is the SOUND of horses and more men arriving. Haven 
               goes slowly around the warehouse now, looking for something. 
               At last he finds it: a can of kerosene. He takes it over to 
               the uniforms, pours it liberally on them. At just this moment 
               a figure appears at the door.

               Haven lights a match and tosses it on the soaked bales of 
               uniforms. They blaze up instantly. The man shoots as Haven 
               ducks away.

<b>               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               As the shot RINGS out. Pete and Mick, surrounded by many 
               men, turn swiftly. Flame and smoke emerge from the warehouse. 
               They start swiftly across, drawing guns. The man at the door 
               shoots again into the smoking interior. An answering SHOT 
               from Haven fells him.

<b>               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               As Haven makes his way back to the open window. He crawls 
               out swiftly. Now the building is in flames. He can hear 
               shouting and, as he moves away, the useless attempt of men 
               to put out the blaze, working with buckets of water.

<b>               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               As Haven starts for the woods. The flames now light the ground 
               around, and Pete appears around the side of the building. 
               Pete fires and Haven draws and shoots. Pete whirls away, hit 
               but still on his feet, driving forward, trying to shoot again 
               and this time Haven drills him clean and Pete goes down to 
               stay. Other men come up as Haven makes for the woods, 
               disappears.

               Mick Marion and a dozen men appear, shooting. Mick suddenly 
               changes his mind, turns past the body of Pete, gets his horse 
               and heads back to town full tilt.

<b>               INT. WOODS - NIGHT

               As Haven watches the flaming building. The slowly approaching 
               figures of the men are illumined in the big light of the 
               fire. Haven smiles, turns to the horse and moves slowly 
               through the trees to a place where he can mount; then mounts 
               and rides for it, SHOTS following him as he breaks into the 
               clear some hundred yards away and heads for the road that 
               Mick Marion took back to town. Bent low, Haven rides for his 
               life -- and makes it...

               As Haven rides up, a detachment of men supervised by Stellman 
               is forming beside mounts in the parade ground. Haven dismounts 
               and starts inside. He glances at his wagon parked outside. 
               It is the one Mrs. Caslon took from him. He smiles slightly 
               as he notes it.

               Haven walks in, brushes past the desk sergeant with a cursory

               As Haven enters. Mrs. Caslon is there, and Iles, in full

               pauses, glances at Mrs. Caslon and then faces the explosive 
               Iles.

               Haven dips into a lining pocket under his arm and tosses a 
               paper at Iles. Iles glances at it, then looks, thunderstruck, 
               at Haven.

               He shakes hands with Iles for second, then Iles goes out 
               abruptly. Outside we can hear abrupt commands to the Sergeant 
               before the door closes. Haven takes out his pipe, looks at 
               the silent, dumb-struck Mrs Caslon. He smiles at her slightly. 
               She gets her voice at last.

               hardly aware of Mrs Caslon's presence.

               and looks out.

               As Haven walks outside towards his waiting horse. He pauses, 
               pipe in mouth, lighting the pipe now, his face intensely 
               interested as he watches the men form on the parade ground 
               in front of the mounted Iles and Stellman.

               FULL SHOT of soldiers. As they mount to a brisk command, and 
               the color bearer takes position. Iles barks out a command; 
               the column forms into marching order. On the double quick, 
               the cavalry company starts out and on the way.

               CLOSE SHOT of Haven as he watches; his eyes lighting a little, 
               the pipe in hand. We feel that he'd like to go too in this 
               moment.

               ANOTHER ANGLE from Haven's view, as the column of cavalry 
               departs. Haven waves his hand, a half salute, a half gesture 
               to Iles as Iles salutes him in passing. Then only the dust 
               remains and Haven's gaze lingers. His face changes. It becomes 
               grim. He slowly knocks the ashes from the pipe, pockets it. 
               He slowly mounts the horse. He takes out his gun and checks 
               it. Then slowly he rides away, like a man on a mission he 
               dislikes but cannot evade.

               As Prince moves into a shadowy corner.

               ANGLE ON the door as Haven enters and looks around. He sees 
               no one. The place seems utterly deserted. It is soundless. 
               CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven as he moves slowly. He has replaced the 
               gun, but he is alert.

               ANGLE ON Prince as he watches Haven, now a perfect target, 
               not looking in his direction. Prince raises the gun a little, 
               but the dice in his over hand click ever so faintly.

               SHOT OF Haven as he stops dead in his tracks, hand on the 
               gun again, alert at the slight sound of the dice. Now facing 
               towards the shadow where Prince is hidden. He stands ready 
               and rigid for a long still moment. When there is no further 
               sound or movement, he goes on towards the stairs.

               ANGLE ON Prince as he moves slightly from the shadow as Haven 
               goes to the stairs. Prince is ready to shoot again, but now 
               the angle on Haven up the stairs is no good. He lowers the 
               gun with disgust, then moves softly out of the shadow.

               She is standing with her back to the desk, her fingers tight

               around and then at her. There is a slight smile on her face.

               At the bare rustle of SOUND behind him (and the memory of 
               her eyes going past him) Haven whirls, stopping aside and 
               drawing as he does so. And just as he does so, Prince, in 
               the doorway, fires. Haven shoots so that the shots RING OUT 
               almost simultaneously. Prince topples forward on his knees 
               and then his face. The dice roll out of his unclenched left 
               hand.

               MED. SHOT of Haven and Charlie as their eyes read the dice. 
               Haven puts away the gun. Charlie is still leaning against 
               the desk, but there is a strange look on her face. A thin 
               smile for Haven. Now she sags a little and Haven realizes 
               she has been hit. He starts to her and she turns away towards 
               the couch. He catches her as she sags again, and helps her 
               down gently on the couch.

               ANGLE on couch as Haven kneels beside her. He starts to pull 
               away the top of her dress, but the wound is close to the 
               heart. She shakes her head.
