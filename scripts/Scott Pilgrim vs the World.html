          from the Japanese phrase paku-paku

</b>          It was football season and for some
          reason, all the little jocks wanted
          me. Matthew was the only non-white,
          non-jock boy in school, probably in
          the entire state, so we joined
          forces and took 'em all out. We
          were one hell of a team. Nothing
          could beat Matthew's mystical
          powers. Nothing but pre-teen
          capriciousness. We only kissed
          once. After a week and a half, I
          told him to hit the showers.

          days ago, three hours before his big
          breakup. He blames this largely on the
          haircut and has been cutting his own

          RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona
          CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES
          into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere.
          PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It
          smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out.
          Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt
          SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt
          wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window.

          Ramona springs off of various pieces of furniture, LEAPING
          towards Roxy and PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. Roxy REELS and
          SLAMS into the wall, leaving a dent in it.

          an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that

          All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate

          bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

          it was like a call to adventure, a

          want something bad enough I have to
          fight for it. So I did. There were

          approached a deep cave and went
          through a crazy ordeal, during
          which I totally seized the sword.

          Scott ATTACKS with his sword. Gideon BLOCKS, disarms Scott
          with one move, spins and BUTTS Scott in the face with the
          hilt of the sword. Scott teeters on the edge of the pyramid.
          Knives throws her knives. Gideon's lightning fast sword
          deflects them, SHING SHING!
          Gideon wheels towards Ramona, expecting her to move. She
          looks doubtful, takes a hesitant step towards him. He grins.

          Ramona knees Gideon in the balls.
          Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her
          scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him.
          Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of

<b>          FREEZE FRAMES.
</b>          Knives KICKS Gideon in the stomach and Scott follows with a
          PUNCH IN THE NOSE, sending Gideon sliding across the floor.
          Gideon gets back to his feet via backflip. He shakes off the
          assault and grins.

          going to be in my digestive tract
          for seven years!
          Gideon throws a series of Wushu moves that give him a POWER
          UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an
          'œX'� with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD.
          He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely
          dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time
          to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'œX'�.
          Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down.
          Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and
          scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her.
          SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in
          the air. Gideon spins again and swings upward. Scott blocks
          with his sword and is sent UP into the air. Gideon jumps
          after him. They CLASH in the air. Scott's sword SHATTERS.

          sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE,
          cancelling out Gideon's digital sword.
          Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully
          tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom.
          Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon.
          COMBO ATTACK! FREEZE FRAME PUNCHES: Knives kicks and Scott
          punches, sending Gideon back and forth like a pinball: KICK
          PUNCH KICK PUNCH KICK! Gideon's face smashes with each
          impact.
          Ramona rises to see Scott and Knives kicking ass.
          Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor,
          she kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a
          wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning.
          Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his
          glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott.

          Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-

<b>          SCOTT (O.S.)
</b>          Hey... mind if I tag along?

</b>          Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.

<b>                         RAMONA
</b>          You want to come with me?

<b>                         SCOTT
</b>
<b>                         (HOPEFUL)
</b>          I thought maybe we could... try
          again?
          Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
          earlier. Scott takes it.
          We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
          middle of the street, snow swirling around it.
          Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
          over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
          to spring.
          Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
          '˜Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
          cell phone airwaves.

</b>          Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
          Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
          with Gideon Graves at the grand
          opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
          was apparently awesome.

<b>          STACEY (V.O.)
</b>          Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
          mean bananas. My little brother
          kicked a guy's head off. Literally.
          It was unbelievable. Someone
          seriously should have been filming
          it.
          Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
          heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.
