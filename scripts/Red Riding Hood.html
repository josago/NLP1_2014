</b>
          FLAMES fill the SCREEN. Then: the gentle voice of an
          OLD WOMAN, barely more than a whisper...

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          I am a common woman. I was born
          in a common cottage in a common
          village. My life would likely be
          no different from yours, were it
          not for the most uncommon events
          that occurred during the winter of
          the Year of Our Lord Thirteen
          Hundred and Twenty-five. I
          learned many things that winter.
          About people. About love. But
          mainly, I learned about loss.
          A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns
          out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          To this day, I am the only person
          that I know to be living who knows
          the whole truth about that
          horrible time. This is my tale.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered,
          scarred, returning from the Crusades. Their armor is in
          disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East.
          They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a
          nearby roadside. LIGHTNING flashes in the distance.
          One of them, a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might
          weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous HORSE to a
          tree. He strokes the horse's neck, calming.
          Then: A WOLF HOWLS in the distance. The Boy suddenly
          looks nervous, too. He quickly joins the others at the
          campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT.

<b>                         TEENAGE BOY

<b>                         FAT KNIGHT
</b>          Hear what?
          The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful.

</b>          I know what he told you. He told
          you about the Wolf. The Beast of
          Villiers la CroisÃ©e.
          (off Boy's look)
          The people of that village have
          been spreading that nonsense since
          before you were a tickle in your
          daddy's prick. I'd give you a
          whipping for believing it if I
          thought it would do any good.
          The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks.

<b>                         OLD KNIGHT
</b>          I used to travel these woods.
          They told the same stories then
          that they do now. Only I heard
          them from a man who actually saw
          the beast with his own eyes.

<b>                         FAT KNIGHT
</b>          Half the people in these parts
          claim to have seen it.

<b>                         OLD KNIGHT
</b>          This man claimed it was the last
          thing he ever saw. The Wolf took
          his eyes. And half his face.
          (off their looks)
          I saw his scars and empty eye
          sockets. His skin looked like it
          was on inside-out. It didn't seem
          to me like the kind of thing a man
          would make up a story about.
          He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look.

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
          It's raining now. The Knights sleep underneath the cart
          for shelter. Lightning FLASHES.
          Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened
          NEIGHS. The Boy stirs, but by the time he awakens, there
          is only the sound of the RAIN. Did he imagine it? He
          reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate.
          The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse... but
          all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind. In a
          FLASH of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone.
          Then he hears something. A strange GNAWING sound.
          TEARING and POPPING. He slowly turns...

<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The
          horse is on its side, WHEEZING helplessly. And there's
          something crouched next to it. We can't make out what it
          is, only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE, shrouded in shadow.
          Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive.
          The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles
          back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake.

<b>                         FAT KNIGHT
</b>          What the devil are you --?!

<b>                         TEENAGE BOY
</b>          Wait, wait! Be quiet!
          He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen.
          FOOTSTEPS. Approaching through the mud. The Boy's hand
          clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and
          stays him, terrified. The Boy follows his look.
          We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward
          them. But what the men see scares them shitless. It
          stops near the cart. The men huddle together, watching
          as it slowly starts to walk around the cart --
          -- then suddenly jumps atop it. The Figure is now above
          them. With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden
          cart CREAK and bend under its weight. A long beat.
          Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men,
          startling them. It pauses. The men cower, shivering...
          Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed
          nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it.
          Lightning FLASHES. A shadow falls over them.
          The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips
          in the mud. The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old
          Knight starts screaming, something GROWLS, and the Boy
          stops short at what he sees. The Fat Knight runs.

<b>                         TEENAGE BOY
</b>          Wait! We have to help him!
          The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We
          hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made
          while eating the horse. The Boy quickly looks around...
          ... sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud,
          fallen from the overturned wagon. He grabs it and as the
          Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground. He hefts the
          blade. He's young, but he has used this before. A lot.
          Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he
          confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight.

</b>          The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking
          back. He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster.
          Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in,
          his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING
          and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER.
          He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING
          RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way
          to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving
          fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it --
          A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it.
          The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't
          stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands
          and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters
          surging underneath him. He has almost made it across...
          ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back.
          Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us,
          stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS.
          The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly
          falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him
          begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back.
          The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in.
          He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away.
          He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at
          the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat
          Knight dives headfirst off the tree --
          -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by
          the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up
          at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the
          water. He weeps. Then, abruptly --
          -- he is yanked up out of sight.

          A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig
          that has been hung upside down by its hind legs. It
          kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan.
          VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road. A MERCHANT sells
          his wares. Dogs run and BARK. A DISHEVELLED MAN locked
          up in the stockade. A BLACKSMITH's hammer CLANGS.
          On the surface, a typical medieval village. But
          something is wrong here. A pall hangs over the place.
          The people are subdued, beaten. A TITLE comes up:

          A tiny spider spins its web. CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a
          pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it. Her name is
          ISABELLE. She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl
          around on her hand, fascinated.

<b>          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY
</b>
          The home of a medieval peasant. Isabelle's mother,
          SUZETTE (late 30s), and sister, LUCIE (18, plain-
          looking), work in the garden. They look up as Isabelle
          emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider.

<b>                         LUCIE
</b>          Honestly, Isabelle. Just kill it.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I can't. It's the fifth
          commandment. Thou shalt not kill.
          Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the
          spider crawl off her hand. She watches it skitter away,
          then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I'm going to take Father some
          water.

<b>                         SUZETTE
</b>          All right. Don't be long.
          Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously
          heads toward the village. Lucie watches her go, dubious.

          Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well. Even

          A CARPENTER building a timber-framed structure notices
          his TWO YOUNG APPRENTICES (late teens) casting distracted
          glances in her direction. He calls out to her, smiling.

<b>          EXT. NEW FIELD - DAY

          The village WOODCUTTERS are chopping down trees and
          hauling away the lumber. A GROUP of them are in the
          midst of what looks like a serious conversation.
          Isabelle approaches them with the bucket of water. One
          of them turns and sees Isabelle. His name is CESAIRE
          (handsome, 40s). He hides his dour expression and gives
          Isabelle a big smile. She smiles back.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Mother thought you might be
          thirsty.

<b>                         CESAIRE
</b>          That was very thoughtful of her.
          He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the
          bucket. Isabelle's gaze drifts from him to another
          woodcutter, working off by himself. His name is PETER
          (21, darkly handsome, almost dangerous-looking).
          He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment, then
          wipes his brow and calls out to the WOODCUTTER BOSS.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I'm taking a break.

</b>          A break? Does that mean you're
          going to start working?
          The other Woodcutters LAUGH. Peter walks away.
          Isabelle's gaze lingers on him too long. Cesaire
          notices, not entirely comfortable with what he sees...

          Not far from where the Woodcutters work, Peter waits,

<b>                         ISABELLE

          suspect something.

</b>          I don't care. I wish she would
          tell him. I want everyone to

          the point where he figures out
          what I'm doing with his daughter.
          Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look.
          Through the trees, she sees her father and the group of
          grim Woodcutters, still in serious conversation.

          Three men. They found them this
          morning just off the Center Road.
          At least they think it was three
          men. There wasn't enough left to
          piece them back together.
          A long beat as Isabelle takes this in. Then:

</b>          Was it the Wolf?

          Isabelle shudders. No, it couldn't have been.

</b>          We should have killed that monster
          a long time ago.

          An OLD WOMAN opens the door and waves to them. She's
          stooped and withered, but her eyes are bright and
          beautiful. She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace
          with a crucifix on it. This is Isabelle's GRANDMOTHER.

          Isabelle gives her a sad look.

          There's a knock at the door. Isabelle answers, revealing
          HENRI (18). He's tall and good-looking, but still
          awkward in his body. Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Hello, Isabelle.

          That's months away. A lot can
          happen in a few months.
          Henri seems disappointed. She sees this and reconsiders.

          He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower.
          She takes it, suddenly blushing. But just then, she sees
          Peter walking toward them with another WOODCUTTER.

          Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri
          surprised and a little hurt. She passes Peter, her eyes

          In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving
          Lucie a stern lecture. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle.

          There's a fork in the path and Rosemaria stops at it. A

          uneducated these days.
          (off their looks)
          Our village was not always like
          this. When I was young, this was
          a very special place. Traders and
          merchants came here from lands I'd
          never heard of selling things I
          had never seen. King Philip the

          that, of course, was before the

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER

          people from the village. Break
          down doors in the middle of the
          night and snatch children right
          out of their beds. Rumors began

          die. And that was why my husband

          to kill the Wolf. But instead, it
          killed him.

          for it anymore. But something had
          changed. The Wolf stopped killing
          in the village. Even our
          livestock were usually safe as
          long as they were brought inside.
          So we decided it was safer to
          compromise. We gave the Wolf its
          one night a month, the night of
          the full moon, and it has left us

</b>          Everyone knows what should be
          done. But it's not always easy to
          do what you know is right.
          Sometimes it's easier to settle
          for being safe.
          Isabelle frowns, unsatisfied.

</b>
          Villagers hurriedly bring their sheep and pigs into their
          homes. Doors are shut and barricaded. Cesaire is
          outside the family cottage, nailing the shutters closed.

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK
</b>
          Isabelle's family sits at the dinner table in silence.
          Cesaire sets mugs of beer out for everyone. Lucie numbly
          picks at her food, doesn't touch her beer. Isabelle
          works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          You were right. About Peter. I
          was being childish.

          Cesaire and Suzette stop eating. Suzette levels a cold
          look at Isabelle.

<b>                         SUZETTE

          him. And I don't love Henri.
          Lucie does.
          Lucie looks up, surprised to be dragged into this.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          She's right. It's not fair. I

          A beat. Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers:

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Next to her, Lucie looks over
          at her. She's wide awake. She sneaks out of bed...

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Lucie carefully sneaks down from the loft and quietly
          puts on a RED RIDING HOOD. She accidently kicks a pan on
          the floor and puts a hand down to silence it. She
          listens to hear if anyone has awakened. Nothing.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          Lucie slips out of the house. She shivers in the cold,
          pulls the riding hood around her. FULL MOON in the sky.
          The village looks deserted, a ghost town. Eerie, still,
          dark. The moon-sign swings in the breeze, CREAKING on
          its rusty hooks. Lucie hurries away toward the woods...

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
          Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from
          the village. She startles at every sound. She looks up.
          The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the
          skeletal branches of the dark trees...
          She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at
          earlier. Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it...

<b>          EXT. GULLY - NIGHT
</b>
          Lucie reaches an OLD ROPE BRIDGE. It spans a deep gully
          and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks. Lucie
          gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it...
          The boards CREAK loudly under her feet. The bridge sways
          in the wind. She carefully makes her way across, only
          breathing when she is safely on the other side.

          Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight.
          She stands in the middle of it, next to a large rock, and
          looks all around. She's alone, cold and afraid. Then...
          ... she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places
          it on the rock. She begins to disrobe, folding her dress
          and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile.
          Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her
          breasts, shivering with cold. And fear.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the
          dark branches of the trees obscure her from view. Then,
          somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS in the night...

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAWN

          Isabelle wakes up, groggy. Lucie's bed is empty.

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY

          Children are playing, a BOY chasing several giggling
          GIRLS, growling and waving his hands like claws.

<b>                         BOY

          you up!

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something
          that makes her stop short. The other Children gather
          behind her, all frozen by what they see...
          CROWS are picking at a bloody carcass. All we can see of
          it is a human hand. A crow gnaws on one of the fingers.

<b>          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY
</b>
          The girls are at their lessons. Suddenly, there's an
          urgent KNOCK at the door. Everyone stops, surprised.
          Grandmother answers it. It's a YOUNG MAN, sweaty and out
          of breath from running.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER

          The Young Man glances at Isabelle. Something about the

          Isabelle hurries into the clearing with Roxanne,
          Prudence, and Rosemaria trailing behind her. A crowd has
          gathered. She pushes through it, then stop short.
          Lucie is dead. We don't see what's been done to her, but
          Roxanne turns away and vomits. Cesaire and Suzette are
          already here. He holds her as she cries on his shoulder.
          Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered.

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed, clutching
          Lucie's cloak to her chest. She's cried her eyes out.
          Grandmother sets down a cup of tea. As Isabelle watches,
          Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          It's my little secret. A pinch
          will help you rest. A little more
          and you'll sleep through the end

          Grandmother smiles. Isabelle smiles back, weak.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I think I'd like that.

          Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them,

          Lucie's body lies on the table. Isabelle watches as

          Claude, the deaf boy we saw performing magic. The
          priest, FATHER AUGUSTE, conducts the service.

          Villagers leave the church. Claude is playing in the

          Embarrassed, Roxanne quickly grabs Claude and drags him
          away, but he fights her, crying and kicking.
          Isabelle's family is met by Henri and his father, Adrien.

<b>                         ADRIEN

          He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he
          briefly glances at Suzette. Isabelle notices the look,
          but then she spots Peter leaving the church. She makes
          brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts.

          and splashes hard in a shallow underground river. The
          torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore

          pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades.
          Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his
          sword. He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling
          for it in the water. The wounded animal growls, blood

          It chewed off his private parts.
          Isabelle had not heard this. Henri doesn't stop working.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          And I did nothing. I was too
          scared. I couldn't move. I just

</b>          No. I don't want you here.
          Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves. Henri just
          keeps hammering away on the anvil.

          A coffin is lowered into a grave. Father Auguste blesses
          it. Henri stands at his side. Isabelle is here with
          Roxanne. Lucrece eyes Isabelle, then whispers to her:

          CAROUSING. Every cottage in the village is dark. Except
          one. Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it...

<b>          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle tentatively enters. There aren't many people
          here, just Marguerite and a few ROWDY MEN making a lot of
          noise. Isabelle instantly sees what she's here for:
          Cesaire is slumped in a corner, drunk and passed out.

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him
          into the bed next to Suzette. He's already half-asleep.
          Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look, then turns away.
          Isabelle sighs. She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his
          forehead. As she stands, he clumsily takes her hand.

<b>                         CESAIRE

          The wolf's head has been placed atop a stake. Children
          throw rocks at it. Isabelle watches with Roxanne and
          Prudence.

<b>                         PRUDENCE

          overnight everything just changes.
          But Isabelle is distracted. Amidst the morning bustle,
          she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter. Roxanne notices.
          Just then, they hear HORSES approaching. A lot of them.
          Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly
          apprehensive. The girls turn toward the sound and see...
          ... A DOZEN SOLDIERS in identical armor, silver helmets
          gleaming in the sun, riding into the square atop armored
          steeds. The Villagers gape at them in awe.
          The Soldiers ride escort to a WHITE COACH with a red
          cross on it, drawn by two horses: one white, one black.
          A FIGURE rides inside, cloaked in darkness. Isabelle
          gives it an uneasy look.
          Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his
          helmet adorned with a blood-red plume. He brings the
          caravan to a halt in front of the Merchant's shop.

          All eyes turn to the figure in the coach. Only a
          bejeweled hand is visible, resting on the coach's window.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY (LATER)

          A Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and
          another opens the door. The whole village has turned
          out, but they're keeping their distance. Even Attewater,
          standing front and center, seems uneasy.
          The figure emerges from the coach. A grizzled man with
          penetrating eyes and a black beard, wearing a strange
          amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly
          battle armor. A broadsword hangs from his hip, the hilt
          depicting Christ on the cross. With the sword sheathed,
          the cross is upside-down. This is FATHER SOLOMON.

<b>                         ATTEWATER

          Solomon makes no response. His eyes are on the severed
          wolf's head on display. Attewater smiles proudly.

          to the armored Soldiers and their swords. A beat.

          yellow teeth. I hacked at it with
          an axe and suddenly it was gone.
          There was blood on my axe. I had
          cut off one of its paws. I picked

</b>          The festival was to celebrate the
          death of the Wolf.

<b>                         MERCHANT
</b>          And we say that it's dead! We've
          spent every full moon for the past
          forty years cowering in our homes.
          We've earned a celebration.

          Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look. Solomon shrugs.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Have your festival. I will stay
          on here until then to ensure that
          you have the celebration you all
          so richly deserve.
          The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug
          Merchant. A look passes between Solomon and his Captain.
          Isabelle catches it... and finds it unsettling.

          The festival is in full swing. A bonfire ROARS. The
          Villagers sing and drink. A MAN in a wolf costume jumps
          out and startles the women and children. The children
          chase him with sticks and he comically runs away.
          Isabelle watches their antics with Roxanne and Prudence.
          Claude is laughing and chasing the man in the wolf
          costume, but an OLDER BOY purposefully trips him.
          Another BOY steals his cap and teases him. Marguerite is
          too busy carousing to notice. Roxanne frowns.

          Just then, Henri stumbles toward Isabelle with a beer,
          clearly the latest of many. He follows her look and sees
          that she's watching Peter. Henri glares at him...
          ... then abruptly pushes his way toward Peter and grabs
          him roughly by the shoulder, spinning him around. Peter
          is surprised, but ready to laugh it off.

          Isabelle's eyes go to the sky. The sun has finally set.
          The moon has risen, silver and full. Isabelle gazes up

          there's something about its face that isn't canine at
          all, but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon.
          Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks,
          revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers.
          Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the
          Wolf. They've been lying in wait and now they have it
          surrounded. The Wolf SNARLS at them.

<b>          DIE, BEAST! AND LONG LIVE GOD'S

          The Villagers caught between them trample one another to
          get away. A MAN gets knocked into the bonfire. Flaming
          logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage ABLAZE.
          The Wolf swipes Solomon's Soldiers aside like rag dolls.
          They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for
          the beast. It swats one of them right through the wall
          of a nearby cottage. The ambush has backfired.
          The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up,
          trying to help. Claude fights and screams, but the
          Carpenter carries him away. Roxanne starts toward him --
          -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse. Solomon grabs
          the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the
          Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance. The Wolf catches
          the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse.
          Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more
          Soldiers join the fight. The Wolf sees them coming. It
          attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it
          to the ground. As the Soldiers close in --
          -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at
          them, knocking them down like bowling pins. Another
          Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it
          smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to
          the ground with one enormous paw.
          Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags
          her away from the ongoing battle.

          The Carpenter runs away with Claude in his arms, but
          Claude bites his hand and wriggles free. Claude falls to
          the ground and dashes back toward the square.

          Roxanne runs through town like a rat in a maze, jostled
          by the fleeing Villagers. Isabelle races after her.

</b>          Claude! Claude!
          Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her, begging for help.

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Have you seen my brother? Please!
          But Rosemaria just pushes her aside, panicked. An
          instant later -- the Wolf appears out of nowhere, jumping
          on Rosemaria. She screams, then -- CRUNCH. The screams
          stop. Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror, then run.

<b>          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

          The Captain RINGS the church bell. People are fleeing
          the village and running toward the church.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          The few Villagers left hurry into their homes and bolt
          the doors behind them. TWO SOLDIERS search the nearly
          empty streets for the Wolf, swords drawn.
          Soldier #1 looks down... and sees bloody paw prints in
          the snow. He points them out to Solider #2. They follow
          the tracks to a corner, carefully peer around it...
          The Wolf is about ten feet away, loudly tearing meat from
          Rosemaria's body. Soldier #1 gestures for his companion
          to approach from the other side. They split up.
          Soldier #1 peers out at the Wolf... but it's gone. The
          street is empty. Only Rosemaria's body lying in the
          bloodstained snow. He ducks back around the corner...
          ... and we see that the Wolf is now right behind him.
          Meanwhile, Soldier #2 is stealthily making his way into
          position... when he suddenly hears Soldier #1 SCREAMING.
          Soldier #2 quickly ducks inside a nearby cottage...

<b>          INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          ... and peers out the window. He sees Soldier #1
          painfully crawling through the snow, clutching a mangled
          and bloody wound on his shoulder.

          Soldier #2 ducks back from the window. No way. He's not
          going out there. Then: SNIFF. SNIFF.
          There's a shadow visible under the crack of the cottage
          door. And a big black snout pressed up against it,
          SNIFFING out its prey. Soldier #2 readies his sword...
          ... but then the Wolf moves away. A long beat. The
          Soldier edges toward the door. The shadow does not
          return. He slowly reaches out a hand to open the door...
          Suddenly, the door is blasted off its hinges and the Wolf
          bursts inside. It stands on top of the door, pinning the
          Soldier beneath it. The Soldier tries to raise his
          sword, but can't. The Wolf SNARLS down at him, drooling.

</b>
          The Wolf is dragging Soldier #2's body out of the cottage
          by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up. It's
          heard something. It's being watched. It looks up...
          ... and sees Claude standing at the end of the street,
          paralyzed with fear. The Wolf GROWLS, blood dripping
          from its chin. Claude runs. The Wolf leaps after him.
          Claude turns a corner, looks back, sees the Wolf headed
          right for him. Claude ducks into an alley and the Wolf
          follows him...

<b>          EXT./INT. BARN - NIGHT
</b>
          ... only to find Claude has disappeared. The Wolf
          follows Claude's tracks in the snow to the door of a barn
          and peers inside. The barn appears to be empty...
          ... but Claude is hiding in a hayloft. The Wolf SNIFFS
          the air. Pushes the door open with its nose and pads
          inside. Looks around. Claude shivers. But just then:

<b>          ROXANNE (O.S.)
</b>          Claude! Claude!!
          The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening...

          Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers, Roxanne
          looking for Claude, Isabelle trying to stop her.

          Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds
          herself face-to-face with the Wolf. Roxanne screams.
          They run back the way they came, turn another corner --

          Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make
          it. Isabelle jumps down to help her...
          ... just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley. The
          girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward
          them, SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange, near-
          human eyes. Then, inexplicably... the Wolf speaks.

</b>          Well, well. You look very pretty
          this evening, my dear. Good
          enough to eat.
          The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive. The Devil's
          voice. Isabelle stammers, unable to believe her senses.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          It's considered polite to thank
          someone when they pay you a
          compliment. Are you being

          The Wolf GROWLS, cutting her off, and turns back to
          Isabelle. It moves closer. Isabelle looks into its
          eyes. They suddenly seem very big and deep, almost
          hypnotizing. She seems to fall into them...

</b>          We are the same, you and I. We
          are both wild things. You show
          one face to the world, but there
          is another face that you hide. A
          fire burning inside you, waiting
          to be released.
          The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its
          way up. It SNARLS with satisfaction, savoring her scent.

</b>          Yes. I can smell it on you even
          now.
          Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its
          forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its
          muzzle only inches from her face. She recoils.

          Come away with me. Or I will kill

          blood will be on your hands.
          Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after
          it, but the Wolf is already too far away. It looks back
          at him. A silent challenge passes between them. And
          then the Wolf is gone.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          It appears my expertise is not as
          appreciated as I was led to
          believe.
          He turns to leave. Suddenly, Attewater steps forward.

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>          Wait!
          Attewater drops to one knee. Solomon stops and gives him
          an appraising look. Then Solomon turns to the Villagers.
          After a moment, the Reeve drops to his knee. One by one,
          the Villagers kneel to Solomon. Henri and Father Auguste
          are among the last, but they reluctantly kneel as well.

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>          We will do what must be done.
          A beat. Then Solomon offers his hand. Attewater kisses
          Solomon's ring. Henri and Roxanne exchange uneasy looks.

<b>          INT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY
</b>
          There's an urgent knock at the door. Peter quickly opens
          it. It's Isabelle. He ushers her inside. As soon as
          the door is shut, he takes her in his arms. She gives
          him a concerned look. He looks tired, drawn and pale.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I was up all night worrying about
          you. Thank God you're safe.
          But something about her expression gives him pause. She
          looks up at him, struggling with what she has to say.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Peter... My mother's hurt. I
          can't leave. Not now.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I thought you didn't want to wait.

</b>          I don't have any choice. It's not

          Attewater and Father Auguste.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Silver. This is our most potent

          many such creatures. But never
          one as powerful as this.

</b>          It has not survived this long by
          being obvious. The signs will be
          subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness.
          Strange behavior. Strange smells.
          (off their looks)
          Well, none of them smell good, but

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>          Yes, it's trying to trick us
          again. This has been happening
          for forty years. It must be an
          old man by now. The hair should
          have been gray.

</b>          Not necessarily. It may be the
          child or grandchild of the
          werewolf that first struck here.

          inherit the curse. But even then
          it will lie dormant unless she
          eats human flesh. Only then will
          the bite of a male werewolf change
          her. Only then can she become a
          werewolf and capable of passing
          the curse on to her own children.

</b>          Of course. It could be any one of
          you.

          Yes. But I don't believe he meant

          Father Auguste eyes them nervously. A beat.

          behind this veil of feigned idiocy
          is the fiend that has plagued your
          village. However, in order for
          the sentence of death to be
          carried out, the Church requires
          either a confession or the
          testimony of a witness who has
          seen the accused in his
          transformed state. Since the

          witness. Isabelle Ordeville.

</b>          But the Wolf is free. And the

          deaths of everyone that I love.
          I'd rather spend a lifetime of
          misery than let that happen.

          Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that.
          Suddenly, a HIDEOUS, INARTICULATE SCREAM echoes in the

          Marguerite grabs her, but Roxanne turns and shoves her to
          the ground. Marguerite starts to get up, but Roxanne
          snatches a knife from off the table and points it at her.

          Do you have any idea who I am? I
          am the Witchfinder General. I
          have fought in the Holy Land. I
          have waded hip deep in blood and
          resisted all the temptations of
          the infidels. And you seek to
          stay the hand of justice with such
          a tawdry bribe? Leave here, girl,
          before I have you whipped.
          Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag
          her away. Roxanne struggles against them.

          Solomon looks up sharply. The Soldiers stop. Solomon
          crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne. She

          sleep by Soldiers barging into their home. One of them
          climbs into the loft and yanks Isabelle out of bed.
          Cesaire leaps to his feet, but is viciously beaten down.

          covered with hideous burns. He moans again. Isabelle

</b>          The Wolf never used to attack in

          festival. It's a coward at heart.
          It would kill whole families in
          their homes, but it always stayed
          in the shadows. It never would
          have shown itself in the old days.

</b>          The night my father died. I saw
          the Wolf pass by, dragging him by
          the neck. I was so terrified I
          couldn't move or make a sound. I
          remember every detail of that
          moment. The way the moonlight
          gleamed off the Wolf's coat. The
          soundless way it moved. I even
          remember the way it smelled. A
          thick, greasy, musky stink.

<b>                         (BEAT)

          now.
          A beat. They stand frozen. Glaring at one another.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          You accuse me and I'll bring you
          down with me. All they can do is
          take my life. You have more to
          lose.

<b>                         HENRI

          Grandmother sits at the table, writing a letter in Latin
          with a quill. She doesn't notice the veil that separates
          her bedchamber rippling, as if in a gentle breeze...
          Suddenly, she hears MOVEMENT. She looks up. The veil is
          still. She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with
          her cane, her back to the veil...
          ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a
          weapon. Glancing back, she sees the veil move again...
          Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the
          veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting
          anything. A beat.

          Another beat. The veil settles and is still. Then:
          A FIGURE lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching
          out at us. It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and
          wrestles the cane from her grip with the other.
          She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker.
          The Figure whips out a knife. Grandmother sees it, but
          can do nothing. The knife flashes.
          Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure
          drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless. A pool of
          blood slowly spreads out from underneath her.
          The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the
          letter Grandmother was writing. He quickly scans it and
          angrily tosses it in the fire...
          Then he hears something. FOOTSTEPS, crunching through
          the snow. He hurries to the window and peers out...
          It's Roxanne and Prudence. Roxanne looks like hell, but
          here for lessons as usual. The Figure ducks out of
          sight. A moment later, they're KNOCKING on the door.
          Their feet are visible under the crack.
          The Figure sidles alongside the door, BREATHING heavily.
          Another KNOCK. On the floor inside, the pool of blood is
          expanding toward the door...
          The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his
          knife... then whispers to the girls through the door,
          disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp:

          thirty seconds, the girls will be standing in it.
          Outside, Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look...
          ... then turn and walk away. The Figure breathes a sigh
          of relief and takes his hand away from the knife.
          But then Roxanne stops. And looks back. The Figure
          secretly watches from the window.
          Roxanne walks back to the cottage. The blood is about to
          run under the door. The Figure grabs the door handle and
          readies the knife. Roxanne stands on the doorstep.

          Figure stands poised to throw open the door... but at the
          last instant, Roxanne turns and walks away. She doesn't

<b>                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)
</b>          Flour, by your own confession,
          have committed acts of vulgar
          heresy, convict you of the sins of
          witches and condemn you to the
          mercy of werewolf. This is the
          sentence given.
          Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows.
          Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father
          Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Help...
          Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably
          as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Help me... Please... Help me...
          The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees
          them going... and suddenly SCREAMS.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>
<b>          HELP ME! PLEASE! WHY WON'T
</b>
<b>          SOMEBODY HELP ME?!
</b>          The Villagers startle. She SCREAMS again, struggling
          against the stocks. But no one comes to her aid.

<b>          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DUSK
</b>
          Isabelle's SCREAMS can be heard from here. Roxanne lies
          in her bed, sobbing her heart out...

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK (LATER)
</b>
          Almost everyone has left. Isabelle slumps in the stocks,
          silent and exhausted. Father Auguste sadly walks away,
          leaving only Prudence. She nervously approaches.

<b>                         PRUDENCE
</b>          Isabelle? Can you hear me?

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I can hear you.

<b>                         PRUDENCE

          sorry she is. She only said those
          things to save her brother.

</b>          I want you to know that you may
          have fooled Roxanne, but you don't
          fool me. Not anymore. You were
          always too good. Too pretty.
          Nobody could be as perfect as you.
          You tricked us. And now you're
          going to get what you deserve.
          A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I think you'd better go now.
          Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.

<b>                         PRUDENCE
</b>          Yes. It won't be long now.

<b>          ACROSS THE SQUARE
</b>          The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He
          watches Prudence leave. Solomon and Attewater join him.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          No one shoots until I give the
          order.
          Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with
          longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws
          an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver.

          The streets are empty. The FULL MOON has risen...

</b>
          Isabelle is now alone. The streets are empty. Around
          the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with
          arrows strung on their bows. Attewater shifts nervously.
          Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL. Isabelle gasps. The
          Soldiers ready their bows. Attewater shrinks back.
          Another HOWL. Closer now. Isabelle tries to pull her
          hands out of the stocks. Then: Solomon spots something.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          There.
          The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE
          is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle...

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Hold your fire...
          Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists
          torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly --
          -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see
          what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams.
          Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view:

<b>          HENRI (O.S.)
</b>          Hey! Stop it! It's me!
          Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and
          looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes. It's Henri.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Get away from me!

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I'm not the Wolf! The moon is
          out! Look, I haven't turned!
          Isabelle realizes. He's right. It couldn't be him.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I'm trying to get you out of this.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Yes! Yes, please hurry!
          Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and
          chisel to break open the stocks. BANG! BANG!

<b>                         CAPTAIN
</b>          He's going to free her.
          Then: another HOWL. Almost on top of them.

          Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG!
          The lock is cleaved in two. Henri throws the stock open
          and helps Isabelle out of the mask. She looks like hell.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Can you stand?
          Isabelle nods. In the loft:

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Kill him.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain
          strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim...
          Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot.
          The arrow whizzes by Henri's head. Attewater calls out:

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>
<b>          RUN!
</b>          Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a
          dagger into his back. Henri drags Isabelle to her feet
          and they run away, arrows ZIPPING all around them.
          Solomon scowls as he watches them escape.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle as they run through the village.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          We have to get to the stable.
          Peter left his cart for us.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Peter? Where is he --?

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          It doesn't matter. Come on!

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Captain and his Soldiers have picked up a few
          followers. They're raising the alarm. A MOB is forming.

<b>                         CAPTAIN

          Henri leads Isabelle around the back and helps her into a
          cart that is waiting for them and unhitches the horse.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
          Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the
          cart... but then they hear a HOWL behind them.
          They look back. The Wolf emerges from the darkness,
          chasing after them. Henri whips the horse, urging it to
          go faster. They start to pull away from the Wolf, but
          then it veers off into the village and disappears.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          It's gone.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I don't think so...
          Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of
          Villagers. The Villagers start to give chase, but
          Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind.
          Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village,
          racing after the cart. It comes to a sheep pen and
          smashes through it. It comes to a large barn and leaps
          onto its roof, then leaps off again --
          -- and lands within striking distance of the cart. Henri
          drives the horse, but it's no use. The Wolf lunges,
          wrestling the horse to the ground. The horse cries out,
          its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying.
          Isabelle falls out and lands hard. Henri lies on his
          side, clutching his wrist. Isabelle pulls herself
          together and goes to him. She looks at his arm. It's
          visibly broken. She helps him to his feet --
          -- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart. The
          Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces. It glares
          at them with bloodthirsty eyes.
          Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is
          blocked -- the Villagers have caught up. They freeze at
          the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground. Isabelle
          and Henri are trapped. The Reeve shouts:

<b>                         REEVE
</b>          Take her! Take her and leave us
          in peace!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle.

</b>
<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          You can't outrun me, my dear. And
          there is no place you can hide
          that I cannot smell you out.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          So what is your decision? Will
          you take your place with me?

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          My place will never be with you.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          Where do you belong then? Here?
          With the cowards who so gladly
          sacrificed you to save themselves?

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          They're still good people.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          They are sheep. We are not like
          them. Let me show you what you
          are.
          The Wolf steps closer... but suddenly, Henri pushes
          Isabelle aside, pulls his hammer from his belt, and
          raises it to hit the Wolf.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Get away from her!
          The Reeve quickly grabs him. Henri struggles futilely,
          but Isabelle seizes the distraction. She snatches a
          Villager's torch and jabs it into the Wolf's side. The
          Wolf leaps back with an eerily human YELP of pain.
          Before it can react, Isabelle waves the torch at the
          Villagers, grabs Henri and they run away.
          The mob chases after them. Three Soldiers appear and
          join the mob. Figures silhouetted against the snow,
          angry faces lit by torchlight. It's like a nightmare.
          Suddenly, a cottage in front of the mob EXPLODES into
          pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it. It turns on the
          Villagers and Soldiers. It picks up a fallen roof beam
          in its powerful jaws, clenches them, trembling with rage,
          and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig.
          The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand
          their ground and the Wolf attacks.
          Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape... but there are
          more Soldiers up ahead. Isabelle and Henri quickly hide.

          Your grandmother is the Wolf.
          Isabelle recoils in disbelief. She shakes her head.

</b>          Wait! I have an idea.

<b>          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          A group of Villagers walks by. As they do, the Reeve
          hears something coming from behind the cottage...

<b>          HENRI (O.S.)
</b>          Come on!
          The Reeve follows the voice and sees two figures that
          look like Henri and Isabelle climb out the back window.

<b>                         REEVE
</b>          They're here! Over here!
          The two figures run and the Villagers chase after them.

          Henri and Isabelle hide behind a shed, just as the
          Villagers appear and spread out, trying to find them.
          Henri turns to Isabelle... only it's not Isabelle. It's
          Roxanne wearing Isabelle's clothes.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Can you keep going?

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          I can if you can.
          They run off, chased by the Villagers.

          Isabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed
          in Roxanne's clothes. The coast is clear. She runs off.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and
          races toward it. But then she hears a low GROWL ahead of
          her. Dark eyes peer from an open barn door. She turns
          and runs down an alley. The Wolf chases after her.
          As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly
          appears in front of her, blocking her path. She races
          back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two
          outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through,
          too narrow for the Wolf to follow.
          But as she runs, she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her.
          The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the
          buildings. It's right over her. It shoves its head
          through the narrow space above her, SNAPPING its jaws,
          but can't quite reach her. Then suddenly --
          -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the
          Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the
          narrow space. But Isabelle slips through, emerges from
          between the buildings, and is startled by a VOICE:

<b>          CAPTAIN (O.S.)
</b>          There!
          The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier
          with him. Isabelle runs. They chase after her...
          ... just as the Wolf frees itself. From the rooftop, it
          sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle. It races after them,
          running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage.
          Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall.
          There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle
          quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second --
          -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle. She
          grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go.
          Then she jumps down to the other side.
          The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is
          suddenly lifted right off his feet. The Captain looks
          up. The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has
          picked the Soldier up in its jaws. It glares down at the
          Captain. It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a
          dirty sock. The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a
          moment too long and then the Wolf is on him.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle's route has taken her right back to where she
          started. She spots the steeple and starts toward it...
          But there is someone here. Father Solomon. He's holding
          his silver sword. Isabelle freezes. For a moment, they
          just stand there, looking at one another. Then --
          Isabelle turns to run. Solomon is on her in an instant.
          He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the
          ground. She tries to get away, but he puts a knee in her
          back and ties her hands together with a length of rope.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          At least you won't die alone now.
          Your friends will all hang with
          you.
          Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father
          Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the
          Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon
          picks up his sword and stands to face it.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          If you come for her, you come
          through me.
          The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises
          his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the
          square, followed by a group of Villagers.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Stay back!
          Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch,
          breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another.
          Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on
          his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer.
          Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf
          leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword...
          ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon
          screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf
          twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy --
          -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the
          snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries
          out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS.

          menacing... and is struck in the head with a rock. The
          Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way.
          Henri picks up another rock and throws it.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          You bastard! You killed my

</b>          I'm not letting it take you.
          He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in
          the eye, tearing a gash in its face. The Wolf GROWLS.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Look! It bleeds! We can kill it
          if we stand together!
          The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them:

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Father Solomon was one man. His
          soldiers were mercenaries. But we
          are a village!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          He's right. It's a coward at
          heart. Look at it. Why doesn't
          it attack?
          The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but
          then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it.

<b>                         MERCHANT
</b>          You killed my daughter!
          Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around.
          Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it.
          It's surrounded. And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a
          solid wall of angry, determined men and women.
          The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but
          they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and
          farm implements. It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers,
          but there are too many of them.
          Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in
          agony. It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't
          reach it. Then Henri sees something in the snow...

          hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers
          gathered behind them. The Wolf trembles, blood dripping
          from its many wounds... then it turns to Isabelle.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          I will come for you again.
          And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The
          Villagers CHEER. The Reeve chases after it and the rest
          of the angry mob follows him. Henri turns to Isabelle.

<b>                         HENRI

          Isabelle nods, shaky. Then...

          They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.

</b>          I am bitten.
          Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri
          walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses
          himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns
          away. Isabelle doesn't.
          Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as
          Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword
          aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

          Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face
          are still bad, but healing. She's scarred for life.

          with Lucrece. Prudence sees her, then looks away.
          The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog.

          Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She
          stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter.

          back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then
          she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows
          her in the fog. She walks faster.
          She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The
          FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision.
          She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the
          abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks
          in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main
          path, she throws the branch aside...

          Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in
          darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look.

          Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on
          the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's
          knitting needles sticking out of it.

          Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a
          closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw.
          That's what it has been licking this whole time.
          Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a

          Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and
          pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes.
          It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup,
          spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away.
          She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours
          out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the
          pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs.

          groans. She's hurt. She stands up. She's much taller
          now than she was. As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the

<b>          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle opens the door and strolls outside, looking up
          at the sky. The moon is full.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          But sometimes, when the moon is
          full, my thoughts still turn to
          Peter. He promised me that I
          would never see him again. And I
          never have.
          Somewhere, a wolf HOWLS. Isabelle smiles.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          But I often wonder if I hear him.

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
          High on a hilltop, CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a WOLF
          staring down at the distant village. It's hard to tell
          in the moonlight whether it's a normal wolf...
          Or something else.
          It looks up at the bright full moon and HOWLS as we

<b>          FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>                         THE END
